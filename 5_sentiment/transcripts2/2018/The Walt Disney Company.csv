Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition.

Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition. The regulatory process as we got in numerous jurisdictions across the world and I spent the last several weeks meeting with a number of business leaders at Fox gaining insights that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations once we have regulatory approval. After these discussions, I'm even more enthusiastic about the businesses we're acquiring and the management teams that are leading them. 
As we said when we announced this deal, there are 3 primary strategic priorities fulfilled by this acquisition. It will deliver more content and the production capabilities and talent to produce even more. It will enhance our direct-to-consumer initiatives with platforms, technologies, brands and existing customer relationships to build on., and it will greatly diversify our businesses geographically. All three of these elements sync up perfectly with our own core strategies and all three are designed to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. 
As that process moves forward, there are numerous new initiatives and projects underway, and I'd like to update you on a few of them. As you recall, some months ago, we announced our intention to develop and launch an ESPN direct-to-consumer business. This new business will launch sometime this spring when we unveil a completely reconceived and redesigned ESPN app, which will deliver important new services and experiences to users. The changes will be dramatic, with more compelling visuals as well as an easy and intuitive interface and exceptional video and sound quality. Users will also enjoy an increasingly personalized experience as the app blends explicit choices with implicit behavior to curate a unique mix of specific, relevant content tailored to the taste of each individual user. This one app approach will deliver 3 main features. It will provide countless scores and highlights as well as podcasts and other sports information with a more user-friendly mobile interface. It will enable access to live streams of all ESPN networks, providing consumers or subscribers to multiple packages. And it will feature our new ESPN Plus subscription service, powered by BAMTech's proprietary technology, the service will offer a greatly expanded array of programs and live events for sports fans who want even more content as well as for fans interested in sports and events not currently featured on the main channel. 
This subscription service will feature thousands of additional live events, giving fans access to more leagues, more teams and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports as well as [indiscernible] tennis, boxing, golf, rugby and cricket that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks. 
Additionally, ESPN Plus will feature the full library of ESPN films, including the highly acclaimed 30 for 30 documentary series and we're also creating a robust slate of high-quality original content exclusively for this platform. 
As I noted earlier, we'll introduce this new app with its direct-to-consumer component this spring, and we're pricing ESPN Plus at $4.99 per month. It will be available on a variety of platforms at the time of launch, including iOS, Android, TB OS, Chromecast with more to follow. We're very excited to bring this product to market an opportunity created by our BAMTech acquisition. We plan to invest further in the direct-to-consumer feature, adding more live games and producing sports programming, along with even greater personalization in the years ahead. 
Our upcoming Disney DTC service will also combine the full range of BAMTech's capabilities, with some of the world's most popular IP to deliver a compelling consumer experience when it launches in late 2019. 
Turning to our studio. We're just days away from the highly anticipated release of Black Panther, which opens on February 16 and the buzz is palpable. At the moment, ticket presales are outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part by the phenomenal reaction to the premier last week. Marvel continues to defy expectations and redefine the superhero genre with each new release, constantly raising the bar with stories and characters that are fresh, compelling and spectacular. 
Black Panther is a great example, and we're thrilled with the attention and accolade it's receiving. It's exciting to see such tremendous enthusiasm for this film and its brilliant diverse cast. 
We've got a strong pipeline of major releases to follow, including the March 9 debut of Disney's Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava Duvernay and starting Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling. 
Our next Marvel movie of fiscal '18 Avengers: Infinity War will showcase the largest collection of Marvel characters ever seen on screen when it opens on May 4. And we'll release our second standalone Star Wars movie on May 25. The world got its first glimpse at Solo: A Star Wars Story this week, thanks to our a Super Bowl ad, and we followed that with a release of the movie's first trailer yesterday. The reaction has been fantastic. 
Han Solo is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Star Wars universe and there's clearly a lot of interest in its origin story.  
And the future of the Star Wars franchise just got even more exciting. In addition to next years Episode IX and the trilogy Ryan Johnson is developing for us, we just announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, creators of the epic Game of Thrones series, will write and produce a new series of original Star Wars films. 
Turning to Pixar, we released the Incredibles in 2004, and it remains one of the most popular Pixar films ever made. Its legions of fans around the world will be rewarded for their devotion and their patience when we release the long-awaited sequel, Incredibles 2 on June 15. 
Our release laid for the rest of 2018, 2019 and beyond is equally strong, and we'll talk more about those films in future calls. 
I also want to highlight our Parks and Resorts business, which continues to successfully leverage our incredible collection of IP to create and deliver an exceptional entertainment experience for millions of guests, as evidenced by their performance in Q1, all of which deepens our confidence and significant investments we are making to grow the business around the world, including commissioning 3 new cruise ships to expand our award-winning fleet, adding Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, building Star Wars Galaxies Edge in Disneyland and Disney World and preparing to incorporate more than our popular IP in the Disneyland Paris. 
The investments we've made in IP in addition to the numerous investments we've made across the world in our Parks and Resorts business have driven dramatic growth over the last decade, and we're confident this trend will continue well into the future. 
I'm going to try to call over to Christine to talk about the details of our results in the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,548611553,1381465,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2018",2018-02-06,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, most notably, a one time, $1.6 billion benefit associated with tax reform, earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were up 22% to $1.89. 
This $1.89 includes a $0.22 benefit from a lower federal tax rate in fiscal 2018. Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal tax rate is 24.5%. 
Turning to segment results. Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Operating income increased 21% due to growth at our domestic operations and Disneyland Paris. I'll note the year-over-year growth reflects the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Matthew and the dry dock at Disney Cruise Line during Q1 last year. 
At our domestic operations, operating income was up 18% over prior year, driven by higher results at domestic Parks and Resorts and growth at Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 6% in the quarter as Pandora - The World of Avatar, contributed to record attendance at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Walt Disney World overall and Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout contributed to higher attendance at Disneyland Resort. 
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% and occupancy was comparable to last year at 91%. 
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year despite reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments. Booked rates are pacing up 13%, which reflects our strategy of improving the guest experience through better load-balancing of attendance throughout the year as well as the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year, whereas, the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in Q3 last year. 
We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period will shift approximately $35 million in operating income from Q3 to Q2. This benefit will be partially offset by the impact of a 14-day Dry Dock of the Disney Magic, which will adversely affect Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. 
I'll also note, Disneyland Paris continue to benefit from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration, which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. The results at the new Q1 record in revenue and has now been profitable for the last 3 quarters, so we are very pleased with her progress we're making there. 
Total segment operating income margin was 26.1%, up 170 basis points compared to Q1 last year and represents the highest quarterly margin for the segment since 2004 when we began consolidating our international parks. 
At Media Networks, operating income declined during the first quarter primarily due to lower results at broadcasting and lower equity income. At broadcasting, we continue to see nice double digit growth in affiliate revenue. However, that was more than offset by lower advertising revenue, higher programming cost and lower operating income from program sales. 
The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower political advertising at our owned stations and lower ad revenue at the ABC network where higher rates were offset by a decline in impressions. 
Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC network is running 30% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income at A+E Television Networks, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from our investment in BAMTech. I'll note that due to our increase stake in BAMTech, BAMTech's results are now consolidated within cable networks. 
At cable, growth at Disney Channels and Freeform was offset by losses at BAMTech and lower results at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming expense was primarily driven by the timing of the 2 College Football Playoff semi final ballgames, which shifted out of Q1 this year into Q2, partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was down 11% in the quarter, reflecting a decrease in impressions and lower rates, which were adversely impacted by the timing of the College Football Playoff semi final ballgames. 
Like last year, ESPN aired three of the New Year's 6 ballgames during the quarter. However, this year, the 2 semifinal games aired during the second quarter. We estimate Q1 ad revenue was down 7% excluding the impact of the 2 semi final ballgames shifting into Q2 this year. 
So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales pacing is comparable to last year and reflects the timing benefit of the 2 semi final ballgames. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about the 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
At the studio, first quarter results were modestly lower compared to last year as growth in theatrical distribution was offset by lower operating income and our Home Entertainment and Television Distribution businesses. 
Our theatrical business had another solid quarter due to the strong performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is our third Star Wars films and through today, these 3 films have collectively generated over $4.4 billion in global box office. 
Lower home entertainment operating income reflects lower unit sales driven by the strong performance of Finding Dory last year compared to Cars 3 in Q1 this year. Lower television distribution results were primarily due to a decrease in pay television, driven by the domestic availability of 2 key titles in Q1 last year: Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, compared to one key title ayatollah, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in Q1 this year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by the growth in our Games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 12.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 17.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. 
Earlier, I quantified 2 impacts of tax reform to our Q1 results. First, the $1.6 billion one-time net benefit, driven primarily by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability; and second, a $0.22 benefit in the quarter due to the lower statutory rate. 
As I mentioned earlier, our applicable federal statutory tax rate is 24.5% for fiscal 2018. For future years, the federal tax rate will be 21%. 
In recent years, our effective tax rate has closely mirrored the statutory rate, and we continue to expect that to be the case going forward. 
As we look to the second quarter, there are a few factors I'd like to highlight that will influence Q2 comparisons. We expect cable expense growth to be up mid-teens, reflecting the consolidation of BAMTech and higher programming expenses at ESPN, primarily due to the timing of the college football semifinal games. There is no change in our full year cable expense growth forecast of high single digits, driven by BAMTech and up low single digits on a comparable basis. 
At broadcasting, results will reflect a $55 million decline in operating income from program sales due largely to the timing of domestic SVOD in international sales. 
At the studio, I'll remind you, we had a very strong second quarter last year due to the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. 
We also have 2 releases this quarter versus one in the prior year, which will drive higher marketing expenses. 
So while we are excited about the release of Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time, these factors create a very difficult comparison at Studio Entertainment. 
And finally, last month, we announced a one-time bonus to 125,000 cast members. We expect roughly half of the forecast expense, or about $55 million, to fall in the second quarter with roughly $40 million recorded at Parks and Resorts. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

And so the app that we are launching sometime this spring, we didn't give a specific date, we'll be at completely new app. The app itself, will have 3 primary features as I've been saying, but I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down in a couple of them. The first is the obvious it will have tons of scores and highlights, and new stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use BAMTech engine data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization customization perspective that, that can provide. That will by the way, be evidenced in both video as well as in the -- basically, the written work that's presented, the stories that are presented customizable, obviously, by teams, by locations, by general interest, but also basically machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more.  The second feature is live streaming of the network themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so if you are in subscriber who are existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously, the app will provide that, the watch app does not, but you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I air play, I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television. And then of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature, we're actually going at ESPN Plus because it's offering on incremental, thousands of hours of live sports programming basically to the ESPN experience, and then in addition to that, that will be the home of the 30 for 30 series, the entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. We'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app. So it's a 3 in 1, completely new experience, on your technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but if anything, points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it will be this app and the experience as it provides [indiscernible]"

We're looking at the number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure it. Clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. I mean, conformity that just mean basically being more efficient, being more consistent and using basically our best talent and based the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible.  In terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management to some extent some sales as well. Because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences, but also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility. On the Lucasfilm question you asked and David Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. So what they have an idea about a number of films and at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They are focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there. We are developing not just one, but a few Star Wars series, specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. we've mentioned that and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us, but because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we are pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating, not just Star Wars, but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find a level of talent that will be on -- call it, the television front will be rather significant as well."

And they're both large lands, they're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building. I'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that, that franchise is still quite popular, we're making value a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019. We feel good about. They're large in size, 10 acres I'm being told versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they are not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that.

The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tenfold movie direction, but also in -- call it, specialty movie direction, the Fox 2000 and Fox Searchlight businesses has, for instance. And there is also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences. In addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, two very specific examples of that as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX. And so we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and obviously, production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really -- and this is, I think, needs to be considered on a global basis. So obviously as application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms."

And the best way to think about that how it's going to fall, you can expect about 1/3 of that to impact our Q2 results. So the increase is largely related to the content licensed from Hulu's equity owners and as one of the equity owners, our portion of these incremental cost will largely be recouped by ABC's program sales as well as affiliate revenues to some of our various networks."

But then Christine, when you sort of laid out the sub loss, I think you said minus 3% effect on cable networks, which is the same as minus 3% last quarter. So I supposed we're just talking about rounding here in terms of a moderation, but not enough to change that number. Just wanted to confirm that. I think it's still important.

And we believe the trends in terms of growth in the new over-the-top or digital platforms will continue. And hopefully, they'll continue to offset because the growth is getting compelling. The loss is on the traditional side. On the Shanghai front, there are a few things there. We didn't know that because Shanghai has just had a great year, including some days where they just had unbelievable records, well, over 60,000 -- I think 65,000, 68,000 on one day in October. At the comparisons to a year ago relatively similar because we just had a great year consistently. It was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a 3-tier pricing strategy, and that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26, and so that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity. And we have on the drawing board a number of other potential expansions. We've got some discussions underway with our partners there to address some of that in the months and then, of course, the years ahead. But Shanghai is doing quite well."

And then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth, theme parks being a great example with the expansion that we've talked about not just by the way, Shanghai about the expansion of every part and every resort around the world and the commitment to build 3 new cruise ships, and that's all benefited us greatly. As we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar brand, except as I said earlier, too, when the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, I think you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time. In terms of how we might look at the outer capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth, and in this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and essentially, absorbing those assets, we'll probably -- I'm not likely to say something specific. What we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer products, which is not in the market you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product of course, but not necessarily to go in a volume direction say that Netflix has gone. Because we have this unique brand proposition and the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volumes. Not suggest that we're going to be lower because we, obviously, are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective, but when you go-to-market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel-branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases using very well-known IP. We're developing a monster series, we're developing a High School Musical series, we're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few, that will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we have gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands."

Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition. The regulatory processes began in numerous jurisdictions across the world, and I spent the last several weeks meeting with a number of business leaders at Fox, gaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations once we have regulatory approval. After these discussions, I'm even more enthusiastic about the businesses we're acquiring and the management teams that are leading them. 
As we said when we announced this deal, there are 3 primary strategic priorities fulfilled by this acquisition. It will deliver more content and the production capabilities and talent to produce even more. It will enhance our direct-to-consumer initiatives with platforms, technologies, brands and existing customer relationships to build on. And it will greatly diversify our businesses geographically. All 3 of these elements sync up perfectly with our own core strategies, and all 3 are designed to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. 
As that process moves forward, there are numerous new initiatives and projects underway, and I'd like to update you on a few of them. As you recall, some months ago, we announced our intention to develop and launch an ESPN direct-to-consumer business. This new business will launch sometime this spring, when we unveil a completely reconceived and redesigned ESPN app, which will deliver important new services and experiences to users. The changes will be dramatic, with more compelling visuals as well as an easy, intuitive interface and exceptional video and sound quality. Users will also enjoy an increasingly personalized experience as the app blends explicit choices with implicit behavior to curate a unique mix of specific, relevant content tailored to the taste of each individual user. This one app approach will deliver 3 main features. It will provide countless scores and highlights as well as podcasts and other sports information with a more user-friendly mobile interface. It will enable access to live streams of all ESPN networks, providing consumers or subscribers to multichannel packages. And it will feature our new ESPN Plus subscription service. Powered by BAMTech's proprietary technology, the service will offer a greatly expanded array of programs and live events for sports fans who want even more content as well as for fans interested in sports and events not currently featured on the main channels. 
This subscription service will feature thousands of additional live events, giving fans access to more leagues, more teams and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports as well as Grand Slam tennis, boxing, golf, rugby and cricket that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks. 
Additionally, ESPN Plus will feature the full library of ESPN films, including the highly acclaimed 30 for 30 documentary series, and we're also creating a robust slate of high-quality original content exclusively for this platform. 
As I noted earlier, we'll introduce this new app with its direct-to-consumer component this spring, and we're pricing ESPN Plus at $4.99 per month. It will be available on a variety of platforms at the time of launch, including iOS, Android, tvOS, Chromecast, with more to follow. We're very excited to bring this product to market, an opportunity created by our BAMTech acquisition. We plan to invest further in the direct-to-consumer feature, adding more live games and produce sports programming, along with even greater personalization, in the years ahead. Our upcoming Disney DTC service will also combine the full range of BAMTech's capabilities with some of the world's most popular IP to deliver a compelling consumer experience when it launches in late 2019. 
Turning to our studio. We're just days away from the highly anticipated release of Black Panther, which opens on February 16, and the buzz is palpable. At the moment, ticket presales are outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part by the phenomenal reaction to the premier last week. Marvel continues to defy expectations and redefine the superhero genre with each new release, constantly raising the bar with stories and characters that are fresh, compelling and spectacular. Black Panther is a great example, and we're thrilled with the attention and accolade it's receiving. It's exciting to see such tremendous enthusiasm for this film and its brilliant, diverse cast. 
We've got a strong pipeline of major releases to follow, including the March 9 debut of Disney's A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay and starting Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling. 
Our next Marvel movie in fiscal '18, Avengers: Infinity War, will showcase the largest collection of Marvel characters ever seen on screen when it opens May 4. And we'll release our second stand-alone Star Wars movie on May 25. The world got its first glimpse of Solo: A Star Wars Story this week, thanks to our Super Bowl ad, and we followed that with the release of the movie's first trailer yesterday. The reaction has been fantastic. 
Han Solo is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Star Wars universe, and there's clearly a lot of interest in his origin story.  
And the future of the Star Wars franchise just got even more exciting. In addition to next year's Episode IX and the trilogy Rian Johnson is developing for us, we just announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, creators of the epic Game of Thrones series, will write and produce a new series of original Star Wars films. 
Turning to Pixar. We released the Incredibles in 2004, and it remains one of the most popular Pixar films ever made. Its legions of fans around the world will be rewarded for their devotion and their patience when we release the long-awaited sequel, Incredibles 2, on June 15. Our release slate for the rest of 2018, 2019 and beyond is equally strong, and we'll talk more about those films on future calls. 
I also want to highlight our Parks and Resorts business, which continues to successfully leverage our incredible collection of IP to create and deliver an exceptional entertainment experience for millions of guests, as evidenced by their performance in Q1, all of which deepens our confidence in the significant investments we're making to grow the business around the world, including commissioning 3 new cruise ships to expand our award-winning fleet, adding Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, building Star Wars Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland and Disney World and preparing to incorporate more of our popular IP into Disneyland Paris. The investments we've made in IP, in addition to the numerous investments we've made across the world in our Parks and Resorts businesses, have driven dramatic growth over the last decade, and we're confident this trend will continue well into the future. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about the details of our results in the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,548611553,1381608,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2018",2018-02-06,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

This $1.89 includes a",1362,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, most notably a onetime $1.6 billion benefit associated with tax reform, earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were up 22% to $1.89. This $1.89 includes a $0.22 benefit from a lower federal tax rate in fiscal 2018. Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal tax rate is 24.5%. 
Turning to segment results. Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Operating income increased 21% due to growth at our domestic operations and Disneyland Paris. I'll note the year-over-year growth reflects the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Matthew and the dry-dock at Disney Cruise Line during Q1 last year. 
At our domestic operations, operating income was up 18% over prior year, driven by higher results at domestic Parks and Resorts and growth at Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 6% in the quarter as Pandora - The World of Avatar contributed to record attendance at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Walt Disney World overall, and Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT! contributed to higher attendance at Disneyland Resort. 
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was comparable to last year at 91%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year despite reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments. Booked rates are pacing up 13%, which reflects our strategy of improving the guest experience through better load-balancing of attendants throughout the year as well as the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year, whereas the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in Q3 last year. 
We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period will shift approximately $35 million in operating income from Q3 to Q2. This benefit will be partially offset by the impact of a 14-day dry-dock of the Disney Magic, which will adversely affect Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. 
I'll also note, Disneyland Paris continued to benefit from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration, which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. The resort set a new Q1 record in revenue and has now been profitable for the last 3 quarters, so we are very pleased with the progress we're making there. 
Total segment operating income margin was 26.1%, up 170 basis points compared to Q1 last year and represents the highest quarterly margin for the segment since 2004, when we began consolidating our international parks. 
At Media Networks, operating income declined during the first quarter primarily due to lower results at Broadcasting and lower equity income. At Broadcasting, we continue to see nice double-digit growth in affiliate revenue. However, that was more than offset by lower advertising revenue, higher programming cost and lower operating income from program sales. The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower political advertising at our owned stations and lower ad revenue at the ABC Network, where higher rates were offset by a decline in impressions.  Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income at A+E Television Networks, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from our investment in BAMTech. I'll note that due to our increased stake in BAMTech, BAMTech's results are now consolidated within Cable Networks. 
At Cable, growth at Disney Channels and Freeform was offset by losses at BAMTech and lower results at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming expense was primarily driven by the timing of the 2 College Football Playoff semifinal ballgames, which shifted out of Q1 this year into Q2, partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 11% in the quarter, reflecting a decrease in impressions and lower rates, which were adversely impacted by the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal ballgames. 
Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's 6 ballgames during the first quarter. However, this year, the 2 semifinal games aired during the second quarter. We estimate Q1 ad revenue was down 7%, excluding the impact of the 2 semifinal ballgames shifting into Q2 this year. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales pacing is comparable to last year and reflects the timing benefit of the 2 semifinal ballgames. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
At the studio, first quarter results were modestly lower compared to last year as growth in theatrical distribution was offset by lower operating income in our home entertainment and television distribution businesses. Our theatrical business had another solid quarter due to the strong performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is our third Star Wars film, and through today, these 3 films have collectively generated over $4.4 billion in global box office. 
Lower home entertainment operating income reflects lower unit sales, driven by the strong performance of Finding Dory last year compared to Cars 3 in Q1 this year. Lower television distribution results were primarily due to a decrease in pay television, driven by the domestic availability of 2 key titles in Q1 last year, Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, compared to one key title, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, in Q1 this year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by growth in our games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 12.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 17.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. 
Earlier, I quantified 2 impacts of tax reform to our Q1 results: first, the $1.6 billion onetime net benefit, driven primarily by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability; and second, a $0.22 benefit in the quarter due to the lower statutory rate. As I mentioned earlier, our applicable federal statutory tax rate is 24.5% for fiscal 2018. For future years, the federal tax rate will be 21%. In recent years, our effective tax rate has closely mirrored the statutory rate, and we continue to expect that to be the case going forward. 
As we look to the second quarter, there are a few factors I'd like to highlight that will influence Q2 comparisons. We expect cable expense growth to be up mid-teens, reflecting the consolidation of BAMTech and higher programming expenses at ESPN primarily due to the timing of the College Football semifinal games. There is no change in our full year cable expense growth forecast of high single digits, driven by BAMTech, and up low single digits on a comparable basis. 
At Broadcasting, results will reflect a $55 million decline in operating income from program sales due largely to the timing of the domestic SVOD in international sales. 
At the studio, I'll remind you we had a very strong second quarter last year due to the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. We also have 2 releases this quarter versus 1 in the prior year, which will drive higher marketing expenses. So while we are excited about the release of Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time, these factors create a very difficult comparison at Studio Entertainment. 
And finally, last month, we announced a onetime bonus to 125,000 cast members. We expect roughly half of the forecasted expense or about $55 million to fall in the second quarter, with roughly $40 million recorded at Parks and Resorts. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

And so the app that we are launching sometime this spring, we didn't give a specific date, will be a completely new app. The app itself will have 3 primary features, as I've been saying, but I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down on a couple of them. The first is the obvious. It will have tons of scores and highlights and new stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use BAMTech engine, data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization/customization perspective that, that can provide. That will, by the way, be evidenced in both video as well as in the, basically, the written word that's presented, the stories that are presented, customizable, obviously, by teams, by locations, by general interest. But also, the, basically, machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more. The second feature is live streaming of the networks themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so if you are a subscriber to an existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that to stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously, the app will provide that. The watch app today does that, but you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I AirPlay. I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television. And then, of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature. We're actually calling it ESPN Plus because it's offering an incremental thousands of hours of live sports programming, basically, to the ESPN experience. And then in addition to that, that will be the home of the 30 for 30 series. The entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. We'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app. So it's a 3-in-1, completely new experience, new technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but if anything points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it will be this app and the experience that it provides."

And so it will power a number of different sort of go-to-consumer experiences. And I can't really say what we will do post regulatory approval on the Fox acquisition. We're looking at a number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure. Clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. When I mean conformity, I just mean basically being more efficient, being more consistent and using basically our best talent and the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible. In terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management, to some extent, some sales as well because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences but also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility. On the Lucasfilm question you asked of Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars-based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. So what they have an idea about, a number of films, and at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They're focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there. We are developing not just one but a few Star Wars series specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. We've mentioned that, and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us. But because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we're pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating not just Star Wars but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find that the level of talent that will be on the, if you call it, television front will be rather significant as well."

We broke ground on that, I think, actually, before we actually opened Shanghai. And other one is being built in Orlando, and that will be opened some point later this year, but we have not announced the date. And they are both large lands. They're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building. I'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that, that franchise is still quite popular, we're making a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019. We feel good about it. They're large in size, 10 acres, I'm being told, versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they're not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that. And they'll have very, very distinct IP from Toy Story. So in other words, people will know exactly what the experience is going to be. We're basically a [indiscernible] in a toy world. Your first question, I think the way to look at the revenue opportunities particularly as it relates to production is to consider the fact that what we're buying here is significant production capabilities and, with that, the talent to produce on our behalf. The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tentpole movie direction but also in the, well, call it, specialty movie direction. The Fox 2000 and Fox Searchlight businesses has it, for instance. And there's also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences. In addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, 2 very specific examples of that, as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX. And so we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and, obviously, production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really -- and this, I think, needs to be considered on a global basis. So this, obviously, is application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms."

This is probably the farthest you've made it through an earnings call in years without somebody asking about pay TV subs. So I'm sorry to do this to you. I really am. But I have to ask -- it's really just a slight clarification. Bob, I think you were on CNBC after hours saying -- I think you used the word that maybe industry sub -- or sub losses for you were moderating a bit, I think. I don't want to put words in your mouth. But then, Christine, when you sort of laid out the sub loss, I think you said minus 3% effect on Cable Networks, which is the same as the minus 3% last quarter. So I suppose we're just talking about rounding here in terms of a moderation but not enough to change that number. Just wanted to confirm that because I think it's still important. And the second quick one, Christine, on the parks, you laid out a lot of things going on there, and I appreciate that. I don't think I heard Shanghai called out. I apologize if I missed it. Would love if you will -- if you did -- if you could just share something on that. How is it -- is revenue up or down? Is attendance up or down? Is OI up or down? That sort of thing. Anything you can share would be great."

I mentioned on the CNBC interview that we're noticing that people are coming into, basically, the multichannel world or subscribing that were previously considered cord nevers. Clearly, the lower price, the fewer channels and the more sort of mobile-first and improved, basically, user experience are all having an impact on attracting new consumers. And we believe the trends in terms of growth in the new over-the-top or digital platforms will continue. And hopefully, they'll continue to offset, because the growth is getting compelling, the losses on the traditional side. On the Shanghai front, there are a few things there. We didn't know that -- because Shanghai has had just a great year, including some days where they've just had unbelievable records, well over 60,000, I think 65,000, 68,000 in attendance on one day in October. And the comparisons to a year ago are relatively similar because we've had just a great year consistently. It was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a 3-tier pricing strategy, and that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward, provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26, and so that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity. And we have on the drawing board a number of other potential expansions. We've got some discussions underway with our partners there to address some of that in the months and then, of course, the years ahead. But Shanghai is doing quite well."

A",485,"Well, in the earlier interview that I did on CNBC, I was asked a similar question. We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks. Actually, we got more aggressive in the last few years. And then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth, Theme Parks being a great example of that with the expansion that we've talked about, not just, by the way, Shanghai but the expansion of every park and resort around the world and then the commitment to build 3 new cruise ships. And that's all benefited us greatly. As we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar blend, except, as I said earlier, too, with the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, I think you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time. In terms of how we might allocate the other capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth, and in this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and, essentially, absorbing those assets, we'll probably -- I'm not likely to say something specific. What we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer product, which is not in the market and you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that it will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product, of course, but not necessarily to go in the volume direction, say, that Netflix has gone because we have this unique brand proposition. And the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volumes. Not to suggest that we're going to be low because we obviously are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective. But when you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel-branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases, using very well-known IP. We're developing a Monsters series. We're developing a High School Musical series. We're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few. That will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands."

I know they mentioned that they had in excess of 17 million subs, and we're not going to update that. We'll leave it to their team if and when they choose to do so.

Also, I just would mention, for 2Q, when you're looking at it, we did have the benefit of some licensee fee settlements that we called out in our press release last year, so that's going to be a comparability factor in 2Q. But getting back to your other question on the business overall, for the balance of the year, we're very confident in our film slate and the associated IP and how it will impact our Consumer Products business. We have Star Wars: The Last Jedi out now. We'll have Solo out in the spring. We have 4 movies: Thor, which has already come out; the other 3, Black Panther, Avengers and Ant-Man and the Wasp.

Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition. The regulatory processes began in numerous jurisdictions across the world, and I spent the last several weeks meeting with a number of business leaders at Fox, gaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations once we have regulatory approval. After these discussions, I'm even more enthusiastic about the businesses we're acquiring and the management teams that are leading them. 
As we said when we announced this deal, there are 3 primary strategic priorities fulfilled by this acquisition. It will deliver more content and the production capabilities and talent to produce even more. It will enhance our direct-to-consumer initiatives with platforms, technologies, brands and existing customer relationships to build on. And it will greatly diversify our businesses geographically. All 3 of these elements sync up perfectly with our own core strategies, and all 3 are designed to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. 
As that process moves forward, there are numerous new initiatives and projects underway, and I'd like to update you on a few of them. As you recall, some months ago, we announced our intention to develop and launch an ESPN direct-to-consumer business. This new business will launch sometime this spring, when we unveil a completely reconceived and redesigned ESPN app, which will deliver important new services and experiences to users. The changes will be dramatic, with more compelling visuals as well as an easy, intuitive interface and exceptional video and sound quality. Users will also enjoy an increasingly personalized experience as the app blends explicit choices with implicit behavior to curate a unique mix of specific, relevant content tailored to the taste of each individual user. This one app approach will deliver 3 main features. It will provide countless scores and highlights as well as podcasts and other sports information with a more user-friendly mobile interface. It will enable access to live streams of all ESPN networks, providing consumers or subscribers to multichannel packages. And it will feature our new ESPN Plus subscription service. Powered by BAMTech's proprietary technology, the service will offer a greatly expanded array of programs and live events for sports fans who want even more content as well as for fans interested in sports and events not currently featured on the main channels. 
This subscription service will feature thousands of additional live events, giving fans access to more leagues, more teams and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports as well as Grand Slam tennis, boxing, golf, rugby and cricket that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks. 
Additionally, ESPN Plus will feature the full library of ESPN films, including the highly acclaimed 30 for 30 documentary series, and we're also creating a robust slate of high-quality original content exclusively for this platform. 
As I noted earlier, we'll introduce this new app with its direct-to-consumer component this spring, and we're pricing ESPN Plus at $4.99 per month. It will be available on a variety of platforms at the time of launch, including iOS, Android, tvOS, Chromecast, with more to follow. We're very excited to bring this product to market, an opportunity created by our BAMTech acquisition. We plan to invest further in the direct-to-consumer feature, adding more live games and produce sports programming, along with even greater personalization, in the years ahead. Our upcoming Disney DTC service will also combine the full range of BAMTech's capabilities with some of the world's most popular IP to deliver a compelling consumer experience when it launches in late 2019. 
Turning to our studio. We're just days away from the highly anticipated release of Black Panther, which opens on February 16, and the buzz is palpable. At the moment, ticket presales are outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part by the phenomenal reaction to the premier last week. Marvel continues to defy expectations and redefine the superhero genre with each new release, constantly raising the bar with stories and characters that are fresh, compelling and spectacular. Black Panther is a great example, and we're thrilled with the attention and accolades it's receiving. It's exciting to see such tremendous enthusiasm for this film and its brilliant, diverse cast. 
We've got a strong pipeline of major releases to follow, including the March 9 debut of Disney's A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay and starting Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling. 
Our next Marvel movie in fiscal '18, Avengers: Infinity War, will showcase the largest collection of Marvel characters ever seen on screen when it opens May 4. And we'll release our second stand-alone Star Wars movie on May 25. The world got its first glimpse of Solo: A Star Wars Story this week, thanks to our Super Bowl ad, and we followed that with the release of the movie's first trailer yesterday. The reaction has been fantastic. 
Han Solo is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Star Wars universe, and there's clearly a lot of interest in his origin story.  
And the future of the Star Wars franchise just got even more exciting. In addition to next year's Episode IX and the trilogy Rian Johnson is developing for us, we just announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, creators of the epic Game of Thrones series, will write and produce a new series of original Star Wars films. 
Turning to Pixar. We released the Incredibles in 2004, and it remains one of the most popular Pixar films ever made. Its legions of fans around the world will be rewarded for their devotion and their patience when we release the long-awaited sequel, Incredibles 2, on June 15. Our release slate for the rest of 2018, 2019 and beyond is equally strong, and we'll talk more about those films on future calls. 
I also want to highlight our Parks and Resorts business, which continues to successfully leverage our incredible collection of IP to create and deliver an exceptional entertainment experience for millions of guests, as evidenced by their performance in Q1, all of which deepens our confidence in the significant investments we're making to grow the business around the world, including commissioning 3 new cruise ships to expand our award-winning fleet, adding Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, building Star Wars Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland and Disney World and preparing to incorporate more of our popular IP into Disneyland Paris. The investments we've made in IP, in addition to the numerous investments we've made across the world in our Parks and Resorts businesses, have driven dramatic growth over the last decade, and we're confident this trend will continue well into the future. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about the details of our results in the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,548611553,1381666,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2018",2018-02-06,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

This $1.89 includes a",1365,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, most notably a onetime $1.6 billion benefit associated with tax reform, earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were up 22% to $1.89. This $1.89 includes a $0.22 benefit from a lower federal tax rate in fiscal 2018. Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal tax rate is 24.5%. 
Turning to segment results. Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Operating income increased 21% due to growth at our domestic operations and Disneyland Paris. I'll note the year-over-year growth reflects the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Matthew and the dry-dock at Disney Cruise Line during Q1 last year. 
At our domestic operations, operating income was up 18% over prior year, driven by higher results at domestic Parks and Resorts and growth at Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 6% in the quarter as Pandora - The World of Avatar contributed to record attendance at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Walt Disney World overall, and Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT! contributed to higher attendance at Disneyland Resort. 
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was comparable to last year at 91%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year despite reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments. Booked rates are pacing up 13%, which reflects our strategy of improving the guest experience through better load-balancing of attendance throughout the year as well as the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year, whereas the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in Q3 last year. 
We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period will shift approximately $35 million in operating income from Q3 to Q2. This benefit will be partially offset by the impact of a 14-day dry-dock of the Disney Magic, which will adversely affect Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. 
I'll also note, Disneyland Paris continued to benefit from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration, which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. The resort set a new Q1 record in revenue and has now been profitable for the last 3 quarters, so we are very pleased with the progress we're making there. 
Total segment operating income margin was 26.1%, up 170 basis points compared to Q1 last year and represents the highest quarterly margin for the segment since 2004, when we began consolidating our international parks. 
At Media Networks, operating income declined during the first quarter primarily due to lower results at Broadcasting and lower equity income. At Broadcasting, we continue to see nice double-digit growth in affiliate revenue. However, that was more than offset by lower advertising revenue, higher programming cost and lower operating income from program sales. The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower political advertising at our owned stations and lower ad revenue at the ABC Network, where higher rates were offset by a decline in impressions.  Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income at A+E Television Networks, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from our investment in BAMTech. I'll note that due to our increased stake in BAMTech, BAMTech's results are now consolidated within Cable Networks. 
At Cable, growth at Disney Channels and Freeform was offset by losses at BAMTech and lower results at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming expense was primarily driven by the timing of the 2 College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games, which shifted out of Q1 this year into Q2, partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 11% in the quarter, reflecting a decrease in impressions and lower rates, which were adversely impacted by the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal ballgames. 
Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's 6 bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year, the 2 semifinal games aired during the second quarter. We estimate Q1 ad revenue was down 7%, excluding the impact of the 2 semifinal bowl games shifting into Q2 this year. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales pacing is comparable to last year and reflects the timing benefit of the 2 semifinal ballgames. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
At the studio, first quarter results were modestly lower compared to last year as growth in theatrical distribution was offset by lower operating income in our home entertainment and television distribution businesses. Our theatrical business had another solid quarter due to the strong performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is our third Star Wars film, and through today, these 3 films have collectively generated over $4.4 billion in global box office. 
Lower home entertainment operating income reflects lower unit sales, driven by the strong performance of Finding Dory last year compared to Cars 3 in Q1 this year. Lower television distribution results were primarily due to a decrease in pay television, driven by the domestic availability of 2 key titles in Q1 last year, Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, compared to one key title, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, in Q1 this year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by growth in our games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 12.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 17.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. 
Earlier, I quantified 2 impacts of tax reform to our Q1 results: first, the $1.6 billion onetime net benefit, driven primarily by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability; and second, a $0.22 benefit in the quarter due to the lower statutory rate. As I mentioned earlier, our applicable federal statutory tax rate is 24.5% for fiscal 2018. For future years, the federal tax rate will be 21%. In recent years, our effective tax rate has closely mirrored the statutory rate, and we continue to expect that to be the case going forward. 
As we look to the second quarter, there are a few factors I'd like to highlight that will influence Q2 comparisons. We expect cable expense growth to be up mid-teens, reflecting the consolidation of BAMTech and higher programming expenses at ESPN primarily due to the timing of the College Football semifinal games. There is no change in our full year cable expense growth forecast of high single digits, driven by BAMTech, and up low single digits on a comparable basis. 
At Broadcasting, results will reflect a $55 million decline in operating income from program sales due largely to the timing of the domestic SVOD in international sales. 
At the studio, I'll remind you we had a very strong second quarter last year due to the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. We also have 2 releases this quarter versus 1 in the prior year, which will drive higher marketing expenses. So while we are excited about the release of Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time, these factors create a very difficult comparison at Studio Entertainment. 
And finally, last month, we announced a onetime bonus to 125,000 cast members. We expect roughly half of the forecasted expense or about $55 million to fall in the second quarter, with roughly $40 million recorded at Parks and Resorts. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

And so the app that we are launching sometime this spring, we didn't give a specific date, will be a completely new app. The app itself will have 3 primary features, as I've been saying, but I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down on a couple of them. The first is the obvious. It will have tons of scores and highlights and news stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use BAMTech engine, data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization/customization perspective that, that can provide. That will, by the way, be evidenced in both video as well as in the, basically, the written word that's presented, the stories that are presented, customizable, obviously, by teams, by locations, by general interest. But also, the, basically, machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more. The second feature is live streaming of the networks themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so if you are a subscriber to an existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that to stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously, the app will provide that. The watch app today does that, but you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I AirPlay. I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television. And then, of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature. We're actually calling it ESPN Plus because it's offering an incremental thousands of hours of live sports programming, basically, to the ESPN experience. And then in addition to that, that will be the home of the 30 for 30 series. The entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. We'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app. So it's a 3-in-1, completely new experience, new technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but if anything points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it will be this app and the experience that it provides."

And so it will power a number of different sort of go-to-consumer experiences. And I can't really say what we will do post regulatory approval on the Fox acquisition. We're looking at a number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure. Clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. When I mean conformity, I just mean basically being more efficient, being more consistent and using basically our best talent and the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible. In terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management, to some extent, some sales as well because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences but also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility. On the Lucasfilm question you asked of Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars-based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. So what they have an idea about, a number of films, and at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They're focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there. We are developing not just one but a few Star Wars series specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. We've mentioned that, and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us. But because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we're pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating not just Star Wars but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find that the level of talent that will be on the, if you call it, television front will be rather significant as well."

We broke ground on that, I think, actually, before we actually opened Shanghai. And other one is being built in Orlando, and that will be opened some point later this year, but we have not announced the date. And they are both large lands. They're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building. I'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that, that franchise is still quite popular, we're making a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019. We feel good about it. They're large in size, 10 acres, I'm being told, versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they're not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that. And they'll have very, very distinct IP from Toy Story. So in other words, people will know exactly what the experience is going to be. We basically immerse you in a toy world. Your first question, I think the way to look at the revenue opportunities particularly as it relates to production is to consider the fact that what we're buying here is significant production capabilities and, with that, the talent to produce on our behalf. The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tentpole movie direction but also in the, well, call it, specialty movie direction. The Fox 2000 and Fox Searchlight businesses as a for instance. And there's also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences. In addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, 2 very specific examples of that, as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX. And so we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and, obviously, production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really -- and this, I think, needs to be considered on a global basis. So this, obviously, is application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms."

I mentioned on the CNBC interview that we're noticing that people are coming into, basically, the multichannel world or subscribing that were previously considered cord nevers. Clearly, the lower price, the fewer channels and the more sort of mobile-first and improved, basically, user experience are all having an impact on attracting new consumers. And we believe the trends in terms of growth in the new over-the-top or digital platforms will continue. And hopefully, they'll continue to offset, because the growth is getting compelling, the losses on the traditional side. On the Shanghai front, there are a few things there. We didn't note it, but Shanghai has had just a great year, including some days where they've just had unbelievable records, well over 60,000, I think 65,000, 68,000 in attendance on one day in October. And the comparisons to a year ago are relatively similar because we've had just a great year consistently. It was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a 3-tier pricing strategy, and that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward, provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26, and so that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity. And we have on the drawing board a number of other potential expansions. We've got some discussions underway with our partners there to address some of that in the months and then, of course, the years ahead. But Shanghai is doing quite well."

A",485,"Well, in the earlier interview that I did on CNBC, I was asked a similar question. We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks. Actually, we got more aggressive in the last few years. And then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth, Theme Parks being a great example of that with the expansion that we've talked about, not just, by the way, Shanghai but the expansion of every park and resort around the world and then the commitment to build 3 new cruise ships. And that's all benefited us greatly. As we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar blend, except, as I said earlier, too, with the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, I think you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time. In terms of how we might allocate the other capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth, and in this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and, essentially, absorbing those assets, we'll probably -- I'm not likely to say something specific. What we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer product, which is not in the market and you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that it will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product, of course, but not necessarily to go in the volume direction, say, that Netflix has gone because we have this unique brand proposition. And the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volumes. Not to suggest that we're going to be low because we obviously are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective. But when you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel-branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases, using very well-known IP. We're developing a Monsters series. We're developing a High School Musical series. We're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few. That will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands."

So they're ramping up their volume. They're also packaging the subscription service with a multi-subscription SVOD service with a multichannel service, and that product is doing quite well. I know they mentioned that they had in excess of 17 million subs, and we're not going to update that. We'll leave it to their team if and when they choose to do so.

Also, I just would mention, for 2Q, when you're looking at it, we did have the benefit of some licensee  settlements that we called out in our press release last year, so that's going to be a comparability factor in 2Q.

Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition. The regulatory processes began in numerous jurisdictions across the world, and I spent the last several weeks meeting with a number of business leaders at Fox, gaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations once we have regulatory approval. After these discussions, I'm even more enthusiastic about the businesses we're acquiring and the management teams that are leading them. 
As we said when we announced this deal, there are 3 primary strategic priorities fulfilled by this acquisition. It will deliver more content and the production capabilities and talent to produce even more. It will enhance our direct-to-consumer initiatives with platforms, technologies, brands and existing customer relationships to build on. And it will greatly diversify our businesses geographically. All 3 of these elements sync up perfectly with our own core strategies, and all 3 are designed to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. 
As that process moves forward, there are numerous new initiatives and projects underway, and I'd like to update you on a few of them. As you recall, some months ago, we announced our intention to develop and launch an ESPN direct-to-consumer business. This new business will launch sometime this spring, when we unveil a completely reconceived and redesigned ESPN app, which will deliver important new services and experiences to users. The changes will be dramatic, with more compelling visuals as well as an easy, intuitive interface and exceptional video and sound quality. Users will also enjoy an increasingly personalized experience as the app blends explicit choices with implicit behavior to curate a unique mix of specific, relevant content tailored to the taste of each individual user. This one app approach will deliver 3 main features. It will provide countless scores and highlights as well as podcasts and other sports information with a more user-friendly mobile interface. It will enable access to live streams of all ESPN networks, providing consumers or subscribers to multichannel packages. And it will feature our new ESPN Plus subscription service. Powered by BAMTech's proprietary technology, the service will offer a greatly expanded array of programs and live events for sports fans who want even more content as well as for fans interested in sports and events not currently featured on the main channels. 
This subscription service will feature thousands of additional live events, giving fans access to more leagues, more teams and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports as well as Grand Slam tennis, boxing, golf, rugby and cricket that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks. 
Additionally, ESPN Plus will feature the full library of ESPN films, including the highly acclaimed 30 for 30 documentary series, and we're also creating a robust slate of high-quality original content exclusively for this platform. 
As I noted earlier, we'll introduce this new app with its direct-to-consumer component this spring, and we're pricing ESPN Plus at $4.99 per month. It will be available on a variety of platforms at the time of launch, including iOS, Android, tvOS, Chromecast, with more to follow. We're very excited to bring this product to market, an opportunity created by our BAMTech acquisition. We plan to invest further in the direct-to-consumer feature, adding more live games and produce sports programming, along with even greater personalization, in the years ahead. Our upcoming Disney DTC service will also combine the full range of BAMTech's capabilities with some of the world's most popular IP to deliver a compelling consumer experience when it launches in late 2019. 
Turning to our studio. We're just days away from the highly anticipated release of Black Panther, which opens on February 16, and the buzz is palpable. At the moment, ticket presales are outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part by the phenomenal reaction to the premier last week. Marvel continues to defy expectations and redefine the superhero genre with each new release, constantly raising the bar with stories and characters that are fresh, compelling and spectacular. Black Panther is a great example, and we're thrilled with the attention and accolades it's receiving. It's exciting to see such tremendous enthusiasm for this film and its brilliant, diverse cast. 
We've got a strong pipeline of major releases to follow, including the March 9 debut of Disney's A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay and starting Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling. 
Our next Marvel movie in fiscal '18, Avengers: Infinity War, will showcase the largest collection of Marvel characters ever seen on screen when it opens May 4. And we'll release our second stand-alone Star Wars movie on May 25. The world got its first glimpse of Solo: A Star Wars Story this week, thanks to our Super Bowl ad, and we followed that with the release of the movie's first trailer yesterday. The reaction has been fantastic. 
Han Solo is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Star Wars universe, and there's clearly a lot of interest in his origin story.  
And the future of the Star Wars franchise just got even more exciting. In addition to next year's Episode IX and the trilogy Rian Johnson is developing for us, we just announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, creators of the epic Game of Thrones series, will write and produce a new series of original Star Wars films. 
Turning to Pixar. We released the Incredibles in 2004, and it remains one of the most popular Pixar films ever made. Its legions of fans around the world will be rewarded for their devotion and their patience when we release the long-awaited sequel, Incredibles 2, on June 15. Our release slate for the rest of 2018, 2019 and beyond is equally strong, and we'll talk more about those films on future calls. 
I also want to highlight our Parks and Resorts business, which continues to successfully leverage our incredible collection of IP to create and deliver an exceptional entertainment experience for millions of guests, as evidenced by their performance in Q1, all of which deepens our confidence in the significant investments we're making to grow the business around the world, including commissioning 3 new cruise ships to expand our award-winning fleet, adding Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, building Star Wars Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland and Disney World and preparing to incorporate more of our popular IP into Disneyland Paris. The investments we've made in IP, in addition to the numerous investments we've made across the world in our Parks and Resorts businesses, have driven dramatic growth over the last decade, and we're confident this trend will continue well into the future. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about the details of our results in the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, most notably a onetime $1.6 billion benefit associated with tax reform, earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were up 22% to $1.89. This $1.89 includes a $0.22 benefit from a lower federal tax rate in fiscal 2018. Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal tax rate is 24.5%. 
Turning to segment results. Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Operating income increased 21% due to growth at our domestic operations and Disneyland Paris. I'll note the year-over-year growth reflects the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Matthew and the dry-dock at Disney Cruise Line during Q1 last year. 
At our domestic operations, operating income was up 18% over prior year, driven by higher results at domestic Parks and Resorts and growth at Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 6% in the quarter as Pandora - The World of Avatar contributed to record attendance at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Walt Disney World overall, and Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT! contributed to higher attendance at Disneyland Resort. 
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was comparable to last year at 91%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year despite reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments. Booked rates are pacing up 13%, which reflects our strategy of improving the guest experience through better load-balancing of attendance throughout the year as well as the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year, whereas the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in Q3 last year. 
We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period will shift approximately $35 million in operating income from Q3 to Q2. This benefit will be partially offset by the impact of a 14-day dry-dock of the Disney Magic, which will adversely affect Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. 
I'll also note, Disneyland Paris continued to benefit from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration, which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. The resort set a new Q1 record in revenue and has now been profitable for the last 3 quarters, so we are very pleased with the progress we're making there. 
Total segment operating income margin was 26.1%, up 170 basis points compared to Q1 last year and represents the highest quarterly margin for the segment since 2004, when we began consolidating our international parks. 
At Media Networks, operating income declined during the first quarter primarily due to lower results at Broadcasting and lower equity income. At Broadcasting, we continue to see nice double-digit growth in affiliate revenue. However, that was more than offset by lower advertising revenue, higher programming cost and lower operating income from program sales. The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower political advertising at our owned stations and lower ad revenue at the ABC Network, where higher rates were offset by a decline in impressions.  Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income at A+E Television Networks, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from our investment in BAMTech. I'll note that due to our increased stake in BAMTech, BAMTech's results are now consolidated within Cable Networks. 
At Cable, growth at Disney Channels and Freeform was offset by losses at BAMTech and lower results at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming expense was primarily driven by the timing of the 2 College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games, which shifted out of Q1 this year into Q2, partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 11% in the quarter, reflecting a decrease in impressions and lower rates, which were adversely impacted by the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal ballgames. 
Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's 6 bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year, the 2 semifinal games aired during the second quarter. We estimate Q1 ad revenue was down 7%, excluding the impact of the 2 semifinal bowl games shifting into Q2 this year. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales pacing is comparable to last year and reflects the timing benefit of the 2 semifinal ballgames. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
At the studio, first quarter results were modestly lower compared to last year as growth in theatrical distribution was offset by lower operating income in our home entertainment and television distribution businesses. Our theatrical business had another solid quarter due to the strong performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is our third Star Wars film, and through today, these 3 films have collectively generated over $4.4 billion in global box office. 
Lower home entertainment operating income reflects lower unit sales, driven by the strong performance of Finding Dory last year compared to Cars 3 in Q1 this year. Lower television distribution results were primarily due to a decrease in pay television, driven by the domestic availability of 2 key titles in Q1 last year, Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, compared to one key title, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, in Q1 this year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by growth in our games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 12.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 17.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. 
Earlier, I quantified 2 impacts of tax reform to our Q1 results: first, the $1.6 billion onetime net benefit, driven primarily by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability; and second, a $0.22 benefit in the quarter due to the lower statutory rate. As I mentioned earlier, our applicable federal statutory tax rate is 24.5% for fiscal 2018. For future years, the federal tax rate will be 21%. In recent years, our effective tax rate has closely mirrored the statutory rate, and we continue to expect that to be the case going forward. 
As we look to the second quarter, there are a few factors I'd like to highlight that will influence Q2 comparisons. We expect cable expense growth to be up mid-teens, reflecting the consolidation of BAMTech and higher programming expenses at ESPN primarily due to the timing of the College Football semifinal games. There is no change in our full year cable expense growth forecast of high single digits, driven by BAMTech, and up low single digits on a comparable basis. 
At Broadcasting, results will reflect a $55 million decline in operating income from program sales due largely to the timing of the domestic SVOD in international sales. 
At the studio, I'll remind you we had a very strong second quarter last year due to the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. We also have 2 releases this quarter versus 1 in the prior year, which will drive higher marketing expenses. So while we are excited about the release of Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time, these factors create a very difficult comparison at Studio Entertainment. 
And finally, last month, we announced a onetime bonus to 125,000 cast members. We expect roughly half of the forecasted expense or about $55 million to fall in the second quarter, with roughly $40 million recorded at Parks and Resorts. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

And so the app that we are launching sometime this spring, we didn't give a specific date, will be a completely new app. The app itself will have 3 primary features, as I've been saying, but I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down on a couple of them. The first is the obvious. It will have tons of scores and highlights and news stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use BAMTech engine, data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization/customization perspective that, that can provide. That will, by the way, be evidenced in both video as well as in the, basically, the written word that's presented, the stories that are presented, customizable, obviously, by teams, by locations, by general interest. But also, the, basically, machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more. The second feature is live streaming of the networks themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so if you are a subscriber to an existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that to stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously, the app will provide that. The watch app today does that, but you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I AirPlay. I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television. And then, of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature. We're actually calling it ESPN Plus because it's offering an incremental thousands of hours of live sports programming, basically, to the ESPN experience. And then in addition to that, that will be the home of the 30 for 30 series. The entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. We'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app. So it's a 3-in-1, completely new experience, new technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but if anything points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it will be this app and the experience that it provides."

And so it will power a number of different sort of go-to-consumer experiences. And I can't really say what we will do post regulatory approval on the Fox acquisition. We're looking at a number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure. Clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. When I mean conformity, I just mean basically being more efficient, being more consistent and using basically our best talent and the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible. In terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management, to some extent, some sales as well because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences but also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility. On the Lucasfilm question you asked of Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars-based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. So what they have an idea about, a number of films, and at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They're focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there. We are developing not just one but a few Star Wars series specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. We've mentioned that, and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us. But because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we're pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating not just Star Wars but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find that the level of talent that will be on the, if you call it, television front will be rather significant as well."

We broke ground on that, I think, actually, before we actually opened Shanghai. And other one is being built in Orlando, and that will be opened some point later this year, but we have not announced the date. And they are both large lands. They're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building. I'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that, that franchise is still quite popular, we're making a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019. We feel good about it. They're large in size, 10 acres, I'm being told, versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they're not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that. And they'll have very, very distinct IP from Toy Story. So in other words, people will know exactly what the experience is going to be. We basically immerse you in a toy world. Your first question, I think the way to look at the revenue opportunities particularly as it relates to production is to consider the fact that what we're buying here is significant production capabilities and, with that, the talent to produce on our behalf. The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tentpole movie direction but also in the, well, call it, specialty movie direction. The Fox 2000 and Fox Searchlight businesses as a for instance. And there's also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences. In addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, 2 very specific examples of that, as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX. And so we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and, obviously, production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really -- and this, I think, needs to be considered on a global basis. So this, obviously, is application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms."

We didn't note it, but Shanghai has had just a great year, including some days where they've just had unbelievable records, well over 60,000, I think 65,000, 68,000 in attendance on one day in October. And the comparisons to a year ago are relatively similar because we've had just a great year consistently. It was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a 3-tier pricing strategy, and that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward, provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26, and so that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity.

And you've talked about a couple of billion synergies with the transaction. And then Bob, you said you're looking to create and grow a global direct-to-consumer business, and your biggest competitor there just continues to increase the amount of cash they're spending on original content. So when we think about some of the incremental cash that you're going to have at hand, how do you think about -- how many billions of that you need to put back into these direct-to-consumer enterprises to be competitive and to grow at the global scale you want to be at?"

We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks. Actually, we got more aggressive in the last few years. A",485,"Well, in the earlier interview that I did on CNBC, I was asked a similar question. We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks. Actually, we got more aggressive in the last few years. And then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth, Theme Parks being a great example of that with the expansion that we've talked about, not just, by the way, Shanghai but the expansion of every park and resort around the world and then the commitment to build 3 new cruise ships. And that's all benefited us greatly. As we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar blend, except, as I said earlier, too, with the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, I think you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time. In terms of how we might allocate the other capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth, and in this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and, essentially, absorbing those assets, we'll probably -- I'm not likely to say something specific. What we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer product, which is not in the market and you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that it will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product, of course, but not necessarily to go in the volume direction, say, that Netflix has gone because we have this unique brand proposition. And the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volumes. Not to suggest that we're going to be low because we obviously are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective. But when you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel-branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases, using very well-known IP. We're developing a Monsters series. We're developing a High School Musical series. We're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few. That will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands."

They have been increasing not only the amount of product that they've licensed but the amount of products that they produce and with some considerable success, Handmaid's Tale being one of the most recent example of that. So they're ramping up their volume. They're also packaging the subscription service with a multi-subscription SVOD service with a multichannel service, and that product is doing quite well. I know they mentioned that they had in excess of 17 million subs, and we're not going to update that. We'll leave it to their team if and when they choose to do so. But that will give them the ability to continue to increase volume by going into market with a slightly different set of products, the channels being the differentiator. There's an opportunity, obviously, when we own more production capability to create more for those platforms, but we don't have anything specific to address at this point."

The contracts end on the end of the period, which should be 12/31, and our quarter ended on December 30. So there's a shift from Q1 into Q2, which impacted their operating income this quarter. Also, I just would mention, for 2Q, when you're looking at it, we did have the benefit of some licensee  settlements that we called out in our press release last year, so that's going to be a comparability factor in 2Q. But getting back to your other question on the business overall, for the balance of the year, we're very confident in our film slate and the associated IP and how it will impact our Consumer Products business. We have Star Wars: The Last Jedi out now. We'll have Solo out in the spring. We have 4 movies: Thor, which has already come out; the other 3, Black Panther, Avengers and Ant-Man and the Wasp.

We're very pleased with our results in Q2 especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses. Our Parks continue to drive growth through operational excellence and by effectively leveraging our extraordinary content. 
As an example, I just got back from opening our new Toy Story Land in Shanghai Disneyland, and I'm happy to report that our first major addition to the park was met with strong reviews and excitement. We're thrilled with the reaction and enthusiasm generated by the new land bodes well for future expansion. 
Toy Story Land also opens in Orlando next month. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will open in both Disneyland and Disney World by the end of calendar 2019, and there's a lot more expansion underway in our Parks and Resorts around the world. 
Turning to our Studio. It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to adequately express the tremendous work that team is doing. It's clear from the recent results as well as from the slate ahead that our Studio has and will continue to raise the bar in terms of both creative and commercial success. 
The incredible performance of Marvel's Black Panther is just one of many examples. This groundbreaking movie opened to huge claim and record-breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age old industry myths. With more than $1.3 billion in box office to-date, Black Panther makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk-taking and the value of inclusion. We're product this movie on so many levels. It speaks volumes about great innovative storytelling, the power of new perspectives and unrivaled creativity. 
We follow the phenomenal success of Black Panther with another Marvel masterpiece, Avengers: Infinity War, which broke domestic and global records to become the largest movie opening in history. With this latest success, our studio has delivered 9 of the top 10 biggest domestic box office openings of all time, all of them released in the last 6 years. Infinity War crossed $1 billion at the box office faster than any film ever released, with worldwide box office of $1.2 billion to-date before it is even opened in China. 
Judging from strong ticket pre-sales and anticipation I saw during my recent visit, Chinese audiences are eager to see this movie, too. There are now 19 movies in the Marvel cinematic universe with a combined box office of more than $16 billion and an average box office of $845 million per film. The MCU is, by far, the most lucrative box office franchise of all time, creating an incredible pipeline of proven branded IP that drives significant opportunity across our entire organization. 
The rest of our studio slate is just as impressive, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is generating a lot of interest in strong buzz ahead of its memorial day weekend opening. 
We'll follow that by releasing a dozen big movies over the next 18 months, including Incredibles 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, the Lion King, Frozen 2 and Star Wars Episode IX. 
Looking at this collection gives you a real sense of what's in store when we launch our Disney branded direct-to-consumer service in late 2019. 
We're creating a truly unique value proposition for consumers, a service focused on quality over quantity featuring film and television products from our foremost collection of family-oriented brands. Our content strategy includes a rich mix of beloved classics, recent releases and new content being created exclusively for the new platform by Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. We'll share more details in the coming months, including the robust slate of original movies, series and other content currently being developed. 
The deeper we delve into the possibilities of this platform, the more excited we are by its potential to drive value and we're more confident than ever that we're creating an exceptional expert entertainment experience that consumers will find very appealing. 
On the sports front, we are very encouraged by the reaction to our ESPN Plus service, which launched just about a month ago. The reviews have been strong and the response of sports fans has been enthusiastic. 
And the new deal we announced this morning will add a rich slate of UFC content to the mix, including live events and original content creating exclusively for ESPN Plus. 
As we've said before, our incomparable collection of strong brands recognize the respect of the world over puts us in great position to lead the way when it comes to building the real relationships with consumers that will define the future of media. Our recent reorganization reflects our determination to effectively capitalize on a rapidly changing landscape, increasingly defined by transformative technology and evolving consumer expectations. 
Our Studio and Media Networks are content engines for the entire company, and we're maximizing their value by combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content that people around the world want most with far more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before. 
We're also merging consumer products and Parks and Resorts together, combining strategy and resources to create extraordinary experiences and products that bring out stories and characters to live for consumers inside our parks and home and beyond. We believe this new structure positions our businesses for the future, creating a more effective global framework to serve consumers worldwide, promote growth and maximize shareholder value. 
It brings our operations an even closer alignment with our long-term strategy, creating high quality content, innovative use of technology and global expansion, including robust direct-to-consumer distribution. 
If you recall when we announced the Fox deal, we noted that it would serve the same strategic priorities. And for this reason, we're confident the assets we're in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved. We're still deep in the regulatory process, so I can't share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets as part of our ongoing strategy to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss details of our Q2 results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"
191564,557707807,1454512,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 08, 2018",2018-05-08,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results t",1163,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results this quarter reflects strength in our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments. 
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 13% and operating income was up 27%, driven by growth at Our Domestic and international Parks and Resorts. I'll note that second quarter results reflect the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday period, whereas, the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in the third quarter last year. 
We estimate the timing of Easter drove a $47 million benefit to operating income. This benefit was partially offset by the adverse impact of a 14-day Dry Dock of the Disney Magic, which reduced Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. 
The segment delivered another quarter of stellar results with revenue and operating income setting new Q2 records even after taking into account the net impact of these 2 items. 
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to higher guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending was up 6% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 12% and occupancy was up about 2 percentage points to 90%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 5% in the quarter and reflects about 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday. 
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4% compared to prior year, reflecting reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishment and the impact of only 1 week of the Easter holiday period in the third quarter compared to 2 weeks last year. Booked rates are pacing up 8%. 
At our international Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was due to increases at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resorts. 
At Disneyland Paris, the resort's 25th anniversary celebration continue to drive higher guest spending, attendance and hotel occupancy. 
Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to increases in occupied room nights and attendance. At Shanghai Disney Resort, unfavorable weather early in the quarter resulted in lower attendance, which drove a decrease in operating income compared to prior year. However, we saw a nice recovery starting in March and expect this positive trend to continue given the recent launch of Toy Story Land. 
Total segment operating income margin was up 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Our studio had another phenomenal quarter. Operating income was up 29% to $847 million, setting a new second quarter record. Growth in operating income was due to increases in our Theatrical and Home Entertainment businesses and growth in  TV/SVOD distribution. We had expected Q2 theatrical results to face a comparability challenge given the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carry over performance of Rogue One and Moana during the second quarter last year. However, as Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Black Panther, which surpassed our expectations and drove a meaningful increase in our worldwide theatrical results. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income decreased in the second quarter due to lower equity income and a decline at cable. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu, partially offset by higher income from our investment in A+E. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by a continued investment in programming and marketing, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Cable operating income was lower in the quarter due to losses at BAMTech, and to a lesser extent, lower results at Freeform and ESPN. I'll remind you that BAMTech's results last year were reflected in equity in the income of investees are now reported as part of our cable results do to our acquisition of a controlling stake last year. The operating loss of BAMTech for the second quarter reflects ongoing investment in the technology platform, including cost associated with ESPN Plus. 
We now expect BAMTech's results to have an adverse impact on Media Networks fiscal 2018 operating income of $180 million compared to the prior year. This is $50 million [ worse ] than our previous estimate due primarily to increased investment in ESPN Plus. 
I'll also note that about $100 million of the full year impact is expected during the third quarter. 
At ESPN, higher programming expenses more than offset growth in affiliate and advertising revenues. The increase in programming spend was driven by the timing of both the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl game and the start of the Major League Baseball season and contractual rate increases for other college sports and MBA programming. Like last year, ESPN aired three of the New York Bowl Games during the second quarter. However, the mix of games included the 2 semifinal games in Q2 this year, whereas, the semifinal games aired in the first quarter last year. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 3% in the quarter due to higher rates, which benefited from the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. We estimate the shift of the 2 semifinal ball games into Q2 this year had a positive impact of about 5 percentage points on ad revenue growth in the second quarter. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 1% compared to prior year. 
Broadcasting results were comparable to Q2 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. Lower income from program sales and higher network programming and marketing expenses. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher rates. Lower income from program sales primarily reflects higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year compared to this year. 
Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 27% above upfront levels. 
Total Media Network's affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
While the impact of subscriber declines on affiliate revenue growth still rounds to 3 points, I'll note that this is the third consecutive quarter we've seen modest deceleration in the rate of net subscriber declines. 
And finally, consumer product in Interactive Media results were lower in the quarter as higher licensing income was more than offset by lower comparable store sales in our retail business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 
During second quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we repurchased 31.3 million shares for approximately $3.2 billion. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

Can you talk about the run way ahead for that business, whether it's sort of pricing power, capacity at the hotels. You mentioned or Christine mentioned 90% occupancy, the ability to drive additional operating leverage, I think, your margins, I think, they are at all-time highs. When you look out over the next 3 to 4 years, assuming the economy is okay, can you just talk about the drivers of continued growth at the levels we've gotten accustomed to? And on the digital front, I don't know if you can answer this, but I thought I'd take a stab. You announced your digital pivot last year ahead of the Fox announcement. So maybe you could talk about how essential or not Fox and its associated global assets are to your digital strategy as you look out over time?"

The first question we think that there's ample room for expansion. It will come from multiple directions. One, manage expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously, the bottom line.

One, manage expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously, the bottom line. One will come from expansion. As you know, we are building out all of our parks, including the Toy Story Land, it's about to open in Florida, the one that just opened in Shanghai, the cruise ships, the 2 Star Wars Lands, multiple hotels around the world, new lands in places like Paris and Tokyo and I can go on, so that's one. Two, we believe, that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth, and that's, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand it is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience. And the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that, that opportunity exists. So we feel overall great about the future of this business, particularly, by the way, as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that. On the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the two new digital products, the ESPN Plus product and the Disney product well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition. On the sports front, the regional sports networks and then on the Disney front, we think there's some great opportunities for Nat Geo and some of the other Fox properties to be part of the Disney family direct-to-consumer proposition, but that largely is going to be anchored by Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, so not dependent at all on the assets that we're buying from Fox. Of course, we end up in this acquisition owning 60% of Hulu, and it is our intention to continue to fuel Hulu with more original programming. And much of that original programming will come from the assets of both Disney and Fox. Think FX as one example, searchlight is another, it's using some of the other Fox's intellectual property. But I'd say when we announced a year ago, we were not talking about Hulu, we were talking about these two new properties. And again,neither is dependent upon but stands to benefit from the Fox acquisition."

A number of people have signed up, obviously, for the trial and our conversion rates have been good so far.

There's always opportunity to get better, and that's what we'll do. But basically, I give it a so far, so good. I watched -- not on a WiFi connection, but I watched the other day a live Yankee game, basically while I was sitting in my car, the quality was fantastic. And I found that as customizing with my favorite teams, et cetera and so on that it's serving me and my sports interest quite well and I assume that's the case with our consumers. We did announce today the acquisition of the UFC events starting in 2019 for 5 years. That's a start. We intend to continue to invest in buying product that is original specific for the app, both live sports and non-live sports. We've also moved some product over there and put some library products over there, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to fuel that experience with product you don't get to see on the linear network. Just, for instance, we've launched the equivalent of a short SportsCenter that Scott Van Pelt is doing that will be available on a daily basis. So there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to continue to invest. On the Disney front, we're in right now the process of creating a lot of original content. We're launching late night 2019. That's to wait for some of our movie output to become available once the Netflix deal expires and also to give us an opportunity to ramp up some of the original content that we're creating for. We've said a few times we're going to get more specific about that as we get closer, but we're producing right now content for -- original content that is Pixar-branded, Marvel-branded and Disney-branded, and we are feeling quite good about the direction that we're headed there. In the Disney case, we're looking for quality over quantity. We're not looking for essentially massive amounts of content, we are looking for high quality content utilizing those brands and the franchisee and characters that fall under those brands. Right now, I feel good about both."

We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and they may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets would love us to put the Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets and consider all the factors that we typically have consider, which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that -- and then inevitably for us building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look. On the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized and typically you find Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes global means of managing customers, data management, billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it, essentially, one technology. And I then thought, but if we were -- all of these assets to come together today from Day 1 in effect -- on Day 1 without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition because it made sense once we buy Fox, it seem to make sense even before that. So what we basically did is we have 3 primary content divisions. One, I'll call Media Networks or television; another one will be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio, the Fox assets we'll plug into all 3 of those. Then there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in inefficiencies, really, between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts. And then we looked at creating essentially a global platform or distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses but would then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring. And it seemed to make sense that international become part of that, part because it's part of the acquisition, there are 2 big platform, Sky and Star that are part of that. And so if this acquisition happens, it seems to make sense that the international assets and the global platform assets are in one business. So there's just a lot of efficiencies and managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world, it's our intention to create great user experience in an efficient way, not only of our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. It really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is continuous accompany to invest and then to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern, more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it and diversify the company internationally."

We're very pleased with our results in Q2, especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses.

We're very pleased with our results in Q2, especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses. Our Parks continue to drive growth through operational excellence and by effectively leveraging our extraordinary content. As an example, I just got back from opening our new Toy Story Land in Shanghai Disneyland, and I'm happy to report that our first major addition to the park was met with strong reviews and excitement. We're thrilled with the reaction and enthusiasm generated by the new land bodes well for future expansion.
Toy Story Land also opens in Orlando next month. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will open in both Disneyland and Disney World by the end of calendar 2019, and there's a lot more expansion underway in our Parks and Resorts around the world.
Turning to our Studio. It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to adequately express the tremendous work that team is doing. It's clear from the recent results as well as from the slate ahead that our Studio has and will continue to raise the bar in terms of both creative and commercial success.
The incredible performance of Marvel's Black Panther is just one of many examples. This groundbreaking movie opened to huge claim and record-breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age old industry myths. With more than $1.3 billion in box office to-date, Black Panther makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk-taking and the value of inclusion. We're proud of this movie on so many levels. It speaks values about great innovative storytelling, the power of new perspectives and unbridled creativity.
We followed the phenomenal success of Black Panther with another Marvel masterpiece, Avengers: Infinity War, which broke domestic and global records to become the largest movie opening in history. With this latest success, our studio has delivered 9 of the top 10 biggest domestic box office openings of all time, all of them released in the last 6 years. Infinity War crossed $1 billion of the box office faster than any film ever released, with worldwide box office of $1.2 billion to-date before it is even opened in China.
Judging from strong ticket pre-sales and anticipation I saw during my recent visit, Chinese audiences are eager to see this movie, too. There are now 19 movies in the Marvel cinematic universe with a combined box office of more than $16 billion and an average box office of $845 million per film. The MCU is, by far, the most lucrative box office franchise of all time, creating an incredible pipeline of proven branded IP that drives significant opportunity across our entire organization.
The rest of our Studio slate is just as impressive, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is generating a lot of interest and strong buzz ahead of its Memorial Day weekend opening. We'll follow that by releasing a dozen big movies over the next 18 months, including Incredibles 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Frozen 2 and Star Wars Episode IX.
Looking at this collection gives you a real sense of what's in store when we launched our Disney branded direct-to-consumer service in late 2019. We're creating a truly unique value proposition for consumers, a service focused on quality over quantity, featuring film and television products from our foremost collection of family-oriented brands. Our content strategy includes a rich mix of beloved classics, recent releases and new content being created exclusively for the new platform by Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. We'll share more details in the coming months, including the robust slate of original movies, series and other content currently being developed.
The deeper we delve into the possibilities of this platform, the more excited we are by its potential to drive value and we're more confident than ever that we're creating an exceptional expert entertainment experience that consumers will find very appealing.
On the sports front, we're very encouraged by the reaction to our ESPN Plus service, which launched just about a month ago. The reviews have been strong and the response of sports fans has been enthusiastic. And the new deal we announced this morning will add a rich slate of UFC content to the mix, including live events and original content creating exclusively for ESPN Plus. 
As we've said before, our incomparable collection of strong brands recognized and respected the world over puts us in great position to lead the way when it comes to building the direct relationships with consumers that will define the future of media. Our recent reorganization reflects our determination to effectively capitalize on a rapidly changing landscape increasingly defined by transformative technology and evolving consumer expectations.
Our Studio and Media Networks are content engines for the entire company, and we're maximizing their value by combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content that people around the world want most, with far more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before.
We're also merging Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts together, combining strategy and resources to create extraordinary experiences and products that bring our stories and characters to life for consumers inside our parks, at home and beyond. We believe this new structure positions our businesses for the future, creating a more effective global framework to serve consumers worldwide, promote growth and maximize shareholder value.
It brings our operations into even closer alignment with our long-term strategy, creating high quality content, innovative use of technology and global expansion, including robust direct-to-consumer distribution.
If you recall when we announced the Fox deal, we noted that it would serve these same strategic priorities. And for this reason, we are confident the assets we're in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved. We're still deep in the regulatory process so I can't share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets as part of our ongoing strategy to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace.
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss details of our Q2 results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"
191564,557707807,1454845,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 08, 2018",2018-05-08,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results t",1165,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results this quarter reflects strength in our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments.
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 13% and operating income was up 27%, driven by growth at our domestic and international Parks and Resorts. I'll note that second quarter results reflect the benefit of 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas, the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in the third quarter last year. 
We estimate the timing of Easter drove a $47 million benefit to operating income. This benefit was partially offset by the adverse impact of a 14-day dry dock of the Disney Magic, which reduced Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. The segment delivered another quarter of stellar results with revenue and operating income setting new Q2 records even after taking into account the net impact of these 2 items.
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to higher guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending was up 6% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 12% and occupancy was up about 2 percentage points to 90%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 5% in the quarter and reflects about a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4% compared to prior year, reflecting reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishment and the impact of only 1 week of the Easter holiday period in the third quarter compared to 2 weeks last year. Booked rates are pacing up 8%.
At our international Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was due to increases at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At Disneyland Paris, the resort's 25th anniversary celebration continued to drive higher guest spending, attendance and hotel occupancy. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to increases in occupied room nights and attendance. At Shanghai Disney Resort, unfavorable weather early in the quarter resulted in lower attendance, which drove a decrease in operating income compared to prior year. However, we saw a nice recovery starting in March and expect this positive trend to continue given the recent launch of Toy Story Land.
Total segment operating income margin was up 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Our studio had another phenomenal quarter. Operating income was up 29% to $847 million, setting a new second quarter record. Growth in operating income was due to increases in our Theatrical and home entertainment businesses and growth in TV/SVOD distribution. We had expected Q2 theatrical results to face a comparability challenge given the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carry over performance of Rogue One and Moana during the second quarter last year. However, as Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Black Panther, which surpassed our expectations and drove a meaningful increase in our worldwide theatrical results.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income decreased in the second quarter due to lower equity income and a decline at cable. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu, partially offset by higher income from our investment in A+E. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by a continued investment in programming and marketing, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Cable operating income was lower in the quarter due to losses at BAMTech, and to a lesser extent, lower results at Freeform and ESPN. I'll remind you that BAMTech's results last year were reflected in equity in the income of investees but are now reported as part of our cable results do to our acquisition of a controlling stake last year. The operating loss of BAMTech for the second quarter reflects ongoing investment in its technology platform, including cost associated with ESPN Plus. We now expect BAMTech's results to have an adverse impact on Media Networks' fiscal 2018 operating income of $180 million compared to the prior year. This is $50 million worse than our previous estimate due primarily to increased investment in ESPN Plus. I'll also note that about $100 million of the full year impact is expected during the third quarter.
At ESPN, higher programming expenses more than offset growth in affiliate and advertising revenues. The increase in programming spend was driven by the timing of both the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl game and the start of the Major League Baseball season and contractual rate increases for other college sports and MBA programming. Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter. However, the mix of games included the 2 semifinal games in Q2 this year, whereas, the semifinal games aired in the first quarter last year.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 3% in the quarter due to higher rates, which benefited from the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. We estimate the shift of the 2 semifinal ball games into Q2 this year had a positive impact of about 5 percentage points on ad revenue growth in the second quarter. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 1% compared to prior year.
Broadcasting results were comparable to Q2 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue, lower income from program sales and higher network programming and marketing expenses. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher rates. Lower income from program sales primarily reflects higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year compared to this year. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 27% above upfront levels.
Total Media Network's affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.
While the impact of subscriber declines on affiliate revenue growth still rounds to 3 points, I'll note that this is the third consecutive quarter we've seen modest deceleration in the rate of net subscriber declines. 
And finally, Consumer Product and Interactive Media results were lower in the quarter as higher licensing income was more than offset by lower comparable store sales in our retail business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
During second quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we repurchased 31.3 million shares for approximately $3.2 billion.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

Can you talk about the run way ahead for that business, whether it's sort of pricing power, capacity at the hotels. You mentioned -- or Christine mentioned 90% occupancy. The ability to drive additional operating leverage. I think your margins are -- I think, they're at all-time highs. When you look out over the next 3 to 4 years, assuming the economy is okay, can you just talk about the drivers of continued growth at the levels we've gotten accustomed to? And on the digital front, I don't know if you can answer this, but I thought I'd take a stab. You announced your digital pivot last year ahead of the Fox announcement. So maybe you could talk about how essential or not Fox and its associated global assets are to your digital strategy as you look out over time?"

One, I mean, expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously, the bottom line. One will come from expansion. As you know, we are building out all of our parks, including the Toy Story Land that's about to open in Florida, the one that just opened in Shanghai, the cruise ships, the 2 Star Wars Lands, multiple hotels around the world, new lands in places like Paris and Tokyo and I could go on. So that's one. Two, we believe, that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth, and that's, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand it is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience. And the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that, that opportunity exists. So we feel, overall, great about the future of this business, particularly, by the way, as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that. On the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the 2 new digital products, the ESPN Plus product and the Disney product well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition. On the sports front, the regional sports networks and then on the Disney front, we think there's some great opportunities for Nat Geo and some of the other Fox properties to be part of the Disney family direct-to-consumer proposition, but that largely is going to be anchored by Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, so not dependent at all on the assets that we're buying from Fox. Of course, we end up in this acquisition owning 60% of Hulu, and it is our intention to continue to fuel Hulu with more original programming. And much of that original programming will come from the assets of both Disney and Fox. Think FX as one example, Searchlight is another, us using some of the other Fox's intellectual property. But I'd say when we announced a year ago, we were not talking about Hulu, we were talking about these 2 new properties. And again, neither is dependent upon, but stands to benefit from the Fox acquisition."

There's always opportunity to get better, and that's what we'll do. But basically, I give it a so far, so good. I watched -- not on a WiFi connection, but I watched the other day a live Yankee game, basically while I was sitting in my car, and was -- the quality was fantastic. And I found that as I've customized it with my favorite teams, et cetera and so on, that it's serving me and my sports interest quite well and I assume that's the case with our consumers. We did announce today the acquisition of the UFC events starting in 2019 for 5 years. That's a start. We intend to continue to invest in buying product that is original, whether that is specific for the app, both live sports and non-live sports. We've also moved some product over there and put some library products over there, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to fuel that experience with product you don't get to see on the linear network. Just, for instance, we've launched the equivalent of a short SportsCenter that Scott Van Pelt is doing that will be available on a daily basis. So there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to continue to invest. On the Disney front, we're in right now the process of creating a lot of original content. We're launching [ Late Night 2019 ]. That's to wait for some of our movie output to become available once the Netflix deal expires and also to give us an opportunity to ramp up some of the original content that we're creating for it. And we've said a few times we're going to get more specific about that as we get closer, but we're producing right now content for -- original content that is Pixar-branded, Marvel-branded, Star Wars-branded and Disney-branded, and we are feeling quite good about the direction that we're headed there. In the Disney case, we're looking for quality over quantity. We're not looking for essentially massive amounts of content, we're looking for high quality content utilizing those brands and the franchisee and characters that fall under those brands. Right now, I feel good about both."

The first one is, I wanted to hear a bit about the reorg you, guys, put through in March, where you shifted advertising, content sales, international to 1 division. And what are we trying to gain by doing that? And then secondly, when we think about what you've done in China in putting a park near to kind of build awareness for the Disney brand. As you move to more of a global OTT strategy, would you ever consider building parks in other parts of the world as kind of a brand beacon for just the overall interest in Disney's products?"

We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and there may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets who would love us to put the Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets and consider all the factors that we typically have to consider, which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that there's -- in that -- an inevitably to us of building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look. On the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized. And you typically find Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes a global means of managing customers, data management, billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it, essentially, one technology. And I then thought, but if we were to -- if all these assets were to come together today from Day 1 in effect -- on Day 1 without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition because, if it made sense, once we buy Fox, it seem to make sense even before that. So what we basically did is we have 3 primary content divisions. One, I'll call Media Networks or television; another one will be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio, the Fox assets would plug into all 3 of those. Then, there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in inefficiencies, really, between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts. And then we looked at creating essentially a global platform or distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses but then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring. And it seemed to make sense that international become part of that, part because as part of the acquisition, there are 2 big platforms, Sky and Star, that are part of that. And so if this acquisition happens, it seemed to make sense that the international assets and, I'll call, the global platform assets are in one business. And so there's just a lot of efficiencies in managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world, it's our intention to create a great user experience and an efficient way, not only of our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. And the -- it really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is to continue as a company to invest and to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern, more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it and diversify the company internationally."

We're confident that with the 7,000-some-odd characters that's a part of the Marvel Universe, that there's plenty stories and characters to mine from and have some great ideas. I'm guessing that we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that. The goal, of course, was for the fourth Avengers series to have a significant conclusion. But given the popularity of the characters and given the popularity of the franchise, I don't think people should conclude that there'll never be another Avengers movie.

We have primarily resorted to using time and marketing opportunity on the ESPN platforms, including the channels, the magazine, the websites and the existing app. ESPN digital is the most popular sports digital product out there. It dwarves some of the competition, and that gave us ample opportunity to promote, basically, what is a new app experience. So the marketing costs are modest. There's some investment and additional programming prior to launch, but we made more investment with the announcement of UFC. That doesn't come until 2019, and we're going to continue to invest in product to make ESPN Plus a real digital sports marketplace. We're not going to give the specifics about the size of the Toy Story Land, but it marked a substantial increase or in expansion of that park, building a new land. It's not as large, by the way, as the Toy Story Land that we're opening this summer in Orlando, but having been there last week, it's sizable in nature, it's got some great attractions, retail and dining experiences.

We're very pleased with our results in Q2, especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses. Our Parks continue to drive growth through operational excellence and by effectively leveraging our extraordinary content. As an example, I just got back from opening our new Toy Story Land in Shanghai Disneyland, and I'm happy to report that our first major addition to the park was met with strong reviews and great excitement. We're thrilled with the reaction and enthusiasm generated by the new land bodes well for future expansion.
Toy Story Land also opens in Orlando next month. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will open in both Disneyland and Disney World by the end of calendar 2019, and there's a lot more expansion underway in our Parks and Resorts around the world.
Turning to our Studio. It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to adequately express the tremendous work that team is doing. It's clear from the recent results as well as from the slate ahead that our Studio has and will continue to raise the bar in terms of both creative and commercial success.
The incredible performance of Marvel's Black Panther is just one of many examples. This groundbreaking movie opened to huge claim and record-breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age old industry myths. With more than $1.3 billion in box office to-date, Black Panther makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk-taking and the value of inclusion. We're proud of this movie on so many levels. It speaks values about great innovative storytelling, the power of new perspectives and unbridled creativity.
We followed the phenomenal success of Black Panther with another Marvel masterpiece, Avengers: Infinity War, which broke domestic and global records to become the largest movie opening in history. With this latest success, our studio has delivered 9 of the top 10 biggest domestic box office openings of all time, all of them released in the last 6 years. Infinity War crossed $1 billion of the box office faster than any film ever released, with worldwide box office of $1.2 billion to-date before it is even opened in China.
Judging from strong ticket pre-sales and anticipation I saw during my recent visit, Chinese audiences are eager to see this movie, too. There are now 19 movies in the Marvel cinematic universe with a combined box office of more than $16 billion and an average box office of $845 million per film. The MCU is, by far, the most lucrative box office franchise of all time, creating an incredible pipeline of proven branded IP that drives significant opportunity across our entire organization.
The rest of our Studio slate is just as impressive, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is generating a lot of interest and strong buzz ahead of its Memorial Day weekend opening. We'll follow that by releasing a dozen big movies over the next 18 months, including Incredibles 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Frozen 2 and Star Wars Episode IX.
Looking at this collection gives you a real sense of what's in store when we launched our Disney branded direct-to-consumer service in late 2019. We're creating a truly unique value proposition for consumers, a service focused on quality over quantity, featuring film and television products from our foremost collection of family-oriented brands. Our content strategy includes a rich mix of beloved classics, recent releases and new content being created exclusively for the new platform by Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. We'll share more details in the coming months, including the robust slate of original movies, series and other content currently being developed.
The deeper we delve into the possibilities of this platform, the more excited we are by its potential to drive value and we're more confident than ever that we're creating an exceptional expert entertainment experience that consumers will find very appealing.
On the sports front, we're very encouraged by the reaction to our ESPN Plus service, which launched just about a month ago. The reviews have been strong and the response of sports fans has been enthusiastic. And the new deal we announced this morning will add a rich slate of UFC content to the mix, including live events and original content creating exclusively for ESPN Plus. 
As we've said before, our incomparable collection of strong brands recognized and respected the world over puts us in great position to lead the way when it comes to building the direct relationships with consumers that will define the future of media. Our recent reorganization reflects our determination to effectively capitalize on a rapidly changing landscape increasingly defined by transformative technology and evolving consumer expectations.
Our Studio and Media Networks are content engines for the entire company, and we're maximizing their value by combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content that people around the world want most, with far more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before.
We're also merging Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts together, combining strategy and resources to create extraordinary experiences and products that bring our stories and characters to life for consumers inside our parks, at home and beyond. We believe this new structure positions our businesses for the future, creating a more effective global framework to serve consumers worldwide, promote growth and maximize shareholder value.
It brings our operations into even closer alignment with our long-term strategy, creating high quality content, innovative use of technology and global expansion, including robust direct-to-consumer distribution.
If you recall when we announced the Fox deal, we noted that it would serve these same strategic priorities. And for this reason, we are confident the assets we're in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved. We're still deep in the regulatory process so I can't share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets as part of our ongoing strategy to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace.
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss details of our Q2 results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"
191564,557707807,1456625,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 08, 2018",2018-05-08,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results t",1165,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results this quarter reflects strength in our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments.
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 13% and operating income was up 27%, driven by growth at our domestic and international Parks and Resorts. I'll note that second quarter results reflect the benefit of 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas, the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in the third quarter last year. 
We estimate the timing of Easter drove a $47 million benefit to operating income. This benefit was partially offset by the adverse impact of a 14-day dry dock of the Disney Magic, which reduced Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. The segment delivered another quarter of stellar results with revenue and operating income setting new Q2 records even after taking into account the net impact of these 2 items.
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to higher guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending was up 6% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 12% and occupancy was up about 2 percentage points to 90%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 5% in the quarter and reflects about a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4% compared to prior year, reflecting reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishment and the impact of only 1 week of the Easter holiday period in the third quarter compared to 2 weeks last year. Booked rates are pacing up 8%.
At our international Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was due to increases at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At Disneyland Paris, the resort's 25th anniversary celebration continued to drive higher guest spending, attendance and hotel occupancy. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to increases in occupied room nights and attendance. At Shanghai Disney Resort, unfavorable weather early in the quarter resulted in lower attendance, which drove a decrease in operating income compared to prior year. However, we saw a nice recovery starting in March and expect this positive trend to continue given the recent launch of Toy Story Land.
Total segment operating income margin was up 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Our studio had another phenomenal quarter. Operating income was up 29% to $847 million, setting a new second quarter record. Growth in operating income was due to increases in our Theatrical and home entertainment businesses and growth in TV/SVOD distribution. We had expected Q2 theatrical results to face a comparability challenge given the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carry over performance of Rogue One and Moana during the second quarter last year. However, as Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Black Panther, which surpassed our expectations and drove a meaningful increase in our worldwide theatrical results.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income decreased in the second quarter due to lower equity income and a decline at cable. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu, partially offset by higher income from our investment in A+E. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by a continued investment in programming and marketing, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Cable operating income was lower in the quarter due to losses at BAMTech, and to a lesser extent, lower results at Freeform and ESPN. I'll remind you that BAMTech's results last year were reflected in equity in the income of investees but are now reported as part of our cable results do to our acquisition of a controlling stake last year. The operating loss of BAMTech for the second quarter reflects ongoing investment in its technology platform, including cost associated with ESPN Plus. We now expect BAMTech's results to have an adverse impact on Media Networks' fiscal 2018 operating income of $180 million compared to the prior year. This is $50 million worse than our previous estimate due primarily to increased investment in ESPN Plus. I'll also note that about $100 million of the full year impact is expected during the third quarter.
At ESPN, higher programming expenses more than offset growth in affiliate and advertising revenues. The increase in programming spend was driven by the timing of both the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl game and the start of the Major League Baseball season and contractual rate increases for other college sports and MBA programming. Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter. However, the mix of games included the 2 semifinal games in Q2 this year, whereas, the semifinal games aired in the first quarter last year.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 3% in the quarter due to higher rates, which benefited from the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. We estimate the shift of the 2 semifinal bowl games into Q2 this year had a positive impact of about 5 percentage points on ad revenue growth in the second quarter. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 1% compared to prior year.
Broadcasting results were comparable to Q2 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue, lower income from program sales and higher network programming and marketing expenses. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher rates. Lower income from program sales primarily reflects higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year compared to this year. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 27% above upfront levels.
Total Media Network's affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.
While the impact of subscriber declines on affiliate revenue growth still rounds to 3 points, I'll note that this is the third consecutive quarter we've seen modest deceleration in the rate of net subscriber declines. 
And finally, Consumer Product and Interactive Media results were lower in the quarter as higher licensing income was more than offset by lower comparable store sales in our retail business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
During second quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we repurchased 31.3 million shares for approximately $3.2 billion.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

Can you talk about the runway ahead for that business, whether it's sort of pricing power, capacity at the hotels. You mentioned -- or Christine mentioned 90% occupancy. The ability to drive additional operating leverage. I think your margins are -- I think, they're at all-time highs. When you look out over the next 3 to 4 years, assuming the economy is okay, can you just talk about the drivers of continued growth at the levels we've gotten accustomed to? And on the digital front, I don't know if you can answer this, but I thought I'd take a stab. You announced your digital pivot last year ahead of the Fox announcement. So maybe you could talk about how essential or not Fox and its associated global assets are to your digital strategy as you look out over time?"

One, I mean, expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously, the bottom line. One will come from expansion. As you know, we are building out all of our parks, including the Toy Story Land that's about to open in Florida, the one that just opened in Shanghai, the cruise ships, the 2 Star Wars Lands, multiple hotels around the world, new lands in places like Paris and Tokyo and I could go on. So that's one. Two, we believe, that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth, and that's, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand it is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience. And the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that, that opportunity exists. So we feel, overall, great about the future of this business, particularly, by the way, as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that. On the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the 2 new digital products, the ESPN Plus product and the Disney product well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition. On the sports front, the regional sports networks and then on the Disney front, we think there's some great opportunities for Nat Geo and some of the other Fox properties to be part of the Disney family direct-to-consumer proposition, but that largely is going to be anchored by Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, so not dependent at all on the assets that we're buying from Fox. Of course, we end up in this acquisition owning 60% of Hulu, and it is our intention to continue to fuel Hulu with more original programming. And much of that original programming will come from the assets of both Disney and Fox. Think FX as one example, Searchlight is another, us using some of the other Fox's intellectual property. But I'd say when we announced a year ago, we were not talking about Hulu, we were talking about these 2 new properties. And again, neither is dependent upon, but stands to benefit from the Fox acquisition."

There's always opportunity to get better, and that's what we'll do. But basically, I give it a so far, so good. I watched -- not on a WiFi connection, but I watched the other day a live Yankee game, basically while I was sitting in my car, and was -- the quality was fantastic. And I found that as I've customized it with my favorite teams, et cetera and so on, that it's serving me and my sports interest quite well and I assume that's the case with our consumers. We did announce today the acquisition of the UFC events starting in 2019 for 5 years. That's a start. We intend to continue to invest in buying product that is original, whether that is specific for the app, both live sports and non-live sports. We've also moved some product over there and put some library products over there, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to fuel that experience with product you don't get to see on the linear network. Just, for instance, we've launched the equivalent of a short SportsCenter that Scott Van Pelt is doing that will be available on a daily basis. So there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to continue to invest. On the Disney front, we're in right now the process of creating a lot of original content. We're launching in late 2019. That's to wait for some of our movie output to become available once the Netflix deal expires and also to give us an opportunity to ramp up some of the original content that we're creating for it. And we've said a few times we're going to get more specific about that as we get closer, but we're producing right now content for -- original content that is Pixar-branded, Marvel-branded, Star Wars-branded and Disney-branded, and we are feeling quite good about the direction that we're headed there. In the Disney case, we're looking for quality over quantity. We're not looking for essentially massive amounts of content, we're looking for high quality content utilizing those brands and the franchisee and characters that fall under those brands. Right now, I feel good about both."

We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and there may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets who would love us to put the Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets and consider all the factors that we typically have to consider, which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that there's -- in that -- an inevitably to us of building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look. On the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized. And you typically find Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes a global means of managing customers, data management, billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it, essentially, one technology. And I then thought, but if we were to -- if all these assets were to come together today from Day 1 in effect -- on Day 1 without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition because, if it made sense, once we buy Fox, it seem to make sense even before that. So what we basically did is we have 3 primary content divisions. One, I'll call Media Networks or television; another one will be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio, the Fox assets would plug into all 3 of those. Then, there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in inefficiencies, really, between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts. And then we looked at creating essentially a global platform or distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses but then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring. And it seemed to make sense that international become part of that, part because as part of the acquisition, there are 2 big platforms, Sky and Star, that are part of that. And so if this acquisition happens, it seemed to make sense that the international assets and, I'll call, the global platform assets are in one business. And so there's just a lot of efficiencies in managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world, it's our intention to create a great user experience and an efficient way, not only of our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. And the -- it really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is to continue as a company to invest and to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern, more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it and diversify the company internationally."

So because of the size of the cast involved and the cost of the movie and all the special effects, the scale, the magnitude, while this film is going to be very profitable, it may not be at the same return level of some of the other films just because of the sheer scale of it."

We have primarily resorted to using time and marketing opportunity on the ESPN platforms, including the channels, the magazine, the websites and the existing app. ESPN digital is the most popular sports digital product out there. It dwarves some of the competition, and that gave us ample opportunity to promote, basically, what is a new app experience. So the marketing costs are modest. There's some investment and additional programming prior to launch, but we made more investment with the announcement of UFC. That doesn't come until 2019, and we're going to continue to invest in product to make ESPN Plus a real digital sports marketplace. We're not going to give the specifics about the size of the Toy Story Land, but it marked a substantial increase or in expansion of that park, building a new land. It's not as large, by the way, as the Toy Story Land that we're opening this summer in Orlando, but having been there last week, it's sizable in nature, it's got some great attractions, retail and dining experiences. And it makes -- I'll call, it makes a dent in terms of the scale of the park. But we have ample opportunity to grow Shanghai Disneyland beyond what we've already built."

We're very pleased with our results in Q2, especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses. Our Parks continue to drive growth through operational excellence and by effectively leveraging our extraordinary content. As an example, I just got back from opening our new Toy Story Land in Shanghai Disneyland, and I'm happy to report that our first major addition to the park was met with strong reviews and great excitement. We're thrilled with the reaction and enthusiasm generated by the new land bodes well for future expansion.
Toy Story Land also opens in Orlando next month. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will open in both Disneyland and Disney World by the end of calendar 2019, and there's a lot more expansion underway in our Parks and Resorts around the world.
Turning to our Studio. It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to adequately express the tremendous work that team is doing. It's clear from the recent results as well as from the slate ahead that our Studio has and will continue to raise the bar in terms of both creative and commercial success.
The incredible performance of Marvel's Black Panther is just one of many examples. This groundbreaking movie opened to huge claim and record-breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age old industry myths. With more than $1.3 billion in box office to-date, Black Panther makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk-taking and the value of inclusion. We're proud of this movie on so many levels. It speaks values about great innovative storytelling, the power of new perspectives and unbridled creativity.
We followed the phenomenal success of Black Panther with another Marvel masterpiece, Avengers: Infinity War, which broke domestic and global records to become the largest movie opening in history. With this latest success, our studio has delivered 9 of the top 10 biggest domestic box office openings of all time, all of them released in the last 6 years. Infinity War crossed $1 billion of the box office faster than any film ever released, with worldwide box office of $1.2 billion to-date before it is even opened in China.
Judging from strong ticket pre-sales and anticipation I saw during my recent visit, Chinese audiences are eager to see this movie, too. There are now 19 movies in the Marvel cinematic universe with a combined box office of more than $16 billion and an average box office of $845 million per film. The MCU is, by far, the most lucrative box office franchise of all time, creating an incredible pipeline of proven branded IP that drives significant opportunity across our entire organization.
The rest of our Studio slate is just as impressive, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is generating a lot of interest and strong buzz ahead of its Memorial Day weekend opening. We'll follow that by releasing a dozen big movies over the next 18 months, including Incredibles 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Frozen 2 and Star Wars Episode IX.
Looking at this collection gives you a real sense of what's in store when we launched our Disney branded direct-to-consumer service in late 2019. We're creating a truly unique value proposition for consumers, a service focused on quality over quantity, featuring film and television products from our foremost collection of family-oriented brands. Our content strategy includes a rich mix of beloved classics, recent releases and new content being created exclusively for the new platform by Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. We'll share more details in the coming months, including the robust slate of original movies, series and other content currently being developed.
The deeper we delve into the possibilities of this platform, the more excited we are by its potential to drive value and we're more confident than ever that we're creating an exceptional expert entertainment experience that consumers will find very appealing.
On the sports front, we're very encouraged by the reaction to our ESPN Plus service, which launched just about a month ago. The reviews have been strong and the response of sports fans has been enthusiastic. And the new deal we announced this morning will add a rich slate of UFC content to the mix, including live events and original content creating exclusively for ESPN Plus. 
As we've said before, our incomparable collection of strong brands recognized and respected the world over puts us in great position to lead the way when it comes to building the direct relationships with consumers that will define the future of media. Our recent reorganization reflects our determination to effectively capitalize on a rapidly changing landscape increasingly defined by transformative technology and evolving consumer expectations.
Our Studio and Media Networks are content engines for the entire company, and we're maximizing their value by combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content that people around the world want most, with far more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before.
We're also merging Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts together, combining strategy and resources to create extraordinary experiences and products that bring our stories and characters to life for consumers inside our parks, at home and beyond. We believe this new structure positions our businesses for the future, creating a more effective global framework to serve consumers worldwide, promote growth and maximize shareholder value.
It brings our operations into even closer alignment with our long-term strategy, creating high quality content, innovative use of technology and global expansion, including robust direct-to-consumer distribution.
If you recall when we announced the Fox deal, we noted that it would serve these same strategic priorities. And for this reason, we are confident the assets we're in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved. We're still deep in the regulatory process so I can't share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets as part of our ongoing strategy to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace.
I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss details of our Q2 results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"
191564,557707807,1460308,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 08, 2018",2018-05-08,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results t",1165,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results this quarter reflects strength in our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments.
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 13% and operating income was up 27%, driven by growth at our domestic and international Parks and Resorts. I'll note that second quarter results reflect the benefit of 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas, the 2-week holiday period fell entirely in the third quarter last year. 
We estimate the timing of Easter drove a $47 million benefit to operating income. This benefit was partially offset by the adverse impact of a 14-day dry dock of the Disney Magic, which reduced Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. The segment delivered another quarter of stellar results with revenue and operating income setting new Q2 records even after taking into account the net impact of these 2 items.
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to higher guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending was up 6% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 12% and occupancy was up about 2 percentage points to 90%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 5% in the quarter and reflects about a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4% compared to prior year, reflecting reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishment and the impact of only 1 week of the Easter holiday period in the third quarter compared to 2 weeks last year. Booked rates are pacing up 8%.
At our international Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was due to increases at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At Disneyland Paris, the resort's 25th anniversary celebration continued to drive higher guest spending, attendance and hotel occupancy. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to increases in occupied room nights and attendance. At Shanghai Disney Resort, unfavorable weather early in the quarter resulted in lower attendance, which drove a decrease in operating income compared to prior year. However, we saw a nice recovery starting in March and expect this positive trend to continue given the recent launch of Toy Story Land.
Total segment operating income margin was up 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Our studio had another phenomenal quarter. Operating income was up 29% to $847 million, setting a new second quarter record. Growth in operating income was due to increases in our Theatrical and home entertainment businesses and growth in TV/SVOD distribution. We had expected Q2 theatrical results to face a comparability challenge given the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carry over performance of Rogue One and Moana during the second quarter last year. However, as Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Black Panther, which surpassed our expectations and drove a meaningful increase in our worldwide theatrical results.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income decreased in the second quarter due to lower equity income and a decline at cable. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu, partially offset by higher income from our investment in A+E. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by a continued investment in programming and marketing, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Cable operating income was lower in the quarter due to losses at BAMTech, and to a lesser extent, lower results at Freeform and ESPN. I'll remind you that BAMTech's results last year were reflected in equity in the income of investees but are now reported as part of our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling stake last year. The operating loss of BAMTech for the second quarter reflects ongoing investment in its technology platform, including cost associated with ESPN Plus. We now expect BAMTech's results to have an adverse impact on Media Networks' fiscal 2018 operating income of $180 million compared to the prior year. This is $50 million worse than our previous estimate due primarily to increased investment in ESPN Plus. I'll also note that about $100 million of the full year impact is expected during the third quarter.
At ESPN, higher programming expenses more than offset growth in affiliate and advertising revenues. The increase in programming spend was driven by the timing of both the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl game and the start of the Major League Baseball season and contractual rate increases for other college sports and MBA programming. Like last year, ESPN aired 3 of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter. However, the mix of games included the 2 semifinal games in Q2 this year, whereas, the semifinal games aired in the first quarter last year.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 3% in the quarter due to higher rates, which benefited from the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. We estimate the shift of the 2 semifinal bowl games into Q2 this year had a positive impact of about 5 percentage points on ad revenue growth in the second quarter. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 1% compared to prior year.
Broadcasting results were comparable to Q2 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue, lower income from program sales and higher network programming and marketing expenses. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher rates. Lower income from program sales primarily reflects higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year compared to this year. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 27% above upfront levels.
Total Media Network's affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.
While the impact of subscriber declines on affiliate revenue growth still rounds to 3 points, I'll note that this is the third consecutive quarter we've seen modest deceleration in the rate of net subscriber declines. 
And finally, Consumer Product and Interactive Media results were lower in the quarter as higher licensing income was more than offset by lower comparable store sales in our retail business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
During second quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we repurchased 31.3 million shares for approximately $3.2 billion.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

Can you talk about the runway ahead for that business, whether it's sort of pricing power, capacity at the hotels. You mentioned -- or Christine mentioned 90% occupancy. The ability to drive additional operating leverage. I think your margins are -- I think, they're at all-time highs. When you look out over the next 3 to 4 years, assuming the economy is okay, can you just talk about the drivers of continued growth at the levels we've gotten accustomed to? And on the digital front, I don't know if you can answer this, but I thought I'd take a stab. You announced your digital pivot last year ahead of the Fox announcement. So maybe you could talk about how essential or not Fox and its associated global assets are to your digital strategy as you look out over time?"

One, I mean, expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously, the bottom line. One will come from expansion. As you know, we are building out all of our parks, including the Toy Story Land that's about to open in Florida, the one that just opened in Shanghai, the cruise ships, the 2 Star Wars Lands, multiple hotels around the world, new lands in places like Paris and Tokyo and I could go on. So that's one. Two, we believe, that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth, and that's, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand it is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience. And the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that, that opportunity exists. So we feel, overall, great about the future of this business, particularly, by the way, as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that. On the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the 2 new digital products, the ESPN Plus product and the Disney product well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition. On the sports front, the regional sports networks and then on the Disney front, we think there's some great opportunities for Nat Geo and some of the other Fox properties to be part of the Disney family direct-to-consumer proposition, but that largely is going to be anchored by Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, so not dependent at all on the assets that we're buying from Fox. Of course, we end up in this acquisition owning 60% of Hulu, and it is our intention to continue to fuel Hulu with more original programming. And much of that original programming will come from the assets of both Disney and Fox. Think FX as one example, Searchlight is another, us using some of the other Fox's intellectual property. But I'd say when we announced a year ago, we were not talking about Hulu, we were talking about these 2 new properties. And again, neither is dependent upon, but stands to benefit from the Fox acquisition."

A number of people have signed up, obviously, for the trial and our conversion rates have been good so far. Most importantly, the technology is working, the user interface is considered good, the fan reaction has been quite strong. We're going to continue to improve it. There's always opportunity to get better, and that's what we'll do. But basically, I give it a so far, so good. I watched -- not on a WiFi connection, but I watched the other day a live Yankee game, basically while I was sitting in my car, and was -- the quality was fantastic. And I found that as I've customized it with my favorite teams, et cetera and so on, that it's serving me and my sports interest quite well and I assume that's the case with our consumers. We did announce today the acquisition of the UFC events starting in 2019 for 5 years. That's a start. We intend to continue to invest in buying product that is original, whether that is specific for the app, both live sports and non-live sports. We've also moved some product over there and put some library products over there, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to fuel that experience with product you don't get to see on the linear network. Just, for instance, we've launched the equivalent of a short SportsCenter that Scott Van Pelt is doing that will be available on a daily basis. So there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to continue to invest. On the Disney front, we're in right now the process of creating a lot of original content. We're launching in late 2019. That's to wait for some of our movie output to become available once the Netflix deal expires and also to give us an opportunity to ramp up some of the original content that we're creating for it. And we've said a few times we're going to get more specific about that as we get closer, but we're producing right now content for -- original content that is Pixar-branded, Marvel-branded, Star Wars-branded and Disney-branded, and we are feeling quite good about the direction that we're headed there. In the Disney case, we're looking for quality over quantity. We're not looking for essentially massive amounts of content, we're looking for high quality content utilizing those brands and the franchisee and characters that fall under those brands. Right now, I feel good about both."

We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and there may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets who would love us to put the Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets and consider all the factors that we typically have to consider, which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that there's -- in that -- an inevitably to us of building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look. On the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized. And you typically find Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes a global means of managing customers, data management, billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it, essentially, one technology. And I then thought, but if we were to -- if all these assets were to come together today from Day 1 in effect -- on Day 1 without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition because, if it made sense, once we buy Fox, it seem to make sense even before that. So what we basically did is we have 3 primary content divisions. One, I'll call Media Networks or television; another one will be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio, the Fox assets would plug into all 3 of those. Then, there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in inefficiencies, really, between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts. And then we looked at creating essentially a global platform or distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses but then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring. And it seemed to make sense that international become part of that, part because as part of the acquisition, there are 2 big platforms, Sky and Star, that are part of that. And so if this acquisition happens, it seemed to make sense that the international assets and, I'll call, the global platform assets are in one business. And so there's just a lot of efficiencies in managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world, it's our intention to create a great user experience and an efficient way, not only of our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. And the -- it really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is to continue as a company to invest and to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern, more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it and diversify the company internationally."

I'm guessing that we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that. The goal, of course, was for the fourth Avengers series to have a significant conclusion.

Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion on the quarter to Christine and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services. 
We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories. 
The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways the consumers as well as the creative community find extremely compelling. The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision in part by allowing a seamless integration of the businesses, brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead, more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value. 
It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Network Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets. And as you know, Fox also has significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world. 
On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe, and our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal. Although the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these MVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub-losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub-loss in each of the last 4 quarters. 
It's also interesting to note that today, more than half of the U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services, and on average, they subscribe to 3 different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind. Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options of the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy, empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively. 
In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever, and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in-demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace. We have always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers. 
In addition to the recognizable brands and world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content. I thought I'd mention some examples. FX is renowned for great, high-quality television. It takes bold and impressive creative risks, and it is highly respected for identifying, supporting and nurturing innovative talent. Our plan is to provide even more resources to support FX's existing business and to further invest in FX as a brand and as a critical supplier of original content for our DTC platforms. 
National Geographic is another tremendous brand built on quality, one that has global reach and cross-generational appeal. We also like that its values are vital and relevant to a planet facing environmental challenge. Again, our goal is to support Nat Geo's expansion around the world and provide the additional resources required to position the brand as another major provider of DTC content. And we see numerous other exciting opportunities for this brand across our entire company, including in the ecotourism space. 
Fox Searchlight is another creative engine we respect and admire a great deal. With 20 Oscar nominations last year, along with the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's hard to argue that Searchlight needs any help from anyone. Our strategy is to give the studio what it needs to continue to do what it does best and to also expand the brand's high-quality storytelling into the DTC space with original television and film projects. 
20th Century Fox Film is yet another example. It gives us the opportunity to be associated with and to expand iconic movie franchises like Avatar, Marvel's X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman and many others. We're obviously very excited to leverage the Fox assets to enhance and accelerate our DTC strategy, but I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theater experience. It's a vital part of our company, and in fact, our studio just crossed $6 billion in global box office for the third year in a row. 
We're on track for a late 2019 launch of our Disney-branded streaming service. We already have numerous original projects currently in various stages of development and production for this platform, including the world's first live-action Star Wars series and new episodes of the Star Wars Clone Wars animated series. 
Our robust content pipeline also includes theatrical movies such as the live-action version of Disney's Lady and the Tramp as well as new series based on popular IP from across the company such as Disney Channel's High School Musical and Pixar's Monster's Inc. We're also moving forward with brand-new Marvel content, and as I just noted, the Fox acquisition brings even more opportunity to create original programming for this platform. We'll share more details about our Disney DTC plans at an investor presentation in the near future. 
I also want to note the encouraging initial performance of our ESPN+ service, which launched to great reviews and enthusiasm earlier this year. It's still early days, but conversion rates from free trials to paid subscriptions are strong, and subscription growth is exceeding our expectations. ESPN+ will become even more compelling to fans across the sports spectrum as we continue to expand the content and enhance the user experience. 
ESPN has invested wisely in a number of sports events and packages, and the lineup for Plus is quite strong. The UFC and Top Rank boxing packages made Plus extremely attractive for fans of combat sports. Service will also offer over 200 college football games this year, 70 in the first 3 weeks of the season alone. And that's on top of thousands of other college sports events. Live events of Major League Baseball, the NHL and MLS will also be regular features on the service, and our new rights agreement with Italy's [indiscernible], one of the world's top soccer leagues, will add more than 340 matches per season to ESPN+ starting this year. 
It's safe to say we are very pleased with our progress in the DTC space, and having spent months working with Fox management team on integration planning, we're more enthusiastic and excited by all the opportunities ahead. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,573552597,1525013,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the thir",1359,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were up 18% to $1.87. 
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 6%, and operating income was up 15%, driven by growth at both our domestic and international parks and Disney Cruise Line. Results this year included only 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas third quarter results last year reflected the benefit of both weeks of the holiday period. We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate. Despite this headwind, the segment once again delivered very strong results, with revenue and operating income setting new Q3 records. 
Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, partially offset by higher costs. Per-capita spending at our domestic parks was up 5% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the quarter and reflects about a 1 percentage point adverse impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. Occupancy in our domestic hotels was down about 2 percentage points to 86%, reflecting reduced room inventory due to room refurbishments and conversions. So far, this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 2% compared to prior year, while booked rates are pacing up 7%. 
At our international parks and resorts, higher results were due to increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Q3 results at Disneyland Paris were roughly comparable to the prior year. At Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in operating income was primarily driven by the timing of expenses and higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to higher hotel occupancy and increases in attendance and per-capita spending at the park. 
Total segment operating income margin was up 190 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and we estimate the timing of the Easter holiday had an adverse impact of about 60 basis points on the year-over-year margin growth. 
Turning to the Studio. Operating income was higher than third quarter, driven by growth in domestic theatrical distribution due to the performance of Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2 compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Cars 3 in Q3 last year. Avengers: Infinity War has grossed over $2 billion globally, making it Marvel's highest grossing film of all time. Incredibles 2 is the top domestic grossing animated film ever and has generated over $1 billion in global box to date. And we expect Incredibles 2 will end its run as Pixar's highest-grossing film, which is quite an accomplishment, given Pixar's track record. 
TV/SVOD results were also higher in the quarter due to a combination of title availabilities, overall growth in our international business and higher rates. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic home entertainment results due primarily to the timing of Star Wars DVD and Blu-ray titles, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released in Q2 this year, whereas Rogue One was released in Q3 last year. I'd also note that we had about $100 million of film impairments in the quarter primarily related to 2 unreleased titles: a Disney Tunes Studio film and other animated project in early development. 
At Media Networks, operating income was comparable to the third quarter last year, as higher results at broadcasting were offset by a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rate, partially offset by about a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. As Bob mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. While net subscriber counts are still lower than prior year, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing, a slowdown in the rate of decline of traditional subscribers, coupled with an impressive acceleration of growth in digital MVPD subscribers. Our portfolio of networks, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform and ABC, offers compelling programming for consumers and continues to be a driver of both traditional and digital MVPD subscriptions. 
Broadcasting operating income was up 43% in the third quarter due to higher program sales and growth in network affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher income from program sales reflects higher sales of a number of ABC shows, including Designated Survivor and How to Get Away with Murder as well as higher revenue from the sale of Marvel's Luke Cage in Q3 this year compared to The Defenders last year. Growth in affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at the ABC Network was up 3% in the quarter, as higher rates more than offset lower impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech, which, as you know, we now report as part of our cable results. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. 
At cable, operating income was lower in the quarter, as higher results at ESPN were more than offset by a loss at BAMTech. BAMTech's results this quarter reflect higher content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform, including costs associated with ESPN+. 
At ESPN, operating income was higher in the quarter, as growth in affiliate revenue and a favorable comparison to severance costs incurred in Q3 last year more than offset higher programming costs and a decline in advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NBA programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 3% in the quarter, as higher rates were more than offset by lower impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 3% compared to prior year. 
At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, operating income was down in the quarter as a result of lower licensing income and a decline in comp store sales, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. The decline in licensing was driven by lower revenue from the sale of Spider-Man and Cars merchandise, as both properties benefited from theatrical film releases in the prior year, partially offset by higher revenue from Avengers merchandise. We expect some of the headwinds that impacted our Consumer Products business in Q3 will also impact the business in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, corporate expenses were about $100 million higher than the prior year. The single biggest driver of the growth was expenses related to our Fox acquisition. In Q4, we expect corporate expenses to be higher by about $35 million, driven almost entirely by Fox acquisition-related costs. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $970 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 34.6 million shares for approximately $3.6 billion. Given our pending acquisition of Fox and the expected increase in leverage in order to fund the $35.7 billion cash component, we will not be an active buyer of our stock until our total leverage ratios return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. At the time we announced our revised offer for Fox, we said this could happen by the end of fiscal 2021 or by the end of fiscal 2022, depending on the outcome of the Fox-Sky transaction. The ultimate timetable will depend on whether Fox acquires full ownership of Sky as well as the amount of proceeds from the RSN disposition. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

So when I think about your own OTT strategy, you have -- you're building amazing -- you have a great content library. You're acquiring a content library. But you're thinking about maybe different apps to different consumers constitutes different brands. So can you walk through  kind of the pluses and minuses you have in -- within Disney on the strategy of maybe building one app versus going in segments? And how do you think about that?

I'll answer the second question first. So we've -- no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12",474,"Thanks, Michael. I'll answer the second question first. So we've -- no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all. Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the AB apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, less sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that, ultimately, we intend to build. That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately, National Geographical will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect lower volume of product as well, by the way, the costs of producing and owning all that content. Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox will own 60% of Hulu, so that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments, and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app. As we look at all 3, it is our feeling -- and as we look at the environment today, I guess, one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multichannel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want. So rather than one, call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to market what we've already brought to market, Sports Play. I'll call it a Disney Play, which is more family-oriented, and then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics. If a consumer wants all 3, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. So it could be that the consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel the consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment."

Bob, a couple of years ago, when you guys had the first Star Wars film come out, you talked about sort of leveraging the entire company's assets to really make that movie successful or as successful as it could be. Made it a priority for the company. Is there a similar opportunity with this OTT launch? And I don't know if you even want to share with us today. I know it's a year away, but how are you thinking about leveraging the parks or your Media Networks or the parts of the business to really make sure that think gets off the ground and there's much momentum as possible? And then, Christine, for you, honestly, a bit of an accounting question, but I think important. Have you guys figured out how you're going to account for the content production on the OTT? So I think you're already spending money on developing, and I don't know if you're close to shooting anything at this point, but well, that's up on the balance sheet and then be amortized over some useful life estimate? Anything you can give us there since this will start to build in dollar terms would be helpful."

Maybe eventually, we will, but right now, we don't intend to. We are looking at incremental investment from a content perspective from both the Disney side of the company. So we have a variety of different, as you know, original productions in development and production right now essentially to feed the app. We also intend to turn to the Fox side of the business. I mentioned National Geographic, FX, Searchlight. We look at the Fox television studios. They are not only great franchises and brands that come out of those organizations, but there's a lot of talent, both on the executive front, and there's also talent -- there are relationships that we can turn to help essentially fuel the direct-to-consumer businesses that we have. We have not been specific about what kind of incremental production cost is associated, but there will be -- certainly, there will be some.

Year-over-year, the park margin expanded by 190 basis points this quarter, and that included the negative drag from the holiday shift. So that included the 60 basis point drag.

Obviously, I don't think it covers all what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products, as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix. And so we actually believe that they can, in a sense, live side by side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily cause -- create issues. I think this is a reality that is set in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real and is probably going to continue to either compete with more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors. The first one, ESPN+, I realized when I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, ""Well, what are they?"" and we haven't been specific. I think we don't tell you that we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good. We had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific the numbers. We're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would ultimately achieve, from the beginning, in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually, we've added nicely to that product offering. Fox is the probably the primary example, but there's been some other good programming as well. And we've been heartened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong, and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product, I mentioned in my comments we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first 3 weeks. UFC kicks in. Today, we announced the inclusion of a very attractive -- the very attraction Italian soccer league, [indiscernible]. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN Plus, which is very exciting. And then, of course, the season unfolds the next baseball season and the NHL season, MLS, there'll be regular games from all 3 of those leagues and more and more programming. So we feel really good about how we're positioned, and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for. We still have some opportunities, including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along. Give you an example is we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series, and we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days, we believe, is a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. We're -- it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective, and we feel great about it."

What we want to do is we want to make sure, when we launch, that it's a quality product, that we're serving the fans, particularly of Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars well and that the price that we're charging reflects the value that we're delivering. We've mentioned a number of times that we have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game but to be in the quality game. And that's not in any way suggesting that Netflix isn't in the quality game. There's a lot of quality there, but they're also in the high-volume game. And we don't really need to do that. We will fill in, in terms of creating volume with a significant amount of library content, both movie and television content. And so it's not -- though the coverage's going to be there, but we want to produce the programming that we're putting on under the right circumstances, which is -- means with the right budget and right timing. It takes time to produce these, particularly produce them well. There are a number that already in production. And so -- that we feel good about ultimately what we're going to lunch with. But I think the way to look at it is to look at it as a service that's focused on those brands. We'll also infuse it with National Geographic product as well when the time is right to do that. We will continue to spend incrementally on the service. Talk about that a fair amount. But we will always do so, again, with the knowledge that because the specificity of these brands and the uniqueness of them that we don't have to be in the absolute volume game. We have to put enough on to make sense from a value -- a price to value relationship perspective."

You've listed now a couple of times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service. I guess, my question is, pretty much every brand you listed, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners. So for instance, I'm thinking about Star Wars. The movies are either on Netflix or even on Turner cable syndication in the states. Marvel movies are on Stars or Netflix, that sort of thing. So I guess, my question is, can you just confirm that when you launch, a whole bunch of those historical products associated with those brands, I guess, will not be on your service, it doesn't sound like, that there's something there where there's no Star Wars old movies at all, maybe.

And so one of the reasons why we've talked about -- I don't want to say walk before we run because it's not quite that. There's going to be a fair amount of running going on. But we want to make sure we're managing expectations. The price of the service will reflect that. The volume of the product it's on. But it's also one of the reasons why we're creating a fair amount of original content for it as well, original Star Wars series, original Pixar series, original Marvel series, and so on, and some original films as well because it's clear that, from a library perspective, while there's certainly a lot of volume, the recent studio slate will not fully be available at any one time because of the existing deals and take time for those rights ultimately to revert back to us.

I wondered if there's anything more you could give us a hint on as to what happens with the remainder of the Sky stake that Comcast is bidding for. I don't know if there's anything you can say. And likewise, on the RSNs, I thought the original understanding was that Fox would take those back if that were a regulatory issue. It now seems more like this is something you would take on and then be forced to sell. I don't know if there's anything you could mention on that as well, please."

We took on -- initially, in the December deal that we announced, we assumed the responsibility of divestiture if the regulatory process demanded that we do that. It was not -- it wasn't Fox that would either buy them under the circumstance or would take them back. The RSNs, though, in the agreement that was reached with the Justice Department will be sold. And the process of selling them is actually already beginning in that conversations are starting, interest is being expressed. And it's likely that we'll negotiate a deal to sell them, but the deal will not be fully executed or won't close until after the overall deal of the 21st Century Fox closes. There's nothing more really to add on that. On Sky, there's really nothing further to add. I think, just to clarify because there were some erroneous reports about this, but there was a filing in the U.K. today. It was a formal filing as per U.K. law. And that's what Fox had to do to basically formalize its GBP 14 offer for the remaining 61%. But as per our July 8-K filing, our consent is required for an increase in that bid. And since this is a fluid situation, an open matter, we really are not going to comment any further about it. I think that would be the most appropriate."

Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion of the quarter to Christine, and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox acquisition to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services. We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories.  
The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways the consumers, as well as the creative community, find extremely compelling. The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision, in part by allowing a seamless integration of the businesses, brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead, more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value. 
It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Network Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets. And as you know, Fox also has significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world. 
On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe, and our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal. Although the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these VMVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub-losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub-loss in each of the last 4 quarters. 
It's also interesting to note that today, more than half of the U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services. And on average, they subscribe to 3 different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind. Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options in the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy, empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively. 
In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever, and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in-demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace. We have always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC, make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers. 
In addition to the recognizable brands and world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content. I thought I'd mention some examples. FX is renowned for great, high-quality television. It takes bold and impressive creative risks and it is highly respected for identifying, supporting and nurturing innovative talent. Our plan is to provide even more resources to support FX's existing business and to further invest in FX as a brand and as a critical supplier of original content for our DTC platforms. 
National Geographic is another tremendous brand built on quality, one that has global reach and cross-generational appeal. We also like that its values are vital and relevant to a planet facing environmental challenge. Again, our goal is to support Nat Geo's expansion around the world and provide the additional resources required to position the brand as another major provider of DTC content, and we see numerous other exciting opportunities for this brand across our entire company including in the ecotourism space. 
Fox Searchlight is another creative engine we respect and admire a great deal. With 20 Oscar nominations last year, along with the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's hard to argue that Searchlight needs any help from anyone. Our strategy is to give the studio what it needs to continue to do what it does best and to also expand the brand's high-quality storytelling into the DTC space with original television and film projects. 
20th Century Fox Film is yet another example. It gives us the opportunity to be associated with and to expand iconic movie franchises like Avatar, Marvel's X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman and many others. We're obviously very excited to leverage the Fox assets to enhance and accelerate our DTC strategy, but I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theater experience. It's a vital part of our company, and in fact, our studio just crossed $6 billion in global box office for the third year in a row. 
We're on track for a late 2019 launch of our Disney-branded streaming service. We already have numerous original projects currently in various stages of development and production for this platform, including the world's first live-action Star Wars series and new episodes of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series. 
Our robust content pipeline also includes theatrical movies such as the live-action version of Disney's Lady and the Tramp as well as new series based on popular IP from across the company such as Disney Channel's High School Musical and Pixar's Monsters, Inc. We're also moving forward with brand-new Marvel content. And as I just noted, the Fox acquisition brings even more opportunity to create original programming for this platform. We'll share more details about our Disney DTC plans at an investor presentation in the near future. 
I also want to note the encouraging initial performance of our ESPN Plus service, which launched to great reviews and enthusiasm earlier this year. It's still early days, but conversion rates from free trials to paid subscriptions are strong, and subscription growth is exceeding our expectations. ESPN Plus will become even more compelling to fans across the sports spectrum as we continue to expand the content and enhance the user experience. 
ESPN has invested wisely in a number of sports events and packages, and the lineup for Plus is quite strong. The UFC and Top Rank Boxing packages made Plus extremely attractive for fans of combat sports. Service will also offer over 200 college football games this year, 70 in the first 3 weeks of the season alone, and that's on top of thousands of other college sports events. Live events of Major League Baseball, the NHL and MLS will also be regular features on the service and our new rights agreement with Italy's Serie A, one of the world's top soccer leagues, will add more than 340 matches per season to ESPN Plus starting this year. 
It's safe to say we are very pleased with our progress in the DTC space, and having spent months working with Fox management team on integration planning, we're even more enthusiastic and excited by all the opportunities ahead. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,573552597,1525265,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the thir",1364,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were up 18% to $1.87. 
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 6% and operating income was up 15%, driven by growth at both our domestic and international parks and Disney Cruise Line. Results this year included only 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas third quarter results last year reflected the benefit of both weeks of the holiday period. We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate. Despite this headwind, the segment once again delivered very strong results with revenue and operating income setting new Q3 records. 
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 5% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the quarter, and reflects about a 1 percentage point adverse impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. Occupancy in our domestic hotels was down about 2 percentage points to 86%, reflecting reduced room inventory due to room refurbishments and conversions. So far, this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 2% compared to prior year, while booked rates are pacing up 7%. 
At our international Parks and Resorts, higher results were due to increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Q3 results at Disneyland Paris were roughly comparable to the prior year. At Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in operating income was primarily driven by the timing of expenses and higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to higher hotel occupancy and increases in attendance and per capita spending at the park. 
Total segment operating income margin was up 190 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and we estimate the timing of the Easter holiday had an adverse impact of about 60 basis points on the year-over-year margin growth.  
Turning to the Studio. Operating income was higher in the third quarter driven by growth in domestic theatrical distribution due to the performance of Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2 compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Cars 3 in Q3 last year. Avengers: Infinity War has grossed over $2 billion globally, making it Marvel's highest grossing film of all time. Incredibles 2 is the top domestic grossing animated film ever and has generated over $1 billion in global box to date. And we expect Incredibles 2 will end its run as Pixar's highest grossing film, which is quite an accomplishment given Pixar's track record. 
TV/SVOD results were also higher in the quarter due to a combination of title availabilities, overall growth in our international business and higher rates. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic home entertainment results due primarily to the timing of Star Wars DVD and Blu-ray titles, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released in Q2 this year, whereas Rogue One was released in Q3 last year. I'd also note that we had about $100 million of film impairments in the quarter primarily related to 2 unreleased titles, a Disneytoons Studios film and another animated project in early development. 
At Media Networks, operating income was comparable to the third quarter last year, as higher results at broadcasting were offset by a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rate, partially offset by about a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
As Bob mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. While net subscriber counts are still lower than prior year, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing, a slowdown in the rate of decline of traditional subscribers, coupled with an impressive acceleration of growth in digital MVPD subscribers. 
Our portfolio of networks, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform and ABC, offers compelling programming for consumers and continues to be a driver of both traditional and digital MVPD subscriptions. 
Broadcasting operating income was up 43% in the third quarter due to higher program sales and growth in network affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher income from program sales reflects higher sales of a number of ABC shows, including Designated Survivor and How to Get Away with Murder as well as higher revenue from the sale of Marvel's Luke Cage in Q3 this year compared to The Defenders last year. Growth in affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at the ABC Network was up 3% in the quarter, as higher rates more than offset lower impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech, which, as you know, we now report as part of our cable results. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. 
At cable, operating income was lower in the quarter and higher results at ESPN were more than offset by a loss at BAMTech. BAMTech's results this quarter reflect higher content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform, including costs associated with ESPN Plus. 
At ESPN, operating income was higher in the quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and a favorable comparison to severance costs incurred in Q3 last year more than offset higher programming costs and a decline in advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NBA programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 3% in the quarter, as higher rates were more than offset by lower impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 3% compared to prior year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, operating income was down in the quarter as a result of lower licensing income and a decline in comp store sales, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. The decline in licensing was driven by lower revenue from the sale of Spider-Man and Cars merchandise, as both properties benefited from theatrical film releases in the prior year, partially offset by higher revenue from Avengers merchandise. We expect some of the headwinds that impacted our Consumer Products business in Q3 will also impact the business in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, corporate expenses were about $100 million higher than the prior year. The single biggest driver of the growth was expenses related to our Fox acquisition. In Q4, we expect corporate expenses to be higher by about $35 million, driven almost entirely by Fox acquisition-related costs. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $970 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 34.6 million shares for approximately $3.6 billion. Given our pending acquisition of Fox and the expected increase in leverage in order to fund the $35.7 billion cash component, we will not be an active buyer of our stock until our total leverage ratios return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. 
At the time we announced our revised offer for Fox, we said this could happen by the end of fiscal 2021 or by the end of fiscal 2022, depending on the outcome of the Fox-Sky transaction. The ultimate timetable will depend on whether Fox acquires full ownership of Sky as well as the amount of proceeds from the RSN disposition. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

If you think about what Netflix was able to accomplish, it was just an amazing amount of choice and personalization. So when I think about your own OTT strategy, you have -- you're building amazing -- you have a great content library, you're acquiring a content library, but you're thinking about maybe different apps to different consumers constitutes different brands. So can you walk through kind of the pluses and minuses you have in -- within Disney on the strategy of maybe building one integrated app versus going in segments and how do you think about that?

I'll answer the second question first. So we've -- no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12",474,"Thanks, Michael. I'll answer the second question first. So we've -- no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all. Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that, ultimately, we intend to build. That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately, National Geographical will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect the lower volume of product as well, by the way, the costs of producing and owning all that content. Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu, so that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments, and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app. As we look at all 3, it is our feeling -- and as we look at the environment today, I guess, one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multichannel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want. So rather than one, call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to market what we've already brought to market, Sports Play -- I'll call it, it's Disney Play, which is more family-oriented, and then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics. If a consumer wants all 3, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel the consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment."

And then, Christine, for you, honestly, a bit of an accounting question, but I think important. Have you guys figured out how you're going to account for the content production on the OTT?

And then on the second part, I'll let Christine talk about the costs and then how we're going to ultimately manage it from a financial perspective."

Maybe eventually, we will, but right now, we don't intend to. We are looking at incremental investment from a content perspective from both the Disney side of the company. So we have a variety of different, as you know, original productions in development and production right now essentially to feed the app. We also intend to turn to the Fox side of the business, I mentioned National Geographic, FX, Searchlight, we're looking at the Fox television studios. They are not only great franchises and brands that come out of those organizations, but there's a lot of talent, both on the executive front, and there's also talent -- there are relationships that we can turn through the help, essentially, to fuel the direct-to-consumer businesses that we have. We have not been specific about what kind of incremental production cost is associated, but there will be -- certainly, there will be some.

Year-over-year, the park margin expanded by 190 basis points this quarter, and that included the negative drag from the holiday shift, so that included the 60 basis point drag.

I think you've said it's exceeding expectation, I don't know if it's too soon to give us a number, and if there are any lessons you may have learned as you planned for the Disney direct-to-consumer launch from that launch. And my second question is really if you -- I think you're going through a pretty notable renewal cycle between your major affiliate deals up in 2019. The question really is how are you balancing those negotiations with the distributors, given your high-profile direct-to-consumer priorities?"

We'll be going to market with some very attractive product. Obviously, I don't think it cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors",571,"Well, I'll answer the second question. We'll be going to market with some very attractive product. Obviously, I don't think it cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products, as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix. And so we actually believe that they can, in a sense, live side by side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily cause -- create issues. I think there's a reality that is set in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real and is probably going to continue to either compete with more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors. But first on ESPN Plus, I realized what I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, ""Well, what are they?"" and we haven't been specific. I think it will tell you that we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good. We had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific on numbers, we're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would achieve, from the beginning, in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually, we've added nicely to that product offering. Fox is probably the primary example, but there's been some other good programming as well. And we've been hardened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong, and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product, I mentioned in my comments we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first 3 weeks. UFC kicks in. Today, we announced the inclusion of the very attractive Italian soccer league, Serie A. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN Plus, which is exciting. And then, of course, as the season unfolds the next baseball season and the NHL season. MLS, there'll be regular games from all 3 of those leagues and more and more programming. So we feel really good about how we're positioned, and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for. We still have some opportunities, including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along. I'll give you an example is we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series. And we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days, we believe, is a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. We're -- it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective and we feel great about it."

What we want to do is we want to make sure, when we launch, that this is a quality product, that we're serving the fans, particularly of Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars well, and that the price that we're charging reflects the value that we're delivering. We've mentioned a number of times that we have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game but to be in the quality game. And that's not in any way suggesting that Netflix isn't in the quality game, there's a lot of quality there, but they're also in the high-volume game. And we don't really need to do that. We will fill in, in terms of creating volume with a significant amount of library content, both movie and television content. And so it's not -- though the coverage is going to be there, but we want to produce the programming that we're putting on under the right circumstances, which is -- means with the right budget and right timing. It takes time to produce these, particularly to produce them well. There are a number that already in production. And so -- that we feel good about, ultimately, what we're going to lunch with. But I think the way to look at it is to look at it as a service that is focused on those brands. We'll also infuse it with National Geographic product as well when the time is right to do that. We will continue to spend incrementally on the service. We talked about that a fair amount. But we will always do so, again, with the knowledge that because of the specificity of these brands and the uniqueness of them that we don't have to be in the absolute volume game. We have to put enough on to make sense from a value -- a price to value relationship perspective."

So you've listed now a couple of times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service. I guess, my question is, pretty much every brand you lifted, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners. So for instance, I'm thinking about Star Wars. The movies are either on Netflix or even on Turner cable syndication in the States. Marvel movies are on Stars or Netflix, that sort of thing. So I guess, my question is, can you just confirm that when you launch a whole bunch of those historical products associated with those brands, I guess, will not be on your service, it doesn't sound like, in fact there's some scenario where there's no Star Wars old movies at all, maybe. I'd love a comment on that, I might be wrong because I don't the exact carve outs. So that's the main question.

But starting in 2019, the movies that  -- the studio movie slate is clean and unencumbered. And so one of the reasons why we've talked about -- I don't want to say walk before we run, it's not quite that, there's going to be a fair amount of running going on, but we want to make sure we're managing expectations. The price of the service will reflect that. The volume of the product it's on. But it's also one of the reasons why we're creating a fair amount of original content for it as well, original Star Wars series, original Pixar series, original Marvel series, and so on, and some original films as well because it's clear that, from a library perspective, while there's certainly a lot of volume, the recent studio slate will not fully be available at any one time because of the existing deals and it would take time for those rights, ultimately, to revert back to us.

And as rights become available or as we're able to negotiate for rights to bring back, you'll see them on the service and so on, and so on. But if you look at the 2019 studio slate, I was -- I saw something recently posted just about the studio slate. So in calendar 2019, the studio slate is about as strong as it gets. And to give you some ideas, it's got Avengers -- Dumbo -- Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Artemis Fowl, Jungle Cruise, Frozen 2 and Star Wars Episode IX, all in calendar 2019.

It was not -- it wasn't Fox that would either buy them under the circumstance or would take them back. The RSNs, though, in the agreement that was reached with the Justice Department will be sold and the process of selling them is actually already beginning in that conversations are starting, interest is being expressed. And it's likely that we'll negotiate a deal to sell them, but the deal will not be fully executed or won't close until after the overall deal for 21st Century Fox closes. There's nothing more really to add on that. On Sky, there's really nothing further to add. I think, just to clarify because there were some erroneous reports about this, but there was a filing in the U.K. today, it was a formal filing as per U.K. law, and that's what Fox had to do to basically formalize its GBP 14 offer for the remaining 61%. But as per our July 8-K filing, our consent is required for an increase in that bid. And since this is a fluid situation, an open matter, we really are not going to comment any further about it. I think that would be the most appropriate."

Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion of the quarter to Christine, and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox acquisition to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services. We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories.  
The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways the consumers, as well as the creative community, find extremely compelling. The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision, in part by allowing the seamless integration of the businesses, brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead, more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value. 
It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Network Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets. And as you know, Fox also has a significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world. 
On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe, and our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal. Although the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these VMVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub loss in each of the last 4 quarters. 
It's also interesting to note that today, more than half of U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services. And on average, they subscribe to 3 different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind. Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options in the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy, empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively. 
In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever, and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in-demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace. We have always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC, make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers. 
In addition to their recognizable brands and world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content. I thought I'd mention some examples. 
FX is renowned for great, high-quality television. It takes bold and impressive creative risks, and it is highly respected for identifying, supporting and nurturing innovative talent. Our plan is to provide even more resources to support FX's existing business and to further invest in FX as a brand and as a critical supplier of original content for our DTC platforms. 
National Geographic is another tremendous brand built on quality, one that has global reach and cross-generational appeal. We also like that its values are vital and relevant to a planet facing environmental challenge. Again, our goal is to support Nat Geo's expansion around the world and provide the additional resources required to position the brand as another major provider of DTC content, and we see numerous other exciting opportunities for this brand across our entire company, including in the ecotourism space. 
Fox Searchlight is another creative engine we respect and admire a great deal. With 20 Oscar nominations last year, along with the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's hard to argue that Searchlight needs any help from anyone. Our strategy is to give the studio what it needs to continue to do what it does best and to also expand the brand's high-quality storytelling into the DTC space with original television and film projects. 
20th Century Fox Film is yet another example. It gives us the opportunity to be associated with and to expand iconic movie franchises like Avatar, Marvel's X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman and many others. We're obviously very excited to leverage the Fox assets to enhance and accelerate our DTC strategy, but I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theater experience. It's a vital part of our company, and in fact, our studio just crossed $6 billion in global box office for the third year in a row. 
We're on track for a late 2019 launch of our Disney-branded streaming service. We already have numerous original projects currently in various stages of development and production for this platform, including the world's first live-action Star Wars series and new episodes of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series. 
Our robust content pipeline also includes theatrical movies, such as a live-action version of Disney's Lady and the Tramp, as well as new series based on popular IP from across the company, such as Disney Channel's High School Musical and Pixar's Monsters, Inc. We're also moving forward with brand-new Marvel content. And as I just noted, the Fox acquisition brings even more opportunity to create original programming for this platform. We'll share more details about our Disney DTC plans at an investor presentation in the near future. 
I also want to note the encouraging initial performance of our ESPN Plus service, which launched to great reviews and enthusiasm earlier this year. It's still early days, but conversion rates from free trials to paid subscriptions are strong, and subscription growth is exceeding our expectations. ESPN Plus will become even more compelling to fans across the sports spectrum as we continue to expand the content and enhance the user experience. 
ESPN has invested wisely in a number of sports events and packages, and the lineup for Plus is quite strong. The UFC and Top Rank Boxing packages made Plus extremely attractive for fans of combat sports. The service will also offer over 200 college football games this year, 70 in the first 3 weeks of the season alone, and that's on top of thousands of other college sports events. Live events from Major League Baseball, the NHL and MLS will also be regular features on the service, and our new rights agreement with Italy's Serie A, one of the world's top soccer leagues, will add more than 340 matches per season to ESPN Plus starting this year. 
It's safe to say we are very pleased with our progress in the DTC space, and having spent months working with Fox management team on integration planning, we're even more enthusiastic and excited by all the opportunities ahead. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,573552597,1537760,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the thir",1364,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were up 18% to $1.87. 
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 6% and operating income was up 15%, driven by growth at both our domestic and international parks and Disney Cruise Line. Results this year included only 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas third quarter results last year reflected the benefit of both weeks of the holiday period. We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate. Despite this headwind, the segment once again delivered very strong results with revenue and operating income setting new Q3 records. 
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 5% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the quarter and reflects about a 1 percentage point adverse impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. Occupancy in our domestic hotels was down about 2 percentage points to 86%, reflecting reduced room inventory due to room refurbishments and conversions. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 2% compared to prior year, while booked rates are pacing up 7%. 
At our international Parks and Resorts, higher results were due to increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Q3 results at Disneyland Paris were roughly comparable to the prior year. At Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in operating income was primarily driven by the timing of expenses and higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to higher hotel occupancy and increases in attendance and per capita spending at the park. 
Total segment operating income margin was up 190 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and we estimate the timing of the Easter holiday had an adverse impact of about 60 basis points on the year-over-year margin growth.  
Turning to the Studio. Operating income was higher in the third quarter driven by growth in domestic theatrical distribution due to the performance of Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2 compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Cars 3 in Q3 last year. Avengers: Infinity War has grossed over $2 billion globally, making it Marvel's highest grossing film of all time. Incredibles 2 is the top domestic grossing animated film ever and has generated over $1 billion in global box to date. And we expect Incredibles 2 will end its run as Pixar's highest grossing film, which is quite an accomplishment given Pixar's track record. 
TV/SVOD results were also higher in the quarter due to a combination of title availabilities, overall growth in our international business and higher rates. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic home entertainment results due primarily to the timing of Star Wars DVD and Blu-ray titles, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released in Q2 this year, whereas Rogue One was released in Q3 last year. I'd also note that we had about $100 million of film impairments in the quarter, primarily related to 2 unreleased titles, a Disneytoon Studios film and another animated project in early development. 
At Media Networks, operating income was comparable to the third quarter last year, as higher results at broadcasting were offset by a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
As Bob mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. While net subscriber counts are still lower than prior year, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing, a slowdown in the rate of decline of traditional subscribers, coupled with an impressive acceleration of growth in digital MVPD subscribers. 
Our portfolio of networks, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform and ABC, offers compelling programming for consumers and continues to be a driver of both traditional and digital MVPD subscriptions. 
Broadcasting operating income was up 43% in the third quarter due to higher program sales and growth in network affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher income from program sales reflects higher sales of a number of ABC shows, including Designated Survivor and How to Get Away with Murder, as well as higher revenue from the sale of Marvel's Luke Cage in Q3 this year compared to The Defenders last year. Growth in affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at the ABC Network was up 3% in the quarter, as higher rates more than offset lower impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime-time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech, which, as you know, we now report as part of our cable results. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. 
At cable, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher results at ESPN were more than offset by a loss at BAMTech. BAMTech's results this quarter reflect higher content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform, including costs associated with ESPN Plus. 
At ESPN, operating income was higher in the quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and a favorable comparison to severance costs incurred in Q3 last year more than offset higher programming costs and a decline in advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NBA programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 3% in the quarter, as higher rates were more than offset by lower impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 3% compared to prior year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, operating income was down in the quarter as a result of lower licensing income and a decline in comp store sales, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. The decline in licensing was driven by lower revenue from the sale of Spider-Man and Cars merchandise, as both properties benefited from theatrical film releases in the prior year, partially offset by higher revenue from Avengers merchandise. We expect some of the headwinds that impacted our Consumer Products business in Q3 will also impact the business in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, corporate expenses were about $100 million higher than the prior year. The single biggest driver of the growth was expenses related to our Fox acquisition. In Q4, we expect corporate expenses to be higher by about $35 million, driven almost entirely by Fox acquisition-related costs. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $970 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 34.6 million shares for approximately $3.6 billion. Given our pending acquisition of Fox and the expected increase in leverage in order to fund the $35.7 billion cash component, we will not be an active buyer of our stock until our total leverage ratios return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. 
At the time we announced our revised offer for Fox, we said this could happen by the end of fiscal 2021 or by the end of fiscal 2022, depending on the outcome of the Fox-Sky transaction. The ultimate timetable will depend on whether Fox acquires full ownership of Sky as well as the amount of proceeds from the RSN disposition. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

If you think about what Netflix was able to accomplish, it was just an amazing amount of choice and personalization. So when I think about your own OTT strategy, you have all this -- you're building amazing -- you have a great content library, you're acquiring a content library, but you're thinking about maybe different apps to different consumers, constituents, different brands. So can you walk through kind of the pluses and minuses you have in -- within Disney on the strategy of maybe building one aggregated app versus going in segments? And how do you think about that?

I'll answer the second question first. We have no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all. Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that, ultimately, we intend to build. That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately National Geographic will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect a lower volume of product, as will, by the way, the cost of producing and owning all that content. Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu, so that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments, and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app. As we look at all 3, it is our feeling -- and as we look at the environment today, I guess, one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multichannel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want. So rather than one, call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to market what we've already brought to market: sports play; I'll call it, it's Disney play, which is more family-oriented; and then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics. If a consumer wants all 3, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment."

I know it's a year away, but how you might be thinking about leveraging the parks or your Media Networks or the parts of the business to really make sure that thing gets off the ground with as much momentum as possible. And then, Christine, for you, it's honestly a bit of an accounting question, but I think important. Have you guys figured out how you're going to account for the content production on the OTT side? I think you're already spending money on developing, and I don't know if you were close to shooting anything at this point, but will that stuff go in the balance sheet and then be amortized over some useful life estimate?

Maybe eventually we will, but right now we don't intend to. We are looking at incremental investment from a content perspective from both the Disney side of the company. So we have a variety of different, as you know, original productions in development and production right now essentially to feed the app. We also intend to turn to the Fox side of the business, I mentioned National Geographic, FX, Searchlight, we're looking at the Fox television studios. There are not only great franchises and brands that come out of those organizations, but there's a lot of talent, both on the executive front, and there's also talent -- there are talent relationships that we can turn to, to help, essentially, fuel the direct-to-consumer businesses that we have. We have not been specific about what kind of incremental production cost is associated, but there will be -- certainly, there will be some. We believe that as we get closer to launch, we'll have the ability to be just a little bit more specific with all of you about what our plans are from a cost perspective."

Year-over-year, the park margin expanded by 190 basis points this quarter, and that included the negative drag from the holiday shift, so that included the 60 basis point drag.

I think you've said it's exceeding expectation. I don't know if it's too soon to give us a number. And if there are any lessons you may have learned, as you plan for the Disney direct-to-consumer launch, from that launch. And my second question is really if you -- I think you're going through a pretty notable renewal cycle, with some of your major affiliate deals up in 2019. The question really is how are you balancing those negotiations with the distributors, given your high-profile direct-to-consumer priorities?"
191564,573552597,1537760,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Well, I'll answer the second question.

Obviously, I don't have to cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products, as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix. And so we actually believe that they can, in a sense, live side by side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily cause -- create issues. I think there's a reality that has set in, in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed, and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real and is probably going to continue to either compete with more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors. But first on ESPN Plus, I realized when I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, ""Well, then, what are they?"" and we haven't been specific. I can only tell you that we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good. We had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would achieve, from the beginning, in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually, we've added nicely to that product offering. Boxing is probably the primary example, but there's been some other good programming as well. And we've been heartened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong, and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product -- I mentioned in my comments we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first 3 weeks. UFC kicks in. Today we announced the inclusion of the very attractive Italian soccer league, Serie A. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN Plus, which is exciting. And then, of course, as the season unfolds, the next baseball season and the NHL season. MLS, there'll be regular games from all 3 of those leagues and more and more programming. So we feel really good about how we're positioned, and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for. We still have some opportunities, including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along. I'll give you an example is we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series. And we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days, we believe, as a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. We're -- it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective. And we feel great about it."

And then for Christine, similar to Ben, an accounting question related to streaming service. How do you manage the pay one rights for calendar '19 films from an accounting perspective? Because it'll apply to other factors as well. Does the film division still include pay one revenue in its ultimates for calendar '19 releases when determining film amortization by window?

What we want to do is, we want to make sure, when we launch, that it's viewed as a quality product, that we're serving the fans, particularly of Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars, well, and that the price that we're charging reflects the value that we're delivering. We've mentioned a number of times that we have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game but to be in the quality game. And that's not in any way suggesting that Netflix isn't in the quality game, there's a lot of quality there, but they're also in the high-volume game. And we don't really need to do that. We will fill in, in terms of creating volume, with a significant amount of library content, both movie and television content. And so it's not as though the cupboard's going to be bare, but we want to produce the programming that we're putting on under the right circumstances, which is -- means with the right budget and right timing. It takes time to produce these, particularly to produce them well. There are a number that are already in production. And so -- that we feel good about, ultimately, what we're going to launch with. But I think the way to look at it is to look at it as a service that is focused on those brands. We'll also infuse it with National Geographic product as well when the time is right to do that. We will continue to spend incrementally on the service. We talked about that a fair amount. But we will always do so, again, with the knowledge that because of the specificity of these brands and the uniqueness of them that we don't have to be in the absolute volume game. We have to put enough on to make sense from a value -- a price-to-value relationship perspective."

So you've listed now a couple of times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service. I guess, my question is, pretty much every brand you listed, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners. So for instance, I'm thinking about Star Wars. The movies are either on Netflix or even on Turner cable syndication in the States. Marvel movies are on Starz or Netflix, that sort of thing. So I guess, my question is, can you just confirm that when you launch, a whole bunch of those historical products associated with those brands, I guess, will not be on your service? It doesn't sound like. In fact, there's some scenario where there's no Star Wars old movies at all, maybe. I'd love a comment on that. I might be wrong because I don't know the exact carve-outs.

It's not quite that. There's going to be a fair amount of running going on. But we want to make sure we're managing expectations. The price of the service will reflect that. The volume of the product that's on. But it's also one of the reasons why we're creating a fair amount of original content for it as well, original Star Wars series, original Pixar series, original Marvel series and so on, and some original films as well, because it's clear that, from a library perspective, while there's certainly a lot of volume, the recent studio slate will not fully be available at any one time because of the existing deals and it would take time for those rights, ultimately, to revert back to us.

I think, just to clarify because there were some erroneous reports about this, but there was a filing in the U.K. today. It was a formal filing as per U.K. law, and that's what Fox had to do to basically formalize its GBP 14 offer for the remaining 61%. But as per our July 8-K filing, our consent is required for an increase in that bid. And since this is a fluid situation, an open matter, we really are not going to comment any further about it. I think that would be the most appropriate."

As Bob mentioned, college football, we are getting into that season and the match-ups are all getting out in the marketplace, and we expect the ad revenue to reflect that. Just looking back at third quarter, I do want to make the note that the difference in the number of NBA playoffs and final games, when you adjust for that -- we had one fewer final. We had 2 fewer semi-finals, but we had the benefit of 3 additional conference finals. When you net all that out, ESPN's ad sales in 3Q would have been roughly similar to the prior year."

Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion of the quarter to Christine, and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox acquisition to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services. We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories.  
The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways the consumers, as well as the creative community, find extremely compelling. The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision, in part by allowing the seamless integration of the businesses, brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead, more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value. 
It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Network Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets. And as you know, Fox also has a significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world. 
On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe, and our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal. Although the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these VMVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub loss in each of the last 4 quarters. 
It's also interesting to note that today, more than half of U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services. And on average, they subscribe to 3 different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind. Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options in the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy, empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively. 
In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever, and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in-demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace. We have always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC, make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers. 
In addition to their recognizable brands and world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content. I thought I'd mention some examples. 
FX is renowned for great, high-quality television. It takes bold and impressive creative risks, and it is highly respected for identifying, supporting and nurturing innovative talent. Our plan is to provide even more resources to support FX's existing business and to further invest in FX as a brand and as a critical supplier of original content for our DTC platforms. 
National Geographic is another tremendous brand built on quality, one that has global reach and cross-generational appeal. We also like that its values are vital and relevant to a planet facing environmental challenge. Again, our goal is to support Nat Geo's expansion around the world and provide the additional resources required to position the brand as another major provider of DTC content, and we see numerous other exciting opportunities for this brand across our entire company, including in the ecotourism space. 
Fox Searchlight is another creative engine we respect and admire a great deal. With 20 Oscar nominations last year, along with the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's hard to argue that Searchlight needs any help from anyone. Our strategy is to give the studio what it needs to continue to do what it does best and to also expand the brand's high-quality storytelling into the DTC space with original television and film projects. 
20th Century Fox Film is yet another example. It gives us the opportunity to be associated with and to expand iconic movie franchises like Avatar, Marvel's X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman and many others. We're obviously very excited to leverage the Fox assets to enhance and accelerate our DTC strategy, but I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theater experience. It's a vital part of our company, and in fact, our studio just crossed $6 billion in global box office for the third year in a row. 
We're on track for a late 2019 launch of our Disney-branded streaming service. We already have numerous original projects currently in various stages of development and production for this platform, including the world's first live-action Star Wars series and new episodes of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series. 
Our robust content pipeline also includes theatrical movies, such as a live-action version of Disney's Lady and the Tramp, as well as new series based on popular IP from across the company, such as Disney Channel's High School Musical and Pixar's Monsters, Inc. We're also moving forward with brand-new Marvel content. And as I just noted, the Fox acquisition brings even more opportunity to create original programming for this platform. We'll share more details about our Disney DTC plans at an investor presentation in the near future. 
I also want to note the encouraging initial performance of our ESPN Plus service, which launched to great reviews and enthusiasm earlier this year. It's still early days, but conversion rates from free trials to paid subscriptions are strong, and subscription growth is exceeding our expectations. ESPN Plus will become even more compelling to fans across the sports spectrum as we continue to expand the content and enhance the user experience. 
ESPN has invested wisely in a number of sports events and packages, and the lineup for Plus is quite strong. The UFC and Top Rank Boxing packages made Plus extremely attractive for fans of combat sports. The service will also offer over 200 college football games this year, 70 in the first 3 weeks of the season alone, and that's on top of thousands of other college sports events. Live events from Major League Baseball, the NHL and MLS will also be regular features on the service, and our new rights agreement with Italy's Serie A, one of the world's top soccer leagues, will add more than 340 matches per season to ESPN Plus starting this year. 
It's safe to say we are very pleased with our progress in the DTC space, and having spent months working with Fox management team on integration planning, we're even more enthusiastic and excited by all the opportunities ahead. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"
191564,573552597,1538444,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the thir",1364,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were up 18% to $1.87. 
At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 6% and operating income was up 15%, driven by growth at both our domestic and international parks and Disney Cruise Line. Results this year included only 1 week of the Easter holiday period, whereas third quarter results last year reflected the benefit of both weeks of the holiday period. We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate. Despite this headwind, the segment once again delivered very strong results with revenue and operating income setting new Q3 records. 
Higher operating income at our domestic Parks and Resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 5% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the quarter and reflects about a 1 percentage point adverse impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. Occupancy in our domestic hotels was down about 2 percentage points to 86%, reflecting reduced room inventory due to room refurbishments and conversions. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 2% compared to prior year, while booked rates are pacing up 7%. 
At our international Parks and Resorts, higher results were due to increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Q3 results at Disneyland Paris were roughly comparable to the prior year. At Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in operating income was primarily driven by the timing of expenses and higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to higher hotel occupancy and increases in attendance and per capita spending at the park. 
Total segment operating income margin was up 190 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and we estimate the timing of the Easter holiday had an adverse impact of about 60 basis points on the year-over-year margin growth.  
Turning to the Studio. Operating income was higher in the third quarter driven by growth in domestic theatrical distribution due to the performance of Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2 compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Cars 3 in Q3 last year. Avengers: Infinity War has grossed over $2 billion globally, making it Marvel's highest grossing film of all time. Incredibles 2 is the top domestic grossing animated film ever and has generated over $1 billion in global box to date. And we expect Incredibles 2 will end its run as Pixar's highest grossing film, which is quite an accomplishment given Pixar's track record. 
TV/SVOD results were also higher in the quarter due to a combination of title availabilities, overall growth in our international business and higher rates. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic home entertainment results due primarily to the timing of Star Wars DVD and Blu-ray titles, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released in Q2 this year, whereas Rogue One was released in Q3 last year. I'd also note that we had about $100 million of film impairments in the quarter, primarily related to 2 unreleased titles, a Disneytoon Studios film and another animated project in early development. 
At Media Networks, operating income was comparable to the third quarter last year, as higher results at broadcasting were offset by a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
As Bob mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. While net subscriber counts are still lower than prior year, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing, a slowdown in the rate of decline of traditional subscribers, coupled with an impressive acceleration of growth in digital MVPD subscribers. 
Our portfolio of networks, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform and ABC, offers compelling programming for consumers and continues to be a driver of both traditional and digital MVPD subscriptions. 
Broadcasting operating income was up 43% in the third quarter due to higher program sales and growth in network affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher income from program sales reflects higher sales of a number of ABC shows, including Designated Survivor and How to Get Away with Murder, as well as higher revenue from the sale of Marvel's Luke Cage in Q3 this year compared to The Defenders last year. Growth in affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at the ABC Network was up 3% in the quarter, as higher rates more than offset lower impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime-time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech, which, as you know, we now report as part of our cable results. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. 
At cable, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher results at ESPN were more than offset by a loss at BAMTech. BAMTech's results this quarter reflect higher content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform, including costs associated with ESPN Plus. 
At ESPN, operating income was higher in the quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and a favorable comparison to severance costs incurred in Q3 last year more than offset higher programming costs and a decline in advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NBA programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 3% in the quarter, as higher rates were more than offset by lower impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 3% compared to prior year. 
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, operating income was down in the quarter as a result of lower licensing income and a decline in comp store sales, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. The decline in licensing was driven by lower revenue from the sale of Spider-Man and Cars merchandise, as both properties benefited from theatrical film releases in the prior year, partially offset by higher revenue from Avengers merchandise. We expect some of the headwinds that impacted our Consumer Products business in Q3 will also impact the business in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, corporate expenses were about $100 million higher than the prior year. The single biggest driver of the growth was expenses related to our Fox acquisition. In Q4, we expect corporate expenses to be higher by about $35 million, driven almost entirely by Fox acquisition-related costs. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $970 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 34.6 million shares for approximately $3.6 billion. Given our pending acquisition of Fox and the expected increase in leverage in order to fund the $35.7 billion cash component, we will not be an active buyer of our stock until our total leverage ratios return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. 
At the time we announced our revised offer for Fox, we said this could happen by the end of fiscal 2021 or by the end of fiscal 2022, depending on the outcome of the Fox-Sky transaction. The ultimate timetable will depend on whether Fox acquires full ownership of Sky as well as the amount of proceeds from the RSN disposition. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

If you think about what Netflix was able to accomplish, it was just an amazing amount of choice and personalization. So when I think about your own OTT strategy, you have all this -- you're building amazing -- you have a great content library, you're acquiring a content library, but you're thinking about maybe different apps to different consumers, constituents, different brands. So can you walk through kind of the pluses and minuses you have in -- within Disney on the strategy of maybe building one aggregated app versus going in segments? And how do you think about that?

I'll answer the second question first. We have no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all. Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that, ultimately, we intend to build. That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately National Geographic will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect a lower volume of product, as will, by the way, the cost of producing and owning all that content. Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu, so that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments, and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app. As we look at all 3, it is our feeling -- and as we look at the environment today, I guess, one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multichannel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want. So rather than one, call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to market what we've already brought to market: sports play; I'll call it, it's Disney play, which is more family-oriented; and then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics. If a consumer wants all 3, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment."

I know it's a year away, but how you might be thinking about leveraging the parks or your Media Networks or the parts of the business to really make sure that thing gets off the ground with as much momentum as possible. And then, Christine, for you, it's honestly a bit of an accounting question, but I think important. Have you guys figured out how you're going to account for the content production on the OTT side? I think you're already spending money on developing, and I don't know if you were close to shooting anything at this point, but will that stuff go in the balance sheet and then be amortized over some useful life estimate?

Do you have plans to build hotels, given all the attractions that you're planning over the next, let's say, 3 years?"

There will be revenue synergies as well, but we have not been specific about what they are, and we don't intend to get specific about that, at least for the foreseeable future. Maybe eventually we will, but right now we don't intend to. We are looking at incremental investment from a content perspective from both the Disney side of the company. So we have a variety of different, as you know, original productions in development and production right now essentially to feed the app. We also intend to turn to the Fox side of the business, I mentioned National Geographic, FX, Searchlight, we're looking at the Fox television studios. There are not only great franchises and brands that come out of those organizations, but there's a lot of talent, both on the executive front, and there's also talent -- there are talent relationships that we can turn to, to help, essentially, fuel the direct-to-consumer businesses that we have. We have not been specific about what kind of incremental production cost is associated, but there will be -- certainly, there will be some. We believe that as we get closer to launch, we'll have the ability to be just a little bit more specific with all of you about what our plans are from a cost perspective."

Year-over-year, the park margin expanded by 190 basis points this quarter, and that included the negative drag from the holiday shift, so that included the 60 basis point drag. The opportunities that we see of continuing to expand parks margin will be yield management, which we have talked to you about before, and we still believe that there's opportunity for that, especially in the domestic market."

I think you've said it's exceeding expectation. I don't know if it's too soon to give us a number. And if there are any lessons you may have learned, as you plan for the Disney direct-to-consumer launch, from that launch. And my second question is really if you -- I think you're going through a pretty notable renewal cycle, with some of your major affiliate deals up in 2019. The question really is how are you balancing those negotiations with the distributors, given your high-profile direct-to-consumer priorities?"
191564,573552597,1538444,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2018",2018-08-07,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Well, I'll answer the second question.

Obviously, I don't have to cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products, as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix. And so we actually believe that they can, in a sense, live side by side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily cause -- create issues. I think there's a reality that has set in, in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed, and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real and is probably going to continue to either compete with more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors. But first on ESPN Plus, I realized when I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, ""Well, then, what are they?"" and we haven't been specific. I can only tell you that we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good. We had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would achieve, from the beginning, in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually, we've added nicely to that product offering. Boxing is probably the primary example, but there's been some other good programming as well. And we've been heartened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong, and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product -- I mentioned in my comments we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first 3 weeks. UFC kicks in. Today we announced the inclusion of the very attractive Italian soccer league, Serie A. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN Plus, which is exciting. And then, of course, as the season unfolds, the next baseball season and the NHL season. MLS, there'll be regular games from all 3 of those leagues and more and more programming. So we feel really good about how we're positioned, and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for. We still have some opportunities, including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along. I'll give you an example is we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series. And we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days, we believe, as a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. We're -- it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective. And we feel great about it."

And then for Christine, similar to Ben, an accounting question related to streaming service. How do you manage the pay one rights for calendar '19 films from an accounting perspective? Because it'll apply to other factors as well. Does the film division still include pay one revenue in its ultimates for calendar '19 releases when determining film amortization by window?

What we want to do is, we want to make sure, when we launch, that it's viewed as a quality product, that we're serving the fans, particularly of Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars, well, and that the price that we're charging reflects the value that we're delivering. We've mentioned a number of times that we have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game but to be in the quality game. And that's not in any way suggesting that Netflix isn't in the quality game, there's a lot of quality there, but they're also in the high-volume game. And we don't really need to do that. We will fill in, in terms of creating volume, with a significant amount of library content, both movie and television content. And so it's not as though the cupboard's going to be bare, but we want to produce the programming that we're putting on under the right circumstances, which is -- means with the right budget and right timing. It takes time to produce these, particularly to produce them well. There are a number that are already in production. And so -- that we feel good about, ultimately, what we're going to launch with. But I think the way to look at it is to look at it as a service that is focused on those brands. We'll also infuse it with National Geographic product as well when the time is right to do that. We will continue to spend incrementally on the service. We talked about that a fair amount. But we will always do so, again, with the knowledge that because of the specificity of these brands and the uniqueness of them that we don't have to be in the absolute volume game. We have to put enough on to make sense from a value -- a price-to-value relationship perspective."

So you've listed now a couple of times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service. I guess, my question is, pretty much every brand you listed, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners. So for instance, I'm thinking about Star Wars. The movies are either on Netflix or even on Turner cable syndication in the States. Marvel movies are on Starz or Netflix, that sort of thing. So I guess, my question is, can you just confirm that when you launch, a whole bunch of those historical products associated with those brands, I guess, will not be on your service? It doesn't sound like. In fact, there's some scenario where there's no Star Wars old movies at all, maybe. I'd love a comment on that. I might be wrong because I don't know the exact carve-outs.

The volume of the product that's on. But it's also one of the reasons why we're creating a fair amount of original content for it as well, original Star Wars series, original Pixar series, original Marvel series and so on, and some original films as well, because it's clear that, from a library perspective, while there's certainly a lot of volume, the recent studio slate will not fully be available at any one time because of the existing deals and it would take time for those rights, ultimately, to revert back to us.

As Bob mentioned, college football, we are getting into that season and the match-ups are all getting out in the marketplace, and we expect the ad revenue to reflect that. Just looking back at third quarter, I do want to make the note that the difference in the number of NBA playoffs and final games, when you adjust for that -- we had one fewer final. We had 2 fewer semi-finals, but we had the benefit of 3 additional conference finals. When you net all that out, ESPN's ad sales in 3Q would have been roughly similar to the prior year."

Adjusted for comparability, earnings per share were up 38% for the quarter and 24% for the year. Christine will give you details about our performance in a few minutes. My remarks are focused on 2 of our biggest priorities in fiscal 2019. The successful completion and integration of our 21st Century Fox acquisition and the further development of our DTC business, which includes adding new content and subscribers to ESPN Plus, gaining majority stake in Hulu and launching our highly anticipated Disney-branded service late next year. 
With regard to our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we just received EU regulatory approval this week, another major milestone in the process, and we're optimistic about securing the necessary approvals from the territories that remain. Last June, we estimated it could take up to 12 months for the transaction to close, but we are increasingly optimistic it will be meaningfully earlier than that. As I have said numerous times, the value of the portfolio of recognized brands and world-class content we're acquiring is impressive as is the wealth of executive talent at 21st Century Fox, many of whom will hold key positions in the combined company. 
Upon completion of the acquisition, Peter Rice will be Chairman Walt Disney television reporting to me and will also serve as cochair of our Media Networks group, along with ESPN President, Jimmy [indiscernible]. Dana Walden, John Landgraf and Gary Knell will also be joining us in leadership roles reporting to Peter. Additionally, a number of 21st Century Fox studio executives will be joining Alan Horn's team at Disney Studio Entertainment, including Emma Watts at 20th Century Fox, Nancy and Steve at Fox Searchlight and Elizabeth at Fox 2000. 
As I mentioned earlier, DTC continues to be one of our top priorities. Our strategic purchase of BAMTech allowed us to enter this arena quickly and effectively, as evidenced by our successful launch of ESPN Plus 6 months ago. More than 1 million users have already subscribed, and we continue to see impressive growth. Sports fans are attracted to an ever-growing number of live events, including Top Rank Boxing, Major League Baseball, the NHL, MLS and Italy's Serie A soccer, along with thousands of college sports events including 200 college football games this season, along with more than 2,900 college basketball match ups, including almost 550 in November alone. We'll add UFC to the ESPN Plus line up, starting in January. 
The platform also features exclusive original content, including the groundbreaking series in detail offering Kobe Bryant's insight into the NBA. And as you may have seen, Peyton Manning is now writing and hosting an NFL version. The early growth trajectory of ESPN Plus is very encouraging, and we believe it bodes very well for our overall global DTC strategy. 
Our Disney-branded service, which we're officially calling Disney Plus will be in the U.S. market late next year, offering a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content, along with unprecedented access to our incredible library of film and television content, including all of our new theatrical releases starting with the 2019 Slate. We've already announced the robust pipeline of Disney Plus original content currently in production, including the Man DeLorean, the world's first live action Star Wars series written and produced by Jon Favreau. 
As you know, John launched the Marvel cinematic universe with Iron Man, he also redefined live actions story-telling in Jungle Book and he's doing it again with Lion King. So we're thrilled to have him creating content for this new platform. In addition to putting together a great story and strong cast, John's got an unbelievable collection of talent behind the camera, including, the Director of Thor Ragnarok. 
Over a decade ago, Disney Channel's High School Musical was a real success, and we're building on that success and reimagining the franchise for a new generation with a live-action Disney Plus series. Animation will also be an integral part of Disney Plus. The service will be the exclusive home of the next season of the popular Star Wars animated series, Clone Wars, as well as the new series based on Pixar's beloved Monsters Inc. franchise. The Disney Plus platform is also a perfect home for documentary series that will allow us to pull the curtain back and give people a behind-the-scenes perspective. 
We've got several docu series currently in production, including an exclusive unprecedented look at Walt Disney Imagineering, featuring stories we've never really told before and images we've never shared. Our studios are also creating a robust slate of original films, exclusively for Disney Plus, including Noel starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, a live-action version of Lady and the Tramp and Togo, an adventure starring 3-time Oscar nominee, Willem Defoe. We're also currently developing a live-action Marvel series about Loki, starring Tom Huddleston, playing the character he's made so famous. And we're working on a second live action Star Wars series, a prequel to Rogue One, starring Diego Luna. 
As with ESPN Plus, the launch of Disney Plus will be just the starting point. We plan to continually elevate experience, enhance the value to consumers with a custom pipeline of exclusive new content as we move forward. I visited BAMTech last week and saw an early prototype of the app, which will feature elegant navigation, personalization and content segmented primarily by our core brands, namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will brand library product with original content under these 5 brand banners, and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition. The planning and investor conference in April to provide more insight into our DTC strategy, including a first look at Disney Plus, along with some of the content we're creating for it. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our Q4 performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by St",1367,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, which also were significant contributors to the 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018. 
It was a very active year for the company on a number of front, and these financial results demonstrate a continued focus on execution of our strategy while we invest to position the company for long-term growth. Our Studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal fiscal year. Higher Studio results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to growth in operating income from our worldwide theatrical business, and to a lesser extent, lower film impairments and growth in TV SVOD distribution and home entertainment. 
Higher worldwide theatrical results reflect the strong performance of Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp, compared to Cars 3 and no Marvel title in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, the Studio generated a record $3 billion in operating income, surpassing the Studio's previous record of $2.7 billion set in fiscal 2016. Our studio results demonstrate once again that our relentless focus on quality, creative excellence and compelling storytelling can lead to consistently strong financial results. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which reflected a $100 million adverse impact of Hurricane Irma during the fourth quarter last year. Higher operating income at our domestic operation was primarily due to guest spending and attendance growth, partially offset by higher cost, including roughly $55 million related to a special cast member bonus we announced earlier in the year. 
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8% and occupancy was up 1 percentage point to 85%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year while booked rates are up 4%. 
Results at our international operation were comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Total segment operating income margin was up 40 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenues was up 5% in the quarter as a result of growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by approximately a 1 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a 1 point impact from foreign exchange. 
The improving sub-trends continued in the fourth quarter, so we now have 5 consecutive quarters of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting operating income was up meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to higher program sales and growth in affiliate revenue. The increase in program sales was primarily due to the sale of 2 Marvel series versus 1 last year and a sale of Black-ish in the quarter. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. 
Advertising revenue at Broadcasting was comparable to the fourth quarter last year as higher network rate and higher political advertising at our TV stations were offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 35% above upfront levels. Q4 results were lower in the quarter as higher operating income at Disney Channel worldwide and Freeform were more than offset by losses at BAMTech, which are consolidated in our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in September of last year. 
BAMTech's fourth quarter results this year reflect content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform. At ESPN, operating income in the quarter was comparable to Q4 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset primarily by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NFL and college sports programming. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was down 6% in the quarter due to a decrease in average viewership and lower units delivered. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash add sales are pacing up compared to prior year and reflect in part a shift in the timing of the college football semi finals. ESPN will once again air 3 of the new year 6 ball games during the first quarter. However, this year, 2 of those ballgames will be semifinal game, which aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A&E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming, marketing and labor cost, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to asset impairments, which were driven by the write-down of retail store leasehold improvements and lower licensing income, partially offset by lower costs primarily in our games business. 
Given the pending acquisitions of 21st Century Fox, we did not purchase our stock during the fourth quarter. We repurchased a total of 34.6 million shares for $3.6 billion for fiscal 2018. 
Now I would like to discuss some matters pertaining to fiscal 2019. First, as we previously announced, at the end of Q1, we will begin reporting our financial results under a new structure made up of 4 business segments: Media Networks, Park experiences and Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment and direct-to-consumer and international. In early January, we expect to file 3 years of restated financials that will reflect this new segment reporting structure. 
Second, as Bob mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in April, during which we will discuss our direct-to-consumer businesses in more detail as well as provide additional perspective on our company post the 21st Century Fox acquisition, assuming the transaction will have closed by then. And of course, we will webcast that event. 
While our full year fiscal 2019 results will be influenced by the timing of the closing of the Fox acquisition, I want to highlight some items we already know will affect year-over-year comparability. We are extremely enthusiastic about our 2019 slate. We conclude Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, the next Avengers films, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the Lion King. I'll remind you that 2018 was the best year in our studios history. 
We face a particularly challenging comp in the first quarter due to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Given the significant contributions, these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600 million versus 2018. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi also resulted in higher licensing results for the first quarter last year. For the absence of a comparable franchise title this year will weigh on our licensing business in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect cable programming expenses to be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by contractual rate increases for sports rights at ESPN. However, we expect Q1 cable programming expenses to be up 9%, driven by the timing shift of the college football semi finals I mentioned earlier. We will continue to invest in both ESPN Plus and our yet-to-be launched Disney Plus service. The continued ramp up of ESPN Plus, which includes investments in sports rights will have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. We'll have more to say about our overall direct-to-consumer strategy and the aggregate full year financial implications during the Investor Day in April. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and will be more than happy to take your questions."

I know you've got this Investor Day coming, but whatever you're comfortable sharing with us today would be helpful because that's a business that does have some reasonable scale, but does lose money and has multiple products and I wonder if you could fit into your overall worldview. And then on the Disney Plus service, have you guys thought about the theatrical window around Pay One? I mean, seems like an interesting opportunity would be shortening that window and actually bringing films from theatrical release into the Disney Plus experience earlier than the usual 7 or 8 months window. So I'm wondering if you thought about that opportunity or at least the overall theatrical strategy for Disney Plus. Anything you can share there would be great."

So anything we do",551,"Well, first of all, regarding Hulu, as you noted, we'll own 60%, which will give us considerable say in how Hulu is run. But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do at Hulu will be done with an eye toward being fiscally responsible to the other shareholders even though they're minority shareholders. That said, we think that given the success of Hulu so far in terms of subscriber growth and relative brand strength and other things too like demographics, we think there's an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side. And with this acquisition comes not only some great IP, but some excellent talent, particularly on the television side, all this talent in both movies and TV. And we aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original program that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace. I also think Hulu is attractive in many ways. And one I mentioned demographics. If you look at the demographics of the people consuming of network shows in Hulu, if you look at the demographics at the same shows on the network, you'll see we could be at times 20 years younger audience at Hulu. And that's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu in that it is a very strong play for advertisers because it can offer targeted ads, and it has great demos, and it's just a great user experience. The quality of the product meaning the quality of the television programming is quite high. So overall, I think we've got an opportunity to invest more in Hulu, to grow its. I also think there's some pricing elasticity too, notably on the multichannel front and we'll talk about sometime in the near future. I think there's an opportunity to improve or I should say increase our pricing there. And it will focus mostly by the way, on what I'll call general entertainment programming, and we're leave the more family-oriented programming to the Disney Plus app. On theatrical, the question you asked me about the theatrical window, sort offered us if it ain't broke. I know you may think that there's an opportunity, but as noted by the results of our studio in fiscal 2018 and, of course, in the last quarter, we have a studio that is doing extremely well and the formula that is serving us really well in terms of its bottom line. And we're probably going to aim to protect that initial window. And then the other thing that's quite clear to us is that the home video windows, as it's been called that follows the theatrical window also continues to be quite important to us, both the sale of these films digitally as well as physical goods. And I think you'll likely see us protect that as well, although there's going to be a discussion around whether there's an opportunity to move the product from that window to what I'll call the Pay One window maybe a little bit sooner. But not -- we're not looking right now to encroach on the theatrical window."

So what were the trade-offs that you saw by not getting Sky has that affect the Disney Plus rollout?

And so we've seen some nice growth there including, by the way, from Hulu. And I think that we're hopeful that the take up of the digital MVPDs will continue to grow even though I know there's been a lot said about that. I think what I talked about earlier, I think it's from a demographic perspective, these services tend to be very attractive for younger viewers. They're also less expensive, which I think is important even though I think there might be an opportunity for us to take pricing up a bit at Hulu. And the user experience is great. So we're bullish about MVPDs. And with that in mind, we believe that ESPN will benefit nicely from that over the long term. The other thing by the way, that is interesting is that there are some entities out there that have gone to the space notably YouTube that are obviously quite committed to seeing -- to growing their service just look at the World Series and the amount of advertising that was in the World Series for the YouTube service. That suggest to us that we're not the only believer out there, that there are others as well. On the Sky front, look, you can't cry over spilled milk, so to speak, there's nothing we can do about it. We made a bid that we thought was an appropriate bid in terms of what we saw as value to our company. We would have loved to would have Sky both because we believe in the asset, and we thought it would have helped us in terms of introducing a direct-to-consumer service in the European market. But again, only at a price that made sense for us. Without Sky, we're still planning on taking Disney Plus out in Europe. We also plan working with Hulu to introduce Hulu in more international markets as well. It could possibly be that it takes us a little bit longer to penetrate some of these markets, but we believe in the product that we will be launching, and we'll make sure that, that product is tailored for the various European markets, not just because it needs to be -- it needs to satisfy what will be quoted for SVODs in Europe, but also because we think it needs to be locally relevant. And we're going to be selective in terms of the markets that we choose initially, but we believe we're going to win -- that we have a real opportunity there particularly when it comes to the Disney brand and service, which is going to feature Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney, of course, and then National Geographic. Those are all very attractive brands in those markets, and that's going to make that product extremely unique and in demand."

But we still believe very, very bullishly in not only the business that we built, but the business that we can continue to invest in. We opened up a new land since we opened Shanghai this past year, we opened Toy Story Land, and we have plans for continued expansion, both attractions and ultimately hotels, but we haven't made any specific announcements about that yet, but we still feel great about that market for our theme park business. And then on the integration front, I think if you look at our company's results over the last, let's say, 5 years. You've seen incredibly impressive results at Parks and Resorts and our studio. Businesses that not only are doing well, but we've continue to grow year after year after year. And if you look at our television business overall, obviously, ESPN has done well, but they've had some issues in terms of distribution or subs. The rest of our television business has performance has been relatively modest over that period of time. As we look at this acquisition, not only does it come with great IP, but the television business that we're buying is we think very, very attractive, not just in the United States, but across the world if you factor in Star in India and the rest of Asia, and you factor in Europe, where they have a substantially greater footprint of channels than we do, which by the way, may ultimately end up helping us with content and distribution when it comes to the direct-to-consumer business. What we also get is a great television studio that's been run by Dana Walden and others, and what we aim to do there is we aim to create a combined entity, a very, very successful television studio that will be aimed at creating product, not only for the traditional businesses that we're in, namely the channels and the network but also for our direct-to-consumer services. So there's a very, very important strategic play here in terms of what the studio and the people that will be running the studio can do. And then, of course, we bring -- we've made these announcements. We're bringing Peter Rice in, we bring John Landgraf in. We're bringing in executives that not only have a lot of experience, but a lot of success under their belts on the television side and the ability to not only strengthen the existing Disney television businesses, but to create a television business that is basically designed to service both, I'll call it the present as well as the future of the combined entity."

And then just a follow-up on the domestic parks. How should we think about or frame the opening of the Star Wars Land, I think both in Anaheim and Orlando when we think about drivers to the parks next year or next calendar year, I should say? I'm assuming bigger than Pandora just as big as Cars Land. Any color on that would be great."

And so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland clearly it's the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand, and we're going to have some interesting challenges in our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have. And then in Florida, we have 4 parks, Star Wars Land there is going into the Studio's park, the Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago, and we aim to actually grow the attendance to that part, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is in this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases, that will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses. On the first question about ESPN Plus, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all, we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest from users and subscriptions, which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easy to navigate, easy to use and very high quality in terms of the quality of a live streaming. And we put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events, and we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which is soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers, and we are putting on by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November. And then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest -- first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform and the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights as thereafter 20 will be on an exclusive to this product. So I would say, we're kind of just in the early innings to use the sports analogy of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're always in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective. And last week, I was in New York at BAMTech, and they gave me a great presentation on personalization/customization, the technology that they've [indiscernible] they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard, because we know there's a huge opportunity there given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories. So I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content, and we will add more technology features. And then we haven't really begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier, we talked about -- actually it was Christine McCarthy, as we talk about putting more college sports on, the affinity the people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary, and we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges who may not be able to find sports from their college on local and national sports networks, but we're going to serve them well on this platform."

Then after the deal closes and after we have the 60% ownership, we'll meet with Hulu management team and the board and discuss what the opportunities are in terms of both global growth and investing more in content. But that's something that we have to do after the deal closes. The second question, what needs to be done on the BAMTech side. Really, very little in the sense that I mean, there's a lot that needs to be done, but it's being done. I saw an iteration of the app last week and I was very impressed with it. It's not quiet in ready for prime time because it's still being iterated, but it will be elegant, it will be very brand-centric, which we believe add navigational features that typically don't exist in other platforms, namely that there'll be segments under the brand program segments under the brands Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and the National Geographic. So we think there'll be an elegance to it and ease of use, and we're a super serve the most ardent fans of those 5 different brands by creating experience or in environments that are more tailored customized and personalized of those brands. We have obviously a very stable product when it comes to live streaming as I said earlier that's been tested already on the sports front. We believe that our ability to both attract and ultimately retain consumers is strong from a technology perspective, and now obviously, we have to aid that effort with programming. And I'd say right now, aside from the development that's being done at BAMTech on the app itself, mostly what's going on at the company on the Disney Plus side is ramping up our production and continuing to commit to new product. We mentioned a few today on the call, Marvel series specifically, another Star Wars series and a number of movies and docu series, and this activity across the board in our company in terms of increased production investment specifically for this app, and it will take some time obviously to see the kind of scale we're going to need on the steady-state because it takes time to make these products particularly given the high production values that they represent. But besides that, we think we're in great shape. We have a game plan in place to bring the product to market. We hope to show you a fair amount about the app, the app itself and some of the programming and some of our strategies including our pricing strategy when we have the investors meeting there, we talked about having in sometime in April on the call earlier."

We think we're quickly get very complicated if we aggregate the content that was really owned fully by other entities. And we think we'll have -- we have enough there right now, we'll be able to continue to license more. On the time line, when we first announced this deal in December of '17 and then when we close the deal again where we made the deal later in the year, we talked about a time line first that will be 12 to 18 months and then roughly, I think we talked about 12 months from what was June. And since then, we gave approval in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department and then this week with the EU, those are 2 very significant markets. And for an acquisition of this size and its complexity, we assume that it would take a certain amount of time for the regulatory authorities to consider all the various marketplace issues that they had to consider. And we are optimistic today because we have been able to gain approval not only in those 2 but in multiple other markets and countries around the world. We still have a few important countries to go. We're well into those processes and based on what we know, we were able to say earlier on the call that we've got a more optimistic about our ability to close much earlier than the June time frame that we talked about. And then I think it's just best to leave it at that because frankly, we don't know specifically when it will be."

And again, one of the reasons why we announced the structure that we announced is because we believe that's the best structure for us to execute, not just the strategic plans that we have but to continue to drive growth and results at the traditional businesses. And then on the first question about what I'll call third-party rights or existing agreements, there has been some reporting about this that we're in the market seeking to amend the terms of some of those agreements.

There was a note in the press release saying that there's actually a positive source of profit growth year-over-year from the factors including decreased marketing spending, decreased programming spending, increased sales content, so I think it might have been to Hulu among others. Is that something we should expect to see as a trend as you think about the role of those linear kids networks with the pending launch of Disney Plus? And just more broadly, how do you think about the role in the future of those linear kids networks? The second part of the question, make it quicker, we had the broadcast network, ABC. I think it's fair to say it is the least amount of sports content among the big 4 broadcast networks obviously it's related to the ESPN. Do you think it's important to have ABC maybe participate more strongly in sports generally as you think about the future of the broadcast network business?"

We also felt that we needed to service ESPN with the kind of programming necessary to drive subscriptions, both in terms of the price as well as the number of subscribers. And it was the right thing to do. ESPN will also be called upon to use some of its licensing capabilities to serve as ESPN Plus. So while I think that there were some sacrifices associated with that, we think it was the right thing to do for the company. Going forward, we haven't made any decisions as to whether we would put more sports onto ABC or back on to ABC. I imagine we'll be opportunistic about it if the opportunities exist, we will consider it. But right now, ESPN, ESPN Plus are the priorities. In terms of the Disney Channel comment and the linear networks, we're in linear television in a number of different fronts, and we're going to be more of it once this deal closes, both here and the United States and around the world when you consider FX and National Geographic, and you have Freeform and ABC and Disney Channel, of course, ESPN. And we don't intend to get out of those businesses nor do we intend to what I'll call deprioritize them or sacrifice them as we move into this outer space. But we're also realists, and we see what's going on in the marketplace, and we see the growth of new platforms, of program consumption versus channel consumption, of disaggregation and of the potential for disintermediation, which basically means the ability for us to take both our channels and our programming direct-to-consumer. We intend to do what is best for the company over the long run if that means continuing to support the linear channels because we believe in their value to the company from a bottom line perspective, we'll do that. And if we see the opportunity grows more and more to not only invest in, but to move programming over to the direct-to-consumer platforms, we'll do that. We can't, right now, in any way, estimate if that will happen or when it will happen. But we're going to be nimble as I think we've already evidenced by just the fact that we're going into the direct-to-consumer space as aggressively as we're going into it. We're looking at the marketplace. We're seeing disruption, and we're reacting to it hopefully on a timely basis, so we can take advantage of the trends that we're all seeing today in television."

Adjusted for comparability, earnings per share were up 38% for the quarter and 24% for the year. Christine will give you details about our performance in a few minutes. My remarks are focused on 2 of our biggest priorities in fiscal 2019. The successful completion and integration of our 21st Century Fox acquisition and the further development of our DTC business, which includes adding new content and subscribers to ESPN Plus, gaining majority stake in Hulu and launching our highly anticipated Disney-branded service late next year. 
With regard to our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we just received EU regulatory approval this week, another major milestone in the process, and we're optimistic about securing the necessary approvals from the territories that remain. Last June, we estimated it could take up to 12 months for the transaction to close, but we are increasingly optimistic it will be meaningfully earlier than that. As I have said numerous times, the value of the portfolio of recognized brands and world-class content we're acquiring is impressive as is the wealth of executive talent at 21st Century Fox, many of whom will hold key positions in the combined company. 
Upon completion of the acquisition, Peter Rice will be Chairman of Walt Disney television, reporting to me, and will also serve as cochair of our Media Networks group, along with ESPN President, Jimmy Pitaro. Dana Walden, John Landgraf and Gary Knell will also be joining us in leadership roles reporting to Peter. Additionally, a number of 21st Century Fox studio executives will be joining Alan Horn's team at Disney Studio Entertainment, including Emma Watts at 20th Century Fox, Nancy Utley and Steve Gilula at Fox Searchlight, and Elizabeth Gabler at Fox 2000. 
As I mentioned earlier, DTC continues to be one of our top priorities. Our strategic purchase of BAMTech allowed us to enter this arena quickly and effectively, as evidenced by our successful launch of ESPN Plus 6 months ago. More than 1 million users have already subscribed, and we continue to see impressive growth. Sports fans are attracted to an ever-growing number of live events, including Top Rank Boxing, Major League Baseball, the NHL, MLS and Italy's Serie A soccer, along with thousands of college sports events, including 200 college football games this season along with more than 2,900 college basketball match ups, including almost 550 in November alone. We'll add UFC to the ESPN Plus line up, starting in January. 
The platform also features exclusive original content, including the groundbreaking series, Detail, offering Kobe Bryant's insight into the NBA. And as you may have seen, Peyton Manning is now writing and hosting an NFL version. The early growth trajectory of ESPN Plus is very encouraging, and we believe it bodes very well for our overall global DTC strategy. 
Our Disney-branded service, which we're officially calling Disney Plus, will be in the U.S. market late next year, offering a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content, along with unprecedented access to our incredible library of film and television content, including all of our new theatrical releases starting with the 2019 Slate. We've already announced the robust pipeline of Disney Plus original content currently in production, including the Mandalorian, the world's first live action Star Wars series written and produced by Jon Favreau. 
As you know, John launched the Marvel cinematic universe with Iron Man. He also redefined live actions story-telling in Jungle Book and he's doing it again with Lion King. So we're thrilled to have him creating content for this new platform. In addition to putting together a great story and strong cast, John's got an unbelievable collection of talent behind the camera, including Taika Waititi, the Director of Thor: Ragnarok. 
Over a decade ago, Disney Channel's High School Musical was a real success, and we're building on that success and reimagining the franchise for a new generation with a live-action Disney Plus series. Animation will also be an integral part of Disney Plus. This service will be the exclusive home of the next season of the popular Star Wars animated series, Clone Wars, as well as a new series based on Pixar's beloved Monsters, Inc. franchise. The Disney Plus platform is also a perfect home for a documentary series that will allow us to pull the curtain back and give people a behind-the-scenes perspective. 
We've got several docu series currently in production, including an exclusive unprecedented look at Walt Disney Imagineering, featuring stories we've never really told before and images we've never shared. Our studios are also creating a robust slate of original films exclusively for Disney Plus, including Noel starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, a live-action version of Lady and the Tramp and Togo, an adventure starring 3-time Oscar nominee, Willem Dafoe. We're also currently developing a live-action Marvel series about Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston, playing the character he's made so famous. And we're working on a second live action Star Wars series, a prequel to Rogue One, starring Diego Luna. 
As with ESPN Plus, the launch of Disney Plus will just be the starting point. We plan to continually elevate the experience and enhance the value to consumers with a constant pipeline of exclusive new content as we move forward. 
I visited BAMTech last week and saw an early prototype of the app, which will feature elegant navigation, personalization and content, segmented primarily by our core brands, namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will brand library products with original content under these 5 brand banners, and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition. We're planning an investor conference in April to provide more insight into our DTC strategy, including a first look at Disney Plus, along with some of the content we're creating for it. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our Q4 performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, driven by S",1368,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, driven by Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, which also were significant contributors to the 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018. 
It was a very active year for the company on a number of fronts, and these financial results demonstrate a continued focus on execution of our strategy while we invest to position the company for long-term growth. Our Studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal fiscal year. Higher Studio results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to growth in operating income from our worldwide theatrical business, and to a lesser extent, lower film impairments and growth in TV SVOD distributions and home entertainment. 
Higher worldwide theatrical results reflect the strong performance of Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp, compared to Cars 3 and no Marvel title in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, the Studio generated a record $3 billion in operating income, surpassing the Studio's previous record of $2.7 billion set in fiscal 2016. Our studio results demonstrate once again that our relentless focus on quality, creative excellence and compelling storytelling can lead to consistently strong financial results. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which reflected a $100 million adverse impact of Hurricane Irma during the fourth quarter last year. Higher operating income at our domestic operation was primarily due to guest spending and attendance growth, partially offset by higher cost, including roughly $55 million related to a special cast member bonus we announced earlier in the year. 
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8% and occupancy was up 1 percentage point to 85%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year while booked rates are up 4%. 
Results at our international operations were comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Total segment operating income margin was up 40 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenues was up 5% in the quarter as a result of growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by approximately a 1 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a 1 point impact from foreign exchange. 
The improving sub-trends continued in the fourth quarter, so we've now had 5 consecutive quarters of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting operating income was up meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to higher program sales and growth in affiliate revenue. The increase in program sales was primarily due to the sale of 2 Marvel series versus 1 last year and a sale of Black-ish in the quarter. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. 
Advertising revenue at Broadcasting was comparable to the fourth quarter last year as higher network rates and higher political advertising at our TV stations were offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 35% above upfront levels. Q4 results were lower in the quarter as higher operating income at Disney Channel worldwide and Freeform were more than offset by losses at BAMTech, which are consolidated in our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in September of last year. 
BAMTech's fourth quarter results this year reflect content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform. At ESPN, operating income in the quarter was comparable to Q4 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset primarily by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NFL and college sports programming. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was down 6% in the quarter due to a decrease in average viewership and lower units delivered. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year and reflect, in part, a shift in the timing of the college football semi finals. ESPN will once again air 3 of the new year 6 ball games during the first quarter. However, this year, 2 of those ball games will be semifinal games, which aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A&E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming, marketing and labor cost, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to asset impairments, which were driven by the write-down of retail store leasehold improvements and lower licensing income, partially offset by lower costs, primarily in our games business. 
Given the pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we did not purchase our stock during the fourth quarter. We repurchased a total of 34.6 million shares for $3.6 billion for fiscal 2018. 
Now I would like to discuss some matters pertaining to fiscal 2019. First, as we previously announced, at the end of Q1, we will begin reporting our financial results under a new structure made up of 4 business segments: Media Networks, Parks experiences and Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment and direct-to-consumer and international. In early January, we expect to file 3 years of restated financials that will reflect this new segment reporting structure. 
Second, as Bob mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in April, during which we will discuss our direct-to-consumer businesses in more detail as well as provide additional perspective on our company post the 21st Century Fox acquisition, assuming the transaction will have closed by then. And of course, we will webcast that event. 
While our full year fiscal 2019 results will be influenced by the timing of the closing of the Fox acquisition, I want to highlight some items we already know will affect year-over-year comparability. We are extremely enthusiastic about our 2019 slate, which includes Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, the next Avengers film, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the Lion King. I'll remind you that 2018 was the best year in our studio's history. 
We face a particularly challenging comp in the first quarter due to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Given the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600 million versus 2018. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi also resulted in higher licensing results for the first quarter last year. So the absence of a comparable franchise title this year will weigh on our licensing business in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect cable programming expenses to be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by contractual rate increases for sports rights at ESPN. However, we expect Q1 cable programming expenses to be up 9%, driven by the timing shift of the college football semi finals I mentioned earlier. 
We will continue to invest in both ESPN Plus and our yet-to-be launched Disney Plus service. The continued ramp up of ESPN Plus, which includes investments in sports rights will have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. We'll have more to say about our overall direct-to-consumer strategy and the aggregate full year financial implications during the Investor Day in April. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

I know you've got this Investor Day coming, but whatever you're comfortable sharing with us today would be helpful because that's a business that does have some reasonable scale, but does lose money and has multiple products, and I wonder if you could fit into your overall worldview. And then on the Disney Plus service, have you guys thought about the theatrical window around pay one? I mean, one of the things that might -- that seems like an interesting opportunity would be shortening that window and actually bringing films from theatrical release into the Disney Plus experience earlier than the usual 7 or 8 months window. So I'm wondering if you were -- if you've thought about that opportunity or at least the overall theatrical strategy for Disney Plus. Anything you can share there would be great."

But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do",560,"Well, first of all, regarding Hulu, as you noted, we'll own 60%, which will give us considerable say in how Hulu is run. But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do with Hulu will be done with an eye toward being fiscally responsible to the other shareholders even though they're minority shareholders. That said, we think that given the success of Hulu so far in terms of subscriber growth and relative brand strength, and other things too like demographics, we think there's an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side. And with this acquisition comes not only some great IP, but some excellent talent, particularly on the television side, all this talent in both movies and TV. And we aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original program that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace. I also think Hulu is attractive in many ways. And one I mentioned, demographics. If you look at the demographics of the people consuming off-network shows in Hulu, and when you look at the demographics of the same shows on the network, you'll see what could be at times 20 years younger audience at Hulu. And that's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu in that it is a very strong play for advertisers because it can offer targeted ads, and it has great demos, and it's just a great user experience. The quality of the product, meaning the quality of this -- of the television programming is quite high. So overall, I think we've got an opportunity to invest more in Hulu, to grow its subs. I also think there's some pricing elasticity too, but notably on the multichannel front and we'll talk about sometime in the near future. I think there's an opportunity to improve or I should say, increase our pricing there. And it will focus mostly by the way, on what I'll call general entertainment programming, and we'll leave the more family-oriented programming to the Disney Plus app. On the theatrical -- the question you asked me about the theatrical window, sort of with us if it ain't broke. I know you may think that there's an opportunity, but as noted by the results of our studio in fiscal 2018 and, of course, in the last quarter, we have a studio that is doing extremely well and a formula that is serving us really well in terms of its bottom line. And we're probably going to aim to protect that initial window. And then the other thing that's quite clear to us is that the home video windows, as it's been called that follows the theatrical window, also continues to be quite important to us, both the sale of these films in digitally as well as physical goods. And I think you'll likely see us protect that as well, although there's going to be a discussion around whether there's an opportunity to move the product from that window to what I'll call the Pay One window maybe a little bit sooner. But not -- we're not looking right now to encroach on the theatrical window."

So what were the trade-offs that you saw by not getting Sky? Has that affect the Disney Plus rollout? And then on ESPN, as you know, in the past 3 years we, focused on the ESPN and subscriber losses and now you're trending the right way. What do you think is driving this improvement in subscriber trend? And I think you have half a year of fair deals coming due the next year or so.

And so we've seen some nice growth there, including, by the way, from Hulu. And I think that we're hopeful that the take up of the digital MVPDs will continue to grow even though I know there's been a lot said about that. I think what I talked about earlier, I think it's from a demographic perspective, these services tend to be very attractive for younger viewers. They're also less expensive, which I think is important even though I think there might be an opportunity for us to take pricing up a bit at Hulu. And the user experience is great. So we're bullish about the MVPDs. And with that in mind, we believe that ESPN will benefit nicely from that over the long term. The other thing by the way, that is interesting is that there are some entities out there that have gone to the space, notably YouTube, that are obviously quite committed to seeing -- to growing their service. Just look at the World Series and the amount of advertising that was in the World Series for the YouTube service. That suggest to us that we're not the only believer out there, that there are others as well. On the Sky front, I'm not -- look, you can't cry over spilled milk, so to speak, there's nothing we can do about it. We made a bid that we thought was an appropriate bid in terms of what we saw as value to our company. We would have loved to would have had Sky, both because we believe in the asset, and we thought it could have helped us in terms of introducing a direct-to-consumer service in the European market. But again, only at a price that made sense for us. Without Sky, we're still planning on taking Disney Plus out in Europe. We also plan working with Hulu to introduce Hulu in more international markets as well. It could possibly be that it takes us a little bit longer to penetrate some of these markets, but we believe in the product that we will be launching, and we'll make sure that, that product is tailored for the various European markets, not just because it needs to be -- it needs to satisfy what will be quotas for SVODs in Europe, but also because we think it needs to be locally relevant. And we're going to be selective in terms of the markets that we choose initially, but we believe we're going to win -- that we have a real opportunity there, particularly when it comes to the Disney branded service, which is going to feature Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney, of course, and then National Geographic. Those are all very attractive brands in those markets, and that's going to make that product extremely unique and in-demand."

Some time mid to late fiscal 2018, we saw some softness in the tourism market in China, not -- just by the way, not just for us, but across the board. And we basically put in place some discounting, some lower pricing to continue to drive attendance during what we saw as somewhat of a downturn. But we didn't necessarily think it was permanent. We've subsequently taken a lot of those promotions or those price discounting off and the results actually have been good. But I think what you'll be seeing in China is maybe a slight reduction in consumer confidence and that's having an impact on the business somewhat. But we still believe very, very, very bullishly in, not only the business that we built, but the business that we can continue to invest in. We opened up a new land since we opened Shanghai this past year. We opened Toy Story Land, and we have plans for continued expansion, both attractions and ultimately hotels, but we haven't made any specific announcements about that yet, but we still feel great about that market for our theme park business. And then on the integration front, I think if you look at our company's results over the last, I would say -- let's say, 5 years. You've seen incredibly impressive results at Parks and Resorts and our studio. Businesses that, not only are doing well, but we've continued to grow year after year after year. And if you look at our television business overall, obviously, ESPN has done well, but they've had some issues in terms of distribution or subs. The rest of our television businesses performance has been relatively modest over that period of time. As we look at this acquisition, not only does it come with great IP, but the television business that we're buying is, we think, very, very attractive, not just in the United States, but across the world if you factor in Star in India and the rest of Asia, and you factor in Europe, where they have substantially greater footprint of channels than we do, which by the way, may ultimately end up helping us with content and distribution when it comes to the direct-to-consumer business. What we also get is a great television studio that's been run by Dana Walden and others, and what we aim to do there is we aim to create a combined entity, a very, very successful television studio that will be aimed at creating product, not only for the traditional businesses that we're in, namely the channels and the network, but also for our direct-to-consumer services. So there's a very, very important strategic play here in terms of what the studio and the people that will be running the studio can do. And then, of course, we bring -- we've made these announcements. We're bringing Peter Rice in, we bring John Landgraf in. We're bringing in executives that not only have a lot of experience, but a lot of success under their belts on the television side and the ability to not only strengthen the existing Disney television businesses, but to create a television business that is basically designed to service both the, I'll call it, the present as well as the future of the combined entity."

And so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland, clearly, it's the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand, and we think we're going to have some interesting challenges on our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have. And then in Florida, we have 4 parks. Star Wars Land there is going into the Studio's park, the Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago, and we aim to actually grow the attendance to that park, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is in this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases, they will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses. On the first question about ESPN Plus, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all, we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest in -- from users and subscriptions, which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easily -- easy-to-navigate, easy-to-use and very high quality in terms of the quality of a live streaming. And we've put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events, and we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which is soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers, and we are putting on, by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November. And then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest -- first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform and the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights as thereafter 20 will be on and exclusive to this product. So I would say, we're kind of just in the early innings to use the sports analogy of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're always in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective. And last week, I was in New York at BAMTech, and they gave me a great presentation on personalization and customization, the technology that they've -- engine that they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard, because we know there's a huge opportunity there given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories. So I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content, and we will add more technology features. And then we haven't really even begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier when we talked about -- actually it was Christine McCarthy, as we talk about putting more college sports on. The affinity that people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary, and we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges who may not be able to find sports from their college on local and national sports networks, but we're going to serve them well on this platform."

And then after the deal closes and after we have the 60% ownership, we'll meet with Hulu management team and the board and discuss what the opportunities are in terms of both global growth and investing more in content. But that's something that we have to do after the deal closes. Your -- the second question, what needs to be done on the BAMTech side? Really, very little in the sense that I mean, there's a lot that needs to be done, but it's being done. I saw an iteration of the app last week and I was very impressed with it. It will -- It's not quiet in ready for prime time because it's still being iterated, but there -- it will be elegant, it will be very brand-centric, which we believe add navigational features that typically don't exist on other platforms, namely that there'll be segments under the brand -- program segments under the brands Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and the National Geographic. So we think there'll be an elegance to it and ease of use, and we're to super serve the most ardent fans of those 5 different brands by creating experience and environments that are more tailored or customized and personalized to those brands. We have obviously a very stable product when it comes to live streaming, as I said earlier. That's been tested already on the sports front. We believe that our ability to both attract and ultimately retain consumers is strong from a technology perspective, and now obviously, we have to aid that effort with programming. And I'd say right now, aside from the development that's being done at BAMTech on the app itself, mostly what's going on at the company on the Disney Plus side is ramping up our production and continuing to commit to new product. We mentioned a few today on the call, a Marvel series specifically, another Star Wars series and a number of movies and docu series, and this activity across the board at our company in terms of increased production investment specifically for this app. And it will take some time, obviously, to see the kind of scale we're going to need on the steady-state because it takes time to make these products, particularly given the high production values that they will represent. But besides that, we think we're in great shape. We have a game plan in place to bring the product to market. And we hope to show you a fair amount about the app, the app itself and some of the programming and some of our strategies, including our pricing strategy when we have the investor meeting that we talked about having in -- sometime in April on the call earlier."

We think it will quickly get very complicated if we aggregate a content that was really owned fully by other entities. And we think we'll have -- we have enough there right now, and we'll be able to continue to license more. On the time line, when we first announced this deal in December of '17 and then when we close the deal again where we made the deal later in the year, we talked about a time line first that will be 12 to 18 months and roughly, I think we talked about 12 months from what was June. And since then, we gained approval in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department, and then this week with the EU, those are 2 very significant markets. And for an acquisition of this size and its complexity, we assume that it would take a certain amount of time for the regulatory authorities to consider all the various marketplace issues that they had to consider. And we are optimistic today because we have been able to gain approval, not only in those 2, but in multiple other markets and countries around the world. We still have a few important countries to go. We're well into those processes and based on what we know, we were able to say earlier on the call that we've gotten more optimistic about our ability to close much earlier than the June time frame that we talked about. And then I think it's just best to leave it at that because frankly, we don't know specifically when it will be."

Do you have active negotiations with those partners just try to get those rights back for Disney Plus? Or is the strategy just to wait for those rights to reach their term? And then secondly on Hulu, you talked about a tighter integration with things like the Fox studio and FX. Should we expect over time that things like FX and Searchlight that Hulu is their exclusive SVOD partner and sort of complete integration there?"

And we're going to have an engine at the company coming from the different entities at the company that will be able to supply Hulu with a lot of high-quality content and more than that they currently have. That is the goal. And again, one of the reasons why we announced the structure that we announced is because we believe that's the best structure for us to execute, not just the strategic plans that we have, but to continue to drive growth and results at the traditional businesses. And then on the first question about what I'll call third-party rights or existing agreements, there has been some reporting about this that we're in the market seeking to amend the terms of some of those agreements.

I actually had a couple of questions I'd really love to ask, all about the linear TV businesses and how they really tell this. So the first one is on the Disney Channels Kids side I guess here in the states. There was a note in the press release saying that there's actually a positive source of profit growth year-over-year from the factors including decreased marketing spending, decreased programming spending, increased sales content, which I think it might have been to Hulu, among others. Is that something we should expect to see as a trend if you think about the role of those linear kids networks with the pending launch of Disney Plus? And just more broadly, how do you think about the role in the future of those linear kids networks? It's hard to make the second part. The second part of the question, made quicker, was just -- we hear about the broadcast network, ABC. I guess, it's fair to say it has the least amount of sports content of -- among the big 4 broadcast networks. Obviously, it's related to the fact that you own ESPN. Do you think it's important to have ABC maybe participate more strongly in sports generally as you think about the future of the broadcast network business?"

We also felt that we needed to service ESPN with the kind of programming necessary to drive subscriptions, both in terms of the price as well as the number of subscribers. And it was the right thing to do. ESPN will also be called upon to use some of its licensing capabilities to serve as ESPN Plus. So while I think that there were some sacrifices associated with it, we think it was the right thing to do for the company. Going forward, we haven't made any decisions as to whether we would put more sports onto ABC or back on to ABC. I imagine we'll be opportunistic about it. If the opportunities exist, we will consider it. But right now, ESPN, ESPN Plus are the priorities. In terms of the Disney Channel comment and the linear networks, we're in linear television in a number of different fronts, and we're going to be in more of it once this deal closes, both here and the United States and around the world when you consider FX and National Geographic, and you add Freeform and ABC and Disney Channel, of course, ESPN. We don't intend to get out of those businesses nor do we intend to what I'll call deprioritize them or sacrifice them as we move into this other space. But we're also realists, and we see what's going on in the marketplace, and we see the growth of new platforms of program consumption versus channel consumption, of disaggregation and of the potential for disintermediation, which basically means the ability for us to take both our channels and our programming direct-to-consumer. We intend to do what is best for the company over the long run if that means continuing to support the linear channels because we believe in their value to the company. From a bottom line perspective, we'll do that. And if we see the opportunity grows more and more to, not only invest in, but to move programming over to the direct-to-consumer platforms, we'll do that. We can't, right now, in any way, estimate if that will happen or when it will happen. But we're going to be nimble as I think we've already evidenced by just the fact that we're going into the direct-to-consumer space as aggressively as we're going into it. We're looking at the marketplace. We're seeing disruption, and we're reacting to it, hopefully on a timely basis, so we can take advantage of the trends that we're all seeing today in television."

Adjusted for comparability, earnings per share were up 38% for the quarter and 24% for the year. Christine will give you details about our performance in a few minutes. My remarks are focused on 2 of our biggest priorities in fiscal 2019: the successful completion and integration of our 21st Century Fox acquisition and the further development of our DTC business, which includes adding new content and subscribers to ESPN Plus, gaining a majority stake in Hulu and launching our highly anticipated Disney-branded service late next year. 
With regard to our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we just received EU regulatory approval this week, another major milestone in the process, and we're optimistic about securing the necessary approvals from the territories that remain. Last June, we estimated it could take up to 12 months for the transaction to close, but we are increasingly optimistic it will be meaningfully earlier than that. As I have said numerous times, the value of the portfolio of recognized brands and world-class content we're acquiring is impressive as is the wealth of executive talent at 21st Century Fox, many of whom will hold key positions in the combined company. 
Upon completion of the acquisition, Peter Rice will be Chairman of Walt Disney Television, reporting to me, and will also serve as cochair of our Media Networks group, along with ESPN President, Jimmy Pitaro. Dana Walden, John Landgraf and Gary Knell will also be joining us in leadership roles reporting to Peter. Additionally, a number of 21st Century Fox studio executives will be joining Alan Horn's team at Disney Studio Entertainment, including Emma Watts at 20th Century Fox, Nancy Utley and Steve Gilula at Fox Searchlight, and Elizabeth Gabler at Fox 2000. 
As I mentioned earlier, DTC continues to be one of our top priorities. Our strategic purchase of BAMTech allowed us to enter this arena quickly and effectively, as evidenced by our successful launch of ESPN Plus 6 months ago. More than 1 million users have already subscribed, and we continue to see impressive growth. Sports fans are attracted to an ever-growing number of live events, including Top Rank Boxing, Major League Baseball, the NHL, MLS and Italy's Serie A soccer, along with thousands of college sports events, including 200 college football games this season along with more than 2,900 college basketball match ups, including almost 550 in November alone. We'll add UFC to the ESPN Plus line up, starting in January. 
The platform also features exclusive original content, including the groundbreaking series, Detail, offering Kobe Bryant's insight into the NBA. And as you may have seen, Peyton Manning is now writing and hosting an NFL version. The early growth trajectory of ESPN Plus is very encouraging, and we believe it bodes very well for our overall global DTC strategy. 
Our Disney-branded service, which we're officially calling Disney Plus, will be in the U.S. market late next year, offering a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content, along with unprecedented access to our incredible library of film and television content, including all of our new theatrical releases starting with the 2019 slate. We've already announced a robust pipeline of Disney Plus original content currently in production, including the Mandalorian, the world's first live action Star Wars series written and produced by Jon Favreau. 
As you know, John launched the Marvel cinematic universe with Iron Man. He also redefined live action story-telling in Jungle Book and he's doing it again with Lion King. So we're thrilled to have him creating content for this new platform. In addition to putting together a great story and strong cast, John's got an unbelievable collection of talent behind the camera, including Taika Waititi, the Director of Thor: Ragnarok. 
Over a decade ago, Disney Channel's High School Musical was a real success, and we're building on that success and reimagining the franchise for a new generation with a live-action Disney Plus series. Animation will also be an integral part of Disney Plus. This service will be the exclusive home of the next season of the popular Star Wars animated series, Clone Wars, as well as a new series based on Pixar's beloved Monsters, Inc. franchise. The Disney Plus platform is also a perfect home for a documentary series that will allow us to pull the curtain back and give people a behind-the-scenes perspective. 
We've got several docuseries currently in production, including an exclusive unprecedented look at Walt Disney Imagineering, featuring stories we've never really told before and images we've never shared. Our studios are also creating a robust slate of original films exclusively for Disney Plus, including Noelle starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, a live-action version of Lady and the Tramp, and Togo, an adventure starring 3-time Oscar nominee, Willem Dafoe. We're also currently developing a live-action Marvel series about Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston, playing the character he's made so famous. And we're working on a second live action Star Wars series, a prequel to Rogue One, starring Diego Luna. 
As with ESPN Plus, the launch of Disney Plus will just be the starting point. We plan to continually elevate the experience and enhance the value to consumers with a constant pipeline of exclusive new content as we move forward. 
I visited BAMTech last week and saw an early prototype of the app, which will feature elegant navigation, personalization and content, segmented primarily by our core brands, namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will blend library products with original content under these 5 brand banners, and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition. We're planning an investor conference in April to provide more insight into our DTC strategy, including a first look at Disney Plus, along with some of the content we're creating for it. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our Q4 performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"
191564,585399496,1602756,"The Walt Disney Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, driven by S",1369,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, driven by Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, which also were significant contributors to the 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018. 
It was a very active year for the company on a number of fronts, and these financial results demonstrate a continued focus on execution of our strategy while we invest to position the company for long-term growth. Our Studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal fiscal year. Higher Studio results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to growth in operating income from our worldwide theatrical business, and to a lesser extent, lower film impairments and growth in TV SVOD distribution and home entertainment. 
Higher worldwide theatrical results reflect the strong performance of Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp, compared to Cars 3 and no Marvel title in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, the Studio generated a record $3 billion in operating income, surpassing the Studio's previous record of $2.7 billion set in fiscal 2016. Our studio results demonstrate once again that a relentless focus on quality, creative excellence and compelling storytelling can lead to consistently strong financial results. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which reflected a $100 million adverse impact of Hurricane Irma during the fourth quarter last year. Higher operating income at our domestic operation was primarily due to guest spending and attendance growth, partially offset by higher costs, including roughly $55 million related to a special cast member bonus we announced earlier in the year. 
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8% and occupancy was up 1 percentage point to 85%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year while booked rates are up 4%. 
Results at our international operations were comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Total segment operating income margin was up 40 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable and a lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter as a result of growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by approximately a 1 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a 1 point impact from foreign exchange. 
The improving sub-trends continued in the fourth quarter, so we've now had 5 consecutive quarters of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting operating income was up meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to higher program sales and growth in affiliate revenue. The increase in program sales was primarily due to the sale of 2 Marvel series versus 1 last year and a sale of Black-ish in the quarter. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. 
Advertising revenue at Broadcasting was comparable to the fourth quarter last year as higher network rates and higher political advertising at our TV stations were offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 35% above upfront levels. Cable results were lower in the quarter as higher operating income at Disney Channel worldwide and Freeform were more than offset by losses at BAMTech, which are consolidated in our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in September of last year. 
BAMTech's fourth quarter results this year reflect content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform. At ESPN, operating income in the quarter was comparable to Q4 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset primarily by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NFL and college sports programming. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was down 6% in the quarter due to a decrease in average viewership and lower units delivered. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year and reflect, in part, a shift in the timing of the college football semi finals. ESPN will once again air 3 of the new year's 6 bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year, 2 of those bowl games will be semifinal games, which aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A&E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming, marketing and labor cost, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to asset impairments, which were driven by the write-down of retail store leasehold improvements and lower licensing income, partially offset by lower costs, primarily in our games business. 
Given the pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we did not purchase our stock during the fourth quarter. We repurchased a total of 34.6 million shares for $3.6 billion for fiscal 2018. 
Now I would like to discuss some matters pertaining to fiscal 2019. First, as we previously announced, at the end of Q1, we will begin reporting our financial results under a new structure made up of 4 business segments: Media Networks, Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment, and Direct-to-Consumer and International. In early January, we expect to file 3 years of restated financials that will reflect this new segment reporting structure. 
Second, as Bob mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in April, during which we will discuss our direct-to-consumer businesses in more detail as well as provide additional perspective on our company post the 21st Century Fox acquisition, assuming the transaction will have closed by then. And of course, we will webcast that event. 
While our full year fiscal 2019 results will be influenced by the timing of the closing of the Fox acquisition, I want to highlight some items we already know will affect year-over-year comparability. We are extremely enthusiastic about our 2019 slate, which includes Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, the next Avengers film, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the Lion King. I'll remind you that 2018 was the best year in our studio's history. 
We face a particularly challenging comp in the first quarter due to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Given the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600 million versus 2018. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi also resulted in higher licensing results for the first quarter last year. So the absence of a comparable franchise title this year will weigh on our licensing business in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect cable programming expenses to be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by contractual rate increases for sports rights at ESPN. However, we expect Q1 cable programming expenses to be up 9%, driven by the timing shift of the college football semi finals I mentioned earlier. 
We will continue to invest in both ESPN Plus and our yet-to-be launched Disney Plus service. The continued ramp up of ESPN Plus, which includes investments in sports rights will have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. We'll have more to say about our overall direct-to-consumer strategy and the aggregate full year financial implications during the Investor Day in April. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

And then on the Disney Plus service, have you guys thought about the theatrical window around PayOne? I mean, one of the things that might -- that seems like an interesting opportunity would be shortening that window and actually bringing films from theatrical release into the Disney Plus experience earlier than the usual 7 or 8 month window. So I'm wondering if you were -- if you've thought about that opportunity or at least the overall theatrical strategy for Disney Plus. Anything you can share there would be great."

But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do with Hulu will be done with an eye toward being fiscally responsible to the other shareholders even though they're minority shareholders. That said, we think that given the success of Hulu so far in terms of subscriber growth and relative brand strength, and other things too like demographics, we think there's an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side. And with this acquisition comes not only some great IP, but some excellent talent, particularly on the television side, although there's talent in both movies and TV. And we aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original programming that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace. I also think Hulu is attractive in many ways. And one I mentioned, demographics. If you look at the demographics of the people consuming off-network shows in Hulu, and you look at the demographics of the same shows on the network, you'll see what could be at times a 20 years' younger audience at Hulu. And that's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu, in that it is a very strong play for advertisers because it can offer targeted ads, and it has great demos, and it's just a great user experience. The quality of the product, meaning the quality of this -- of the television programming is quite high. So overall, I think we've got an opportunity to invest more in Hulu, to grow its subs. I also think there's some pricing elasticity too, but notably on the multichannel front and we'll talk about sometime in the near future. I think there's an opportunity to improve or I should say, increase our pricing there. And it will focus mostly, by the way, on what I'll call general entertainment programming, and we'll leave the more family-oriented programming to the Disney Plus app. On the theatrical -- the question you asked me about the theatrical window, sort of with us if it ain't broke. I know you may think that there's an opportunity, but as noted by the results of our studio in fiscal 2018 and, of course, in the last quarter, we have a studio that is doing extremely well and a formula that is serving us really well in terms of its bottom line. And we're probably going to aim to protect that initial window. And then the other thing that's quite clear to us is that the home video window, as it's been called, that follows the theatrical window, also continues to be quite important to us, both the sale of these films in digitally as well as physical goods. And I think you'll likely see us protect that as well, although there's going to be a discussion around whether there's an opportunity to move the product from that window to what I'll call the Pay One window maybe a little bit sooner. But not -- we're not looking right now to encroach on the theatrical window."

And so we've seen some nice growth there, including, by the way, from Hulu. And I think that we're hopeful that the takeup of the digital MVPDs will continue to grow even though I know there's been a lot said about that. I think what I talked about earlier, I think it's, from a demographic perspective, these services tend to be very attractive for younger viewers. They're also less expensive, which I think is important even though I think there might be an opportunity for us to take pricing up a bit at Hulu. And the user experience is great. So we're bullish about the MVPDs. And with that in mind, we believe that ESPN will benefit nicely from that over the long term. The other thing by the way, that is interesting is that there are some entities out there that have gone into the space, notably YouTube, that are obviously quite committed to seeing -- to growing their service. Just look at the World Series and the amount of advertising that was in the World Series for the YouTube service. That suggest to us that we're not the only believer out there, that there are others as well. On the Sky front, I'm not -- look, you can't cry over spilled milk, so to speak, there's nothing we can do about it. We made a bid that we thought was an appropriate bid in terms of what we saw as value to our company. We would have loved to would have had Sky, both because we believe in the asset, and we thought it could have helped us in terms of introducing a direct-to-consumer service in the European market. But again, only at a price that made sense for us. Without Sky, we're still planning on taking Disney Plus out in Europe. We also plan working with Hulu to introduce Hulu in more international markets as well. It could possibly be that it takes us a little bit longer to penetrate some of these markets, but we believe in the product that we will be launching, and we'll make sure that, that product is tailored for the various European markets, not just because it needs to be -- it needs to satisfy what will be quotas for SVODs in Europe, but also because we think it needs to be locally relevant. And we're going to be selective in terms of the markets that we choose initially, but we believe we're going to win -- that we have a real opportunity there, particularly when it comes to the Disney branded service, which is going to feature Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney, of course, and then National Geographic. Those are all very attractive brands in those markets, and that's going to make that product extremely unique and in-demand."

Some time mid to late fiscal 2018, we saw some softness in the tourism market in China, not -- just by the way, not just for us, but across the board. And we basically put in place some discounting, some lower pricing to continue to drive attendance during what we saw as somewhat of a downturn. But we didn't necessarily think it was permanent. We've subsequently taken a lot of those promotions or those price discounting off and the results actually have been good. But I think what we're seeing in China is maybe a slight reduction in consumer confidence and that's having an impact on the business somewhat. But we still believe very, very, very bullishly in, not only the business that we built, but the business that we can continue to invest in. We opened up a new land since we opened Shanghai this past year. We opened Toy Story Land, and we have plans for continued expansion, both attractions and ultimately hotels, but we haven't made any specific announcements about that yet, but we still feel great about that market for our theme park business. And then on the integration front, I think if you look at our company's results over the last, I would say -- let's say, 5 years. You've seen incredibly impressive results at Parks and Resorts and our studio. Businesses that, not only are doing well, but we've continued to grow year after year after year. And if you look at our television business overall, obviously, ESPN has done well, but they've had some of the issues in terms of distribution or subs. The rest of our television business's performance has been relatively modest over that period of time. As we look at this acquisition, not only does it come with great IP, but the television business that we're buying is, we think, very, very attractive, not just in the United States, but across the world if you factor in Star in India and the rest of Asia, and you factor in Europe, where they have substantially greater footprint of channels than we do, which by the way, may ultimately end up helping us with content and distribution when it comes to the direct-to-consumer business. What we also get is a great television studio that's been run by Dana Walden and others, and what we aim to do there is we aim to create in a combined entity, a very, very successful television studio that will be aimed at creating product, not only for the traditional businesses that we're in, namely the channels and the network, but also for our direct-to-consumer services. So there's a very, very important strategic play here in terms of what the studio and the people that will be running the studio can do. And then, of course, we bring -- and we've made these announcements -- we bring Peter Rice in, we bring John Landgraf in. We're bringing in executives that not only have a lot of experience, but a lot of success under their belts on the television side and the ability to not only strengthen the existing Disney television businesses, but to create a television business that is basically designed to service both the, I'll call it, the present as well as the future of the combined entity."

And so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland, clearly, it's the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand, and we think we're going to have some interesting challenges on our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have. And then in Florida, we have 4 parks. Star Wars Land there is going into the Studios park, the Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago, and we've aimed to actually grow the attendance to that park, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is even this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases, they will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses. On the first question about ESPN Plus, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all, we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest in -- from users and subscriptions, which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easily -- easy-to-navigate, easy-to-use and very high quality in terms of the quality of the live streaming. And we've put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events, and we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which was soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers, and we are putting on, by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November. And then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest -- first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform and of the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights thereafter, 20 will be on and exclusive to this product. So I would say, we're kind of just in the early innings, to use the sports analogy, of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're also in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective. And last week, I was in New York at BAMTech, and they gave me a great presentation on personalization and customization, and the technology that they've -- engine that they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard, because we know there's a huge opportunity there given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories. So I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content, and we will add more technology features. And then we haven't really even begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier when we talked about -- actually it was Christine McCarthy, as we talk about putting more college sports on. The affinity that people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary, and we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges who may not be able to find sports from their college on what we call the national sports networks, but we're going to serve them well on this platform."

And then after the deal closes and after we have the 60% ownership, we'll meet with the Hulu management team and the board and discuss what the opportunities are in terms of both global growth and investing more in content. But that's something that we have to do after the deal closes. Your -- the second question, what needs to be done on the BAMTech side? Really, very little in the sense that I mean, there's a lot that needs to be done, but it's being done. I saw an iteration of the app last week and I was very impressed with it. It will -- It's not quite in ready for prime time because it's still being iterated, but there -- it will be elegant, it will be very brand-centric, which will we believe add navigational features that typically don't exist on other platforms, namely that there'll be segments under the brand -- program segments under the brands Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and then National Geographic. So we think there'll be an elegance to it and ease of use, and we're going to super serve the most ardent fans of those 5 different brands by creating experiences and environments that are more tailored or customized and personalized to those brands. We have obviously a very stable product when it comes to live streaming, as I said earlier. That's been tested already on the sports front. We believe that our ability to both attract and ultimately retain consumers is strong from a technology perspective, and now obviously, we have to aid that effort with programming. And I'd say right now, aside from the development that's being done at BAMTech on the app itself, mostly what's going on at the company on the Disney Plus side is ramping up our production and continuing to commit to new product. We mentioned a few today on the call, a Marvel series specifically, and another Star Wars series and a number of movies and docuseries, and there's activity across the board at our company in terms of increased production investment specifically for this app. And it will take some time, obviously, to achieve the kind of scale we're going to need on the steady-state because it takes time to make these products, particularly given the high production values that they will represent. But besides that, we think we're in great shape. We have a game plan in place to bring the product to market. And we hope to show you a fair amount about the app, the app itself and some of the programming and some of our strategies, including our pricing strategy when we have the investor meeting that we talked about having in -- sometime in April on the call earlier."

And since then, we gained approval in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department, and then this week with the EU, those are 2 very significant markets. And for an acquisition of this size and this complexity, we assumed that it would take a certain amount of time for the regulatory authorities to consider all the various marketplace issues that they had to consider. And we are optimistic today because we have been able to gain approval, not only in those 2, but in multiple other markets in countries around the world. We still have a few important countries to go. We're well into those processes and based on what we know, we were able to say earlier on the call that we've gotten more optimistic about our ability to close much earlier than the June time frame that we talked about.

And we're going to have an engine at the company coming from the different entities at the company that will be able to supply Hulu with a lot of high-quality content and more than they currently have. That is the goal. And again, one of the reasons why we announced the structure that we announced is because we believe that's the best structure for us to execute, not just the strategic plans that we have, but to continue to drive growth and results at the traditional businesses. And then on the first question about what I'll call third-party rights or existing agreements, there has been some reporting about this that we're in the market seeking to amend the terms of some of those agreements. I think it would be best if I simply confirm that we are in some discussions about this, but I'm going to leave it at that. I don't have many details I can give you."

I actually had a couple of questions I'd really love to ask, more about the linear TV businesses and how they really [ total ] this. So the first one is on the Disney Channels Kids side, I guess here in the States. There was a note in the press release saying that it was actually a positive source of profit growth year-over-year from the factors including decreased marketing spending, decreased programming spending, increased sales content, which I think might have been to Hulu, among others. Is that something we should expect to see as a trend if you think about the role of those linear kids networks with the pending launch of Disney Plus? And just more broadly, how do you think about the role in the future of those linear kids networks? And finally, to make the second part. The second part of the question, I'll make it quicker, was just -- we hear about the broadcast network, ABC. I think it's fair to say it has the least amount of sports content of -- among the big 4 broadcast networks. Obviously that's related to the fact that you own ESPN. Do you think it's important to have ABC maybe participate more strongly in sports generally as you think about the future of the broadcast network business?"

We also felt that we needed to service ESPN with the kind of programming necessary to drive subscriptions, both in terms of the price as well as the number of subscribers. And it was the right thing to do. ESPN will also be called upon to use some of its licensing capabilities to service ESPN Plus. So while I think that there was some sacrifice associated with it, we think it was the right thing to do for the company. Going forward, we haven't made any decisions as to whether we would put more sports onto ABC or back on to ABC. I imagine we'll be opportunistic about it. If the opportunities exist, we will consider it. But right now, ESPN and ESPN Plus are the priorities. In terms of the Disney Channel comment and the linear networks, we're in linear television in a number of different fronts, and we're going to be in more of it once this deal closes, both here in the United States and around the world when you consider FX and National Geographic, and you add Freeform and ABC and Disney Channel, of course, ESPN. We don't intend to get out of those businesses nor do we intend to what I'll call deprioritize them or sacrifice them as we move into this other space. But we're also realists, and we see what's going on in the marketplace, and we see the growth of new platforms of program consumption versus channel consumption, of disaggregation and of the potential for disintermediation, which basically means the ability for us to take both our channels and our programming direct-to-consumer. We intend to do what is best for the company over the long run, and if that means continuing to support the linear channels because we believe in their value to the company, from a bottom line perspective, we'll do that. And if we see the opportunity grows more and more to, not only invest in, but to move programming over to the direct-to-consumer platforms, we'll do that. We can't, right now, in any way, estimate if that will happen or when it will happen. But we're going to be nimble as I think we've already evidenced by just the fact that we're going into the direct-to-consumer space as aggressively as we're going into it. We're looking at the marketplace. We're seeing disruption, and we're reacting to it, hopefully on a timely basis, so we can take advantage of the trends that we're all seeing today in television."

Adjusted for comparability, earnings per share were up 38% for the quarter and 24% for the year. Christine will give you details about our performance in a few minutes. My remarks are focused on 2 of our biggest priorities in fiscal 2019: the successful completion and integration of our 21st Century Fox acquisition and the further development of our DTC business, which includes adding new content and subscribers to ESPN Plus, gaining a majority stake in Hulu and launching our highly anticipated Disney-branded service late next year. 
With regard to our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we just received EU regulatory approval this week, another major milestone in the process, and we're optimistic about securing the necessary approvals from the territories that remain. Last June, we estimated it could take up to 12 months for the transaction to close, but we are increasingly optimistic it will be meaningfully earlier than that. As I have said numerous times, the value of the portfolio of recognized brands and world-class content we're acquiring is impressive as is the wealth of executive talent at 21st Century Fox, many of whom will hold key positions in the combined company. 
Upon completion of the acquisition, Peter Rice will be Chairman of Walt Disney Television, reporting to me, and will also serve as cochair of our Media Networks group, along with ESPN President, Jimmy Pitaro. Dana Walden, John Landgraf and Gary Knell will also be joining us in leadership roles reporting to Peter. Additionally, a number of 21st Century Fox studio executives will be joining Alan Horn's team at Disney Studio Entertainment, including Emma Watts at 20th Century Fox, Nancy Utley and Steve Gilula at Fox Searchlight, and Elizabeth Gabler at Fox 2000. 
As I mentioned earlier, DTC continues to be one of our top priorities. Our strategic purchase of BAMTech allowed us to enter this arena quickly and effectively, as evidenced by our successful launch of ESPN Plus 6 months ago. More than 1 million users have already subscribed, and we continue to see impressive growth. Sports fans are attracted to an ever-growing number of live events, including Top Rank Boxing, Major League Baseball, the NHL, MLS and Italy's Serie A soccer, along with thousands of college sports events, including 200 college football games this season along with more than 2,900 college basketball match ups, including almost 550 in November alone. We'll add UFC to the ESPN Plus line up, starting in January. 
The platform also features exclusive original content, including the groundbreaking series, Detail, offering Kobe Bryant's insight into the NBA. And as you may have seen, Peyton Manning is now writing and hosting an NFL version. The early growth trajectory of ESPN Plus is very encouraging, and we believe it bodes very well for our overall global DTC strategy. 
Our Disney-branded service, which we're officially calling Disney Plus, will be in the U.S. market late next year, offering a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content, along with unprecedented access to our incredible library of film and television content, including all of our new theatrical releases starting with the 2019 slate. We've already announced a robust pipeline of Disney Plus original content currently in production, including the Mandalorian, the world's first live action Star Wars series written and produced by Jon Favreau. 
As you know, John launched the Marvel cinematic universe with Iron Man. He also redefined live action story-telling in Jungle Book and he's doing it again with Lion King. So we're thrilled to have him creating content for this new platform. In addition to putting together a great story and strong cast, John's got an unbelievable collection of talent behind the camera, including Taika Waititi, the Director of Thor: Ragnarok. 
Over a decade ago, Disney Channel's High School Musical was a real success, and we're building on that success and reimagining the franchise for a new generation with a live-action Disney Plus series. Animation will also be an integral part of Disney Plus. This service will be the exclusive home of the next season of the popular Star Wars animated series, Clone Wars, as well as a new series based on Pixar's beloved Monsters, Inc. franchise. The Disney Plus platform is also a perfect home for a documentary series that will allow us to pull the curtain back and give people a behind-the-scenes perspective. 
We've got several docuseries currently in production, including an exclusive unprecedented look at Walt Disney Imagineering, featuring stories we've never really told before and images we've never shared. Our studios are also creating a robust slate of original films exclusively for Disney Plus, including Noelle starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, a live-action version of Lady and the Tramp, and Togo, an adventure starring 3-time Oscar nominee, Willem Dafoe. We're also currently developing a live-action Marvel series about Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston, playing the character he's made so famous. And we're working on a second live action Star Wars series, a prequel to Rogue One, starring Diego Luna. 
As with ESPN Plus, the launch of Disney Plus will just be the starting point. We plan to continually elevate the experience and enhance the value to consumers with a constant pipeline of exclusive new content as we move forward. 
I visited BAMTech last week and saw an early prototype of the app, which will feature elegant navigation, personalization and content, segmented primarily by our core brands, namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will blend library products with original content under these 5 brand banners, and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition. We're planning an investor conference in April to provide more insight into our DTC strategy, including a first look at Disney Plus, along with some of the content we're creating for it. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our Q4 performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year.

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, driven by Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, which also were significant contributors to the 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018. 
It was a very active year for the company on a number of fronts, and these financial results demonstrate a continued focus on execution of our strategy while we invest to position the company for long-term growth. Our Studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal fiscal year. Higher Studio results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to growth in operating income from our worldwide theatrical business, and to a lesser extent, lower film impairments and growth in TV SVOD distribution and home entertainment. 
Higher worldwide theatrical results reflect the strong performance of Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp, compared to Cars 3 and no Marvel title in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, the Studio generated a record $3 billion in operating income, surpassing the Studio's previous record of $2.7 billion set in fiscal 2016. Our studio results demonstrate once again that a relentless focus on quality, creative excellence and compelling storytelling can lead to consistently strong financial results. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which reflected a $100 million adverse impact of Hurricane Irma during the fourth quarter last year. Higher operating income at our domestic operation was primarily due to guest spending and attendance growth, partially offset by higher costs, including roughly $55 million related to a special cast member bonus we announced earlier in the year. 
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8% and occupancy was up 1 percentage point to 85%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year while booked rates are up 4%. 
Results at our international operations were comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Total segment operating income margin was up 40 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable and a lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter as a result of growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by approximately a 1 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a 1 point impact from foreign exchange. 
The improving sub-trends continued in the fourth quarter, so we've now had 5 consecutive quarters of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting operating income was up meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to higher program sales and growth in affiliate revenue. The increase in program sales was primarily due to the sale of 2 Marvel series versus 1 last year and a sale of Black-ish in the quarter. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. 
Advertising revenue at Broadcasting was comparable to the fourth quarter last year as higher network rates and higher political advertising at our TV stations were offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 35% above upfront levels. Cable results were lower in the quarter as higher operating income at Disney Channel worldwide and Freeform were more than offset by losses at BAMTech, which are consolidated in our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in September of last year. 
BAMTech's fourth quarter results this year reflect content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform. At ESPN, operating income in the quarter was comparable to Q4 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset primarily by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NFL and college sports programming. 
Ad revenue at ESPN was down 6% in the quarter due to a decrease in average viewership and lower units delivered. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year and reflect, in part, a shift in the timing of the college football semi finals. ESPN will once again air 3 of the new year's 6 bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year, 2 of those bowl games will be semifinal games, which aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. 
Equity income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A&E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming, marketing and labor cost, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to asset impairments, which were driven by the write-down of retail store leasehold improvements and lower licensing income, partially offset by lower costs, primarily in our games business. 
Given the pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we did not purchase our stock during the fourth quarter. We repurchased a total of 34.6 million shares for $3.6 billion for fiscal 2018. 
Now I would like to discuss some matters pertaining to fiscal 2019. First, as we previously announced, at the end of Q1, we will begin reporting our financial results under a new structure made up of 4 business segments: Media Networks, Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment, and Direct-to-Consumer and International. In early January, we expect to file 3 years of restated financials that will reflect this new segment reporting structure. 
Second, as Bob mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in April, during which we will discuss our direct-to-consumer businesses in more detail as well as provide additional perspective on our company post the 21st Century Fox acquisition, assuming the transaction will have closed by then. And of course, we will webcast that event. 
While our full year fiscal 2019 results will be influenced by the timing of the closing of the Fox acquisition, I want to highlight some items we already know will affect year-over-year comparability. We are extremely enthusiastic about our 2019 slate, which includes Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, the next Avengers film, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the Lion King. I'll remind you that 2018 was the best year in our studio's history. 
We face a particularly challenging comp in the first quarter due to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Given the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600 million versus 2018. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi also resulted in higher licensing results for the first quarter last year. So the absence of a comparable franchise title this year will weigh on our licensing business in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect cable programming expenses to be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by contractual rate increases for sports rights at ESPN. However, we expect Q1 cable programming expenses to be up 9%, driven by the timing shift of the college football semi finals I mentioned earlier. 
We will continue to invest in both ESPN Plus and our yet-to-be launched Disney Plus service. The continued ramp up of ESPN Plus, which includes investments in sports rights will have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. We'll have more to say about our overall direct-to-consumer strategy and the aggregate full year financial implications during the Investor Day in April. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions."

I know you've got this Investor Day coming, but whatever you're comfortable sharing with us today would be helpful because that's a business that does have some reasonable scale, but does lose money and has multiple products, and I wonder if you could fit into your overall worldview. And then on the Disney Plus service, have you guys thought about the theatrical window around PayOne? I mean, one of the things that might -- that seems like an interesting opportunity would be shortening that window and actually bringing films from theatrical release into the Disney Plus experience earlier than the usual 7 or 8 month window. So I'm wondering if you were -- if you've thought about that opportunity or at least the overall theatrical strategy for Disney Plus. Anything you can share there would be great."

But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do",560,"Well, first of all, regarding Hulu, as you noted, we'll own 60%, which will give us considerable say in how Hulu is run. But there will be 2 other partners unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do with Hulu will be done with an eye toward being fiscally responsible to the other shareholders even though they're minority shareholders. That said, we think that given the success of Hulu so far in terms of subscriber growth and relative brand strength, and other things too like demographics, we think there's an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side. And with this acquisition comes not only some great IP, but some excellent talent, particularly on the television side, although there's talent in both movies and TV. And we aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original programming that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace. I also think Hulu is attractive in many ways. And one I mentioned, demographics. If you look at the demographics of the people consuming off-network shows in Hulu, and you look at the demographics of the same shows on the network, you'll see what could be at times a 20 years' younger audience at Hulu. And that's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu, in that it is a very strong play for advertisers because it can offer targeted ads, and it has great demos, and it's just a great user experience. The quality of the product, meaning the quality of this -- of the television programming is quite high. So overall, I think we've got an opportunity to invest more in Hulu, to grow its subs. I also think there's some pricing elasticity too, but notably on the multichannel front and we'll talk about sometime in the near future. I think there's an opportunity to improve or I should say, increase our pricing there. And it will focus mostly, by the way, on what I'll call general entertainment programming, and we'll leave the more family-oriented programming to the Disney Plus app. On the theatrical -- the question you asked me about the theatrical window, sort of with us if it ain't broke. I know you may think that there's an opportunity, but as noted by the results of our studio in fiscal 2018 and, of course, in the last quarter, we have a studio that is doing extremely well and a formula that is serving us really well in terms of its bottom line. And we're probably going to aim to protect that initial window. And then the other thing that's quite clear to us is that the home video window, as it's been called, that follows the theatrical window, also continues to be quite important to us, both the sale of these films in digitally as well as physical goods. And I think you'll likely see us protect that as well, although there's going to be a discussion around whether there's an opportunity to move the product from that window to what I'll call the Pay One window maybe a little bit sooner. But not -- we're not looking right now to encroach on the theatrical window."

Is any of this improvement coming at this point from the new deals you've done? Or is that to come as you sign more deals into '19?"

And so we've seen some nice growth there, including, by the way, from Hulu. And I think that we're hopeful that the takeup of the digital MVPDs will continue to grow even though I know there's been a lot said about that. I think what I talked about earlier, I think it's, from a demographic perspective, these services tend to be very attractive for younger viewers. They're also less expensive, which I think is important even though I think there might be an opportunity for us to take pricing up a bit at Hulu. And the user experience is great. So we're bullish about the MVPDs. And with that in mind, we believe that ESPN will benefit nicely from that over the long term. The other thing by the way, that is interesting is that there are some entities out there that have gone into the space, notably YouTube, that are obviously quite committed to seeing -- to growing their service. Just look at the World Series and the amount of advertising that was in the World Series for the YouTube service. That suggest to us that we're not the only believer out there, that there are others as well. On the Sky front, I'm not -- look, you can't cry over spilled milk, so to speak, there's nothing we can do about it. We made a bid that we thought was an appropriate bid in terms of what we saw as value to our company. We would have loved to would have had Sky, both because we believe in the asset, and we thought it could have helped us in terms of introducing a direct-to-consumer service in the European market. But again, only at a price that made sense for us. Without Sky, we're still planning on taking Disney Plus out in Europe. We also plan working with Hulu to introduce Hulu in more international markets as well. It could possibly be that it takes us a little bit longer to penetrate some of these markets, but we believe in the product that we will be launching, and we'll make sure that, that product is tailored for the various European markets, not just because it needs to be -- it needs to satisfy what will be quotas for SVODs in Europe, but also because we think it needs to be locally relevant. And we're going to be selective in terms of the markets that we choose initially, but we believe we're going to win -- that we have a real opportunity there, particularly when it comes to the Disney branded service, which is going to feature Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney, of course, and then National Geographic. Those are all very attractive brands in those markets, and that's going to make that product extremely unique and in-demand."

Sometime mid to late fiscal 2018, we saw some softness in the tourism market in China, not -- just by the way, not just for us, but across the board. And we basically put in place some discounting, some lower pricing to continue to drive attendance during what we saw as somewhat of a downturn. But we didn't necessarily think it was permanent. We've subsequently taken a lot of those promotions or those price discounting off and the results actually have been good. But I think what we're seeing in China is maybe a slight reduction in consumer confidence and that's having an impact on the business somewhat. But we still believe very, very, very bullishly in, not only the business that we built, but the business that we can continue to invest in. We opened up a new land since we opened Shanghai this past year. We opened Toy Story Land, and we have plans for continued expansion, both attractions and ultimately hotels, but we haven't made any specific announcements about that yet, but we still feel great about that market for our theme park business. And then on the integration front, I think if you look at our company's results over the last, I would say -- let's say, 5 years. You've seen incredibly impressive results at Parks and Resorts and our studio. Businesses that, not only are doing well, but we've continued to grow year after year after year. And if you look at our television business overall, obviously, ESPN has done well, but they've had some of the issues in terms of distribution or subs. The rest of our television business's performance has been relatively modest over that period of time. As we look at this acquisition, not only does it come with great IP, but the television business that we're buying is, we think, very, very attractive, not just in the United States, but across the world if you factor in Star in India and the rest of Asia, and you factor in Europe, where they have substantially greater footprint of channels than we do, which by the way, may ultimately end up helping us with content and distribution when it comes to the direct-to-consumer business. What we also get is a great television studio that's been run by Dana Walden and others, and what we aim to do there is we aim to create in a combined entity, a very, very successful television studio that will be aimed at creating product, not only for the traditional businesses that we're in, namely the channels and the network, but also for our direct-to-consumer services. So there's a very, very important strategic play here in terms of what the studio and the people that will be running the studio can do. And then, of course, we bring -- and we've made these announcements -- we bring Peter Rice in, we bring John Landgraf in. We're bringing in executives that not only have a lot of experience, but a lot of success under their belts on the television side and the ability to not only strengthen the existing Disney television businesses, but to create a television business that is basically designed to service both the, I'll call it, the present as well as the future of the combined entity."

And so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland, clearly, it's the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand, and we think we're going to have some interesting challenges on our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have. And then in Florida, we have 4 parks. Star Wars Land there is going into the Studios park, the Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago, and we've aimed to actually grow the attendance to that park, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is even this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases, they will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses. On the first question about ESPN Plus, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all, we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest in -- from users and subscriptions, which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easily -- easy-to-navigate, easy-to-use and very high quality in terms of the quality of the live streaming. And we've put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events, and we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which was soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers, and we are putting on, by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November. And then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest -- first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform and of the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights thereafter, 20 will be on and exclusive to this product. So I would say, we're kind of just in the early innings, to use the sports analogy, of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're also in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective. And last week, I was in New York at BAMTech, and they gave me a great presentation on personalization and customization, and the technology that they've -- engine that they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard, because we know there's a huge opportunity there given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories. So I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content, and we will add more technology features. And then we haven't really even begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier when we talked about -- actually it was Christine McCarthy, as we talk about putting more college sports on. The affinity that people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary, and we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges who may not be able to find sports from their college on what we call the national sports networks, but we're going to serve them well on this platform."

And then after the deal closes and after we have the 60% ownership, we'll meet with the Hulu management team and the board and discuss what the opportunities are in terms of both global growth and investing more in content. But that's something that we have to do after the deal closes. Your -- the second question, what needs to be done on the BAMTech side? Really, very little in the sense that I mean, there's a lot that needs to be done, but it's being done. I saw an iteration of the app last week and I was very impressed with it. It will -- It's not quite in ready for prime time because it's still being iterated, but there -- it will be elegant, it will be very brand-centric, which will, we believe, add navigational features that typically don't exist on other platforms, namely that there'll be segments under the brand -- program segments under the brands Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and then National Geographic. So we think there'll be an elegance to it and ease of use, and we're going to super serve the most ardent fans of those 5 different brands by creating experiences and environments that are more tailored or customized and personalized to those brands. We have obviously a very stable product when it comes to live streaming, as I said earlier. That's been tested already on the sports front. We believe that our ability to both attract and ultimately retain consumers is strong from a technology perspective, and now obviously, we have to aid that effort with programming. And I'd say right now, aside from the development that's being done at BAMTech on the app itself, mostly what's going on at the company on the Disney Plus side is ramping up our production and continuing to commit to new product. We mentioned a few today on the call, a Marvel series specifically, and another Star Wars series and a number of movies and docuseries, and there's activity across the board at our company in terms of increased production investment specifically for this app. And it will take some time, obviously, to achieve the kind of scale we're going to need on the steady-state because it takes time to make these products, particularly given the high production values that they will represent. But besides that, we think we're in great shape. We have a game plan in place to bring the product to market. And we hope to show you a fair amount about the app, the app itself and some of the programming and some of our strategies, including our pricing strategy when we have the investor meeting that we talked about having in -- sometime in April on the call earlier."

We think it would quickly get very complicated if we aggregated content that was really owned fully by other entities. And we think we'll have -- we have enough there right now, and we'll be able to continue to license more. On the time line, when we first announced this deal in December of '17 and then when we closed the deal again where we made the deal later in the year, we talked about a time line first that would be 12 to 18 months and roughly, I think we talked about 12 months from what was June. And since then, we gained approval in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department, and then this week with the EU, those are 2 very significant markets. And for an acquisition of this size and this complexity, we assumed that it would take a certain amount of time for the regulatory authorities to consider all the various marketplace issues that they had to consider. And we are optimistic today because we have been able to gain approval, not only in those 2, but in multiple other markets in countries around the world. We still have a few important countries to go. We're well into those processes and based on what we know, we were able to say earlier on the call that we've gotten more optimistic about our ability to close much earlier than the June time frame that we talked about. And then I think it's just best to leave it at that because frankly, we don't know specifically when it will be."

I actually had a couple of questions I'd really love to ask, more about the linear TV businesses and how they really [ total ] this. So the first one is on the Disney Channels Kids side, I guess here in the States. There was a note in the press release saying that it was actually a positive source of profit growth year-over-year from the factors including decreased marketing spending, decreased programming spending, increased sales content, which I think might have been to Hulu, among others. Is that something we should expect to see as a trend if you think about the role of those linear kids networks with the pending launch of Disney Plus? And just more broadly, how do you think about the role in the future of those linear kids networks? And finally, to make the second part. The second part of the question, I'll make it quicker, was just -- we hear about the broadcast network, ABC. I think it's fair to say it has the least amount of sports content of -- among the big 4 broadcast networks. Obviously that's related to the fact that you own ESPN. Do you think it's important to have ABC maybe participate more strongly in sports generally as you think about the future of the broadcast network business?"

We also felt that we needed to service ESPN with the kind of programming necessary to drive subscriptions, both in terms of the price as well as the number of subscribers. And it was the right thing to do. ESPN will also be called upon to use some of its licensing capabilities to service ESPN Plus. So while I think that there was some sacrifice associated with it, we think it was the right thing to do for the company. Going forward, we haven't made any decisions as to whether we would put more sports onto ABC or back on to ABC. I imagine we'll be opportunistic about it. If the opportunities exist, we will consider it. But right now, ESPN and ESPN Plus are the priorities. In terms of the Disney Channel comment and the linear networks, we're in linear television in a number of different fronts, and we're going to be in more of it once this deal closes, both here in the United States and around the world when you consider FX and National Geographic, and you add Freeform and ABC and Disney Channel, of course, ESPN. We don't intend to get out of those businesses nor do we intend to what I'll call deprioritize them or sacrifice them as we move into this other space. But we're also realists, and we see what's going on in the marketplace, and we see the growth of new platforms of program consumption versus channel consumption, of disaggregation and of the potential for disintermediation, which basically means the ability for us to take both our channels and our programming direct-to-consumer. We intend to do what is best for the company over the long run, and if that means continuing to support the linear channels because we believe in their value to the company, from a bottom line perspective, we'll do that. And if we see the opportunity grows more and more to, not only invest in, but to move programming over to the direct-to-consumer platforms, we'll do that. We can't, right now, in any way, estimate if that will happen or when it will happen. But we're going to be nimble as I think we've already evidenced by just the fact that we're going into the direct-to-consumer space as aggressively as we're going into it. We're looking at the marketplace. We're seeing disruption, and we're reacting to it, hopefully on a timely basis, so we can take advantage of the trends that we're all seeing today in television."
