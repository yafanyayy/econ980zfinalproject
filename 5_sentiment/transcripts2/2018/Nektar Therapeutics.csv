On today's call, we will for the Nektar's pipeline for the next month, including our planned submission for a Nektar 181 in the second quarter and t",2185,"Thank you, Jennifer. And thank you to everyone for joining us today for our year-end 2017 conference call. On today's call, we will for the Nektar's pipeline for the next month, including our planned submission for a Nektar 181 in the second quarter and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with Nektar 214, Nektar 262 and NKTR-255. We will also provide our financial guidance for 2018. 
2017 was a truly transformational year for our company. We achieved major successes on multiple fronts with Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas; pain, immuno-oncology and immunology. This is a single set of achievements that is truly remarkable and is a culmination of many years of hard work and scientific innovation by the Nektar team. 
In the area of chronic pain, all Phase III trials of NKTR-181 were successful; the efficacy study in patients, the long-term safety study in patients and the pivotal human abuse liability study conducted in a recreational drug users. This successful and comprehensive Phase III development program will enable us to submit an NDA package for NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. 
In immuno-oncology, we developed a highly valuable and highly-focused strategy, which resulted in a pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. We now have a strong pipeline in immuno-oncology NKTR-214, NKTR-262 and NKTR-255. We've had compelling results with our lead I-O program, NKTR-214, in terms of clinical efficacy, safety and supporting translational science, which led to our recent strategic collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. The collaboration enables us to develop NKTR-214 broadly and rapidly, in order to establish it as a backbone for cancer care across multiple indications. 
And in immunology, we opened the IND and began clinical development with NKTR-358, a first-in-class T reg targeting resolution therapeutic to treat autoimmune disease. 
Our preclinical success with NKTR-358 led to an extensive partnership with Eli Lilly to develop NKTR-358 for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Based upon the proof of mechanism results observed to date in a single ascending dose first-in-human trial, NKTR-358 is now advancing into lupus patients in a multiple ascending dose study, which we plan to begin in the second quarter of this year. 
I don't know if any other company at our stage of development to have this number of substantial and successful achievements in a single year and I'm very proud of our employees. 
First, let's review the substantial progress we've made with NKTR-181. In the past 2 months, we've had 2 highly productive pre-NDA meetings with the agency to discuss our clinical, nonclinical and CMC data packages that will go into our NDA submission. As you know, our NDA data package includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. This includes our 600-patient Phase III efficacy trial, our 2 human abuse potential studies and our 630 patient Phase III long-term safety study, which also included long-term measurements of pain control as well as a wide in case of PK/PD therapeutic and super therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in over 450 healthy subjects. 
The FDA staff gave us clear and collaborative guidance on the expectations for completion of our NDA submission. An agreement was reached to file the package in the second quarter of this year. The agency further confirmed that Nektar has an adequate abuse potential assessment data package and that together with the safety population, the data appear to be adequate to warrant a discussion of a less restrictive scheduling than scheduled 2. As I said earlier, we are on track to submit the end the year before filing in the second quarter of this year. 
NKTR-181 has emerged not only as a clinical important new potential to patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but also as an important component of a solution to address the opioid public health emergency. 
This afternoon, Steve and I were invited to and participated in the Opioid Submit at the White House, which focused on the treatment of addiction in our country and the education, prevention and treatment of pain patients in light of the current opioid epidemic we are facing. A key theme of this event was the importance of providing pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs. As the first new full new opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medications for abuse. 
We strongly believe that we could add more value to NKTR-181 through the continuing regulatory process. We believe NKTR-181 is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction and we are highly focused on the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval. We are actively evaluating potential licensing to commercial partners or other strategic structural alternatives while we advanced the regulatory process. 
Finally, we are very pleased to announce today that 2 NKTR-181 abstracts of our objective for oral presentation at the upcoming 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting for the college of problems of drug dependence, which will be held in San Diego the week of June 9. The first presentation will feature results from our dopamine microdialysis animal models, which show that NKTR-181 does not create the same dopamine surge in the brain's reward center as is observed with standard opioids. The second presentation will review a new positive data from our Phase III efficacy study from an important exploratory end point related to assessing the abuse potential of the medicine. The end point used a new measurement tool called Matters, which was developed with the FDA action public-private partnership initiative in order to quantify potential abuse related events in clinical trials. The Matter tool specifically developed to generate evidence to support approval, labeling and scheduling decisions for new medicines. 
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we've recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the global leader in immuno-oncology. This new collaboration is a major strategic strategic step forward for our company in order to establish Nektar as a new leader in the immuno-oncology field. The collaboration's broad clinical development program ensures that we could advance this new potential medicine to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. As you know, Nektar will book all global revenue and we will keep 65% of global profits for NKTR-214. We will also receive an upfront payment of $1 billion and a premium equity investment of $850 million at $102.60 per share. We expect the collaboration to commence in the second quarter once the HSR review period ends. 
Since we have the flexibility to pursue other combination possibilities, we maintain pricing and distribution control for NKTR-214 and our partner has committed to paying 2/3 of the collaborations development costs. We now have the right foundation in place to maximize the value of NKTR-214. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar will be initiating over 20 registrational-enabling studies that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types. These trials will start within the first 14 months of the collaboration. And the first 2 Phase III studies, which Bristol will start in the middle of this year will be conducted in patients with first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma. We plan to share the design of these trials later this year at ASCO. 
At ASCO, we will also share our first presentation of data from the second part of the ongoing PIVOT study of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO known as the expansion stage. 
At JP Morgan, I provided an update on the patients from the first part of the ongoing PIVOT study, the 38 patients from the dose escalation stage. To remind you, the response rate that we reported at JP Morgan were 75% response in second line I-O naïve non-small-cell lung cancer, a 64% response rate in first-line I-O naïve melanoma patients and a 57% response rate in first-line I-O naïve renal cell carcinoma patients. Further, all of the partial and complete responses observed in the dose escalation stage of the trial has been confirmed and we see ongoing tumor shrinkage. And all patients with responses from the dose escalation continue on treatment. Importantly, there have been no patients with responses who relapsed in any of the tumor types. This highlights that the length of time patients spend on treatment with the combination of NKTR-214 plus nivolumab is correlated with further tumor shrinkage and improved and continued response. 
Specifically, I want to take a moment to focus on the improvement in response over time for the 14 patients with first-line renal cell carcinoma. When we initially present the first-line RCC dose escalation data at the Conference in November of last year, the response rate was 46%. As I just said 2 months later at the time of JP Morgan, the response rate was 57%. Today, we're pleased to report that we have additional patients with stable disease that converted to responders, which means we now have a 71% response rate in first-line RCC with all patients with responses confirmed in ongoing treatment. 
There is also 1 additional patient in first-line RCC with stable disease who is still on treatment as well. That patient has experienced tumor reduction and also has the potential to convert to respond. Across the entire 38 patients in the dose escalation in all tumor types, we now see a confirmed 60% overall response rate in the 20 patients with baseline PD-L1 negative status. In addition, our safety profile across the entire PIVOT population continues to be encouraging with no patients discontinuing because of treatment-related AEs and a low 11% in G3 adverse event rate and over 150 patients treated to date. 
As I just stated at ASCO, we will present the first data from the second expansion state of the study. The PIVOT study continues to enroll patients into the second expansion stage. As you will recall, we plan to enroll 330 patients into 13 different expansion cohorts that spanned 5 different tumor types. We expect to complete enrollment for the first 5 tumor types by the end of the third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, we will add 3 new expansion cohorts to PIVOT; gastric, colorectal and small cell lung cancer. We will begin enrollment very shortly after the HSR review period. 
As we retain the ability to develop NKTR-214 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, we plan to initiate additional development collaborations this year. This will ensure that we maximize our potentials to rapidly establish NKTR-214 as the future backbone of immuno-oncology therapy. 
Today, we have several Nektar-214 combination programs underway in nonclinical tumor models, including a collaboration with Takeda with 5 different targets as well as vaccine and other small molecule programs. Based on the positive results from multiple preclinical studies, we expect to advance several new combinations into the clinic this year. 
At the upcoming AACR conference in April, we will present 4 separate nonclinical data sets for NKTR-214, including a combination of NKTR-214 with an inhibitor in models of renal and cancer and a combination of NKTR-214 with an adoptive T cell transplant approach, conducted in collaboration with Dr.  It is important to note that the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration puts us in a very strong position and allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TOR 78 agonist and NKTR-255, and I-O candidate that can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. The preclinical data for the Nektar 214, 262 combination are particularly compelling and we're on track to dose the participation in the novel combination trial of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214 this month. The trial will enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings. 
The first stage of the trial will assess the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. In the second stage of the trial, we have the option to evaluate a triplet a NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. We expect to have their initial data from that's trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As I stated earlier, with success and the Phase Ia single ascending dose trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 is now stated to enter multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus in the second quarter of this year. This phase Ib study will enroll approximately 50 patients and will evaluate safety and biomarkers of NKTR-358. With a 12-week treatment period, we expect the trial duration to be 18 to 24 months with initial beta sometime in 2019. 
And with that, I will hand the call over to Gil to provide financial guidance for 2018."

I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance. Our royalty revenue from Movantik and continue to go nicely and we expect this growth of royalty",858,"Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance. 
Our royalty revenue from Movantik and continue to go nicely and we expect this growth of royalty revenue to continue in 2018. Our royalty revenue for 2017 was approximately $33.5 million, which represents a 72% increase from 2016. 
On January 15, 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ADYNOVATE as it is known in Europe, enabling patient access to ADYNOVATE throughout Europe beginning this year. 
As a result of this European approval, we will recognize a $10 million milestone in Q1 of this year. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. First, starting with our cash position. Including the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration, we expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion. For 2018 GAAP revenue, our guidance for revenue outside of the payments from the Bristol collaboration, is between $100 million and $110 million, which we expect to be ratable over the four quarters of 2018, with the exception of the $10 million milestone payment for the European approval of ADYNOVATE that we will recognize this quarter. 
With respect to the BMS collaboration, we expect to receive the upfront payments when the HSR review period ends, which we estimate will occur in the second quarter of this year. While we currently anticipate that a portion of the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration will likely be recognized in 2018, we are working closely with our independent auditors to determine the new GAAP ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting principles will apply to the BMS collaboration payments. 
We expect to complete this analysis and provide our final assessment of revenue recognition for the BMS collaboration on our Q1 quarterly financial results call. In the meantime, we recommend for modeling purposes to include a placeholder of $125 million in revenue to be recognized in Q2 of 2018 for the BMS collaboration. 
We anticipate 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We expect to incur R&D expense on a fairly ratable basis over the four quarters of 2018. There are a few key points that I want to highlight for our 2018 R&D investment plan. 
Our plans for the NKTR-214 development program include substantially completing enrollment in all of the current PIVOT expansion cohorts by the third quarter of this year, a goal BMS and Nektar is already working towards other our current clinical trial collaboration agreement. In connection with our new collaboration agreement, after the conclusion of the HSR review period, we and BMS plans to start at least 20 registrational trials within 14 months after the collaboration is effective. 
Our plan includes the start of Phase III studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma by mid-2018 as well as other indications in the second half of 2018. After the collaboration is effective, we will work closely with BMS to continue planning the operational execution activities for the broad joint clinical development campaign that is outlined in our collaboration. Keep in mind, that under our BMS strategic collaboration agreement, our cash outlay is subject to an annual cap of $125 million in GAAP development expenses, which will be for 2018 from the closing date of the agreement. 
While we will continue to recognize a GAAP R&D expense for NKTR-214 to the extent such expenses exceed the $125 million annual payment GAAP, BMS will reimburse Nektar for all development cost in excess of the annual cap under a quarterly reconciliation process. 
For NKTR-358, our plans includes the startup Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in lupus patients in the second quarter of 2018. As you will recall, after the conclusion of the Phase Ib study, Eli Lilly will then lead the development program for NKTR-358 from Phase II through regulatory approval with Nektar being a co-development partner. 
Later this month, we will commence our Phase I clinical study for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214 with an enrollment showed you that will allow us to establish our Phase II recommended dose and share initial data from the study before the end of this year. 
We also continue to advance the NKTR-255 program towards an IND filing, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2019. For NKTR-181, we plan to make a significant investment this year to advance NKTR-181 through the FDA approval process, including the planned NDA filing in Q2, drug-drug interaction studies needed to finalize labeling, CMC stability studies as well as manufacturing the initial commercial launch 
G&A expense for 2018 is projected to be between $65 million and $68 million, which includes $28 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. 
For 2018 interest expense will be approximately $40 million, including approximately $19 million of noncash interest expense related to the royalty monetization. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration. And that's both in terms of the frequency, even the dose volume, even the relationship of dose to properties of the tumor, such as the tumor size the tumor's age and even some of the underlying composition of the cells inside the tumor. So we took all that into consideration when we went and did all of the IND-enabling nonclinical toxicology studies, which then further allowed us to pick a starting dose, which we could justify based on all of those parameters that I just described as well as the overall toxicology assessment that's required by the FDA before you open a first-in-human trial. So all of that was considered to pick our starting dose. And I'll give a little bit more color on that also in the way we designed the clinical trial injecting either 1 or 2 tumors any occasion of intratumoral administration. So this is very different than saying something like where you could be injecting 10 or more tumors in any given time. So this is very different approach than that. And also, the frequency of that injection is either once or on a 21-day cycle, we have a chance to dose a few times and we stage the patients as needed. So it's a very almost minimalistic amount of intratumoral administrations, which we think is going to be very key to the overall success of Nektar-262. And then in terms of the combination of NKTR-214, the philosophy there is that we know that any immune action of the immune system has to end with a fateful hand off to the adaptive immune response. And that initial innate response, which is not antigen specific then switches to be antigen-specific at the adaptive level. And so the whole kind of science behind this combination is that when you co-administer the 2 agents, in particular, having NKTR-214 on board after the IV administration is really increases the efficiency of that to handoff and it actually really increases the number and reactive T cells and then those can go off and give you an response, really targeting any tumor in the patient, even the tumors that are very far away from the few that were injected."

Look as you know, there are no other drug like in development like NKTR-214. Everybody is now jumping on the isle 2 bandwagon, but the fact of the matter is, there is nothing else in clinical development that looks like NKTR-214. And as you could also imagine, there are many, many companies that are highly interested in combining NKTR-214 with their unique molecules. I don't know that I expect significant upfront money to change hands here. I don't think that we are looking for. I don't think that's a priority for us at this moment. I think the most important thing we can do is find the right partners, whether it be small molecules, whether they be vaccines there is a will range of things. Let's find the right partner with the best potential opportunity and let's figure out how to work with that part is to combine NKTR-214 with their technology and show that NKTR-214 genuinely is the centerpiece of immuno-oncology. On the second question with regard to NKTR-181, look, again, clearly, I don't want to suggest that money is not important. It is very, very important. Cash is very, very important. At this point, we have -- we are probably in better shape than most biotech companies. And I think we can gain a lot by nurturing NKTR-181 through the regulatory process. And the further it goes through the regulatory process, the more likely it is that we can build in value on top of what we've already built. We've had our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA where excellent. The FDA is very supportive and has been extremely collaborative in helping us move NKTR-181 forward. And as I said, we have agreement with them that we will be filing the next NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year and they're taking a very close look at what it would be to give it a scheduling that is better set schedule 2. So we are very happy about that we expect to filing. And at this point, we are talking to companies that we are evaluating other possibilities and other strategic structures that could bring NKTR 181 to patients. I can tell you that NKTR Therapeutics has no with the intention of marketing NKTR-181. That is not our expertise. We are immuno-oncology, immunology company and that's where we're going to focus our efforts. But there are all kind of strategic structures, there is all kinds of potential collaborations with companies that we are discussing. And I'm hopeful that we will get this the patients rather rapidly. As I said, Steve and I were invited to and we attended the Opioid Summit at the White House today. We are actually in Washington right now that's why we are in different locations. And there is no doubt that a drug like NKTR-181 has the potential to be a major component of the solution for the opioid crisis. No doubt about that. So we're looking at all the possibilities, and I think we're going to be very proud of the results in the end."

First, let me touch on the first part of your question, how do you -- what's the market for a drug that dose just a few times. I think look, if you have an important drug like NKTR-262, I think everybody understands that CLR 78 agonist that is potentially very, very important in immuno-oncology but of course, it can be delivered systemically. If you give it systematically, I think the side effect profile would be significantly problematic. On the other hand, when you combine it with 214, you do get the affects and that I think is very, very important program. Now I don't want to talk about what the market potential is because you have to talk about pricing and I don't think we are ready to do that yet, given the early stage of development. But clearly, what this allows us to have is a Nektar wholly-owned combination. So it means that we have NKTR-214 and NKTR-262, of course I said 262 and 214, because 262 theoretically comes first in the cascade. So with that wholly-owned combination, maybe there is no need for a checkpoint inhibitor with that combination. So we have to see how that plays out. We have to see how that evolves. And depending on the efficacy that we see from that and how valuable that combination is, it will create a market for itself. With regard to the safety profile, I'll let Mary go into some detail. But I think, it's very important to note, no one has dropped off of NKTR-214 studies because of safety issues. Not a single patient has stopped therapy because of safety. That's an important distinction. Please follow through, Mary."

And as we shared many times, our hypothesis of increasing Tregs in the periphery, but not intra-tumorally, we don't see a higher rate of you would in checkpoint inhibitors. The most common symptoms that we see are flulike symptoms tend to occur in the first cycle. And as patients are treated with subsequent cycle, patients will become more to the cytokine and do not have flulike symptoms as they progress through treatment. The physicians really appreciate this because it is easy to manage the patient. About 24 to 48 hours after dosing, patients can expect to have fever and they take Tylenol or NSAID and it's also very quickly in a couple of days. And the predictability of the side effect profile is very much appreciated by physicians and alike. Again, we don't have discontinuations.

We will also provide our financial guidance for 2018.
2017 was a truly transformational year for our company. We achieved major successes on multiple fronts with Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: pain, immuno-oncology and immunology. This is a singular set of achievements that is truly remarkable and is the combination of many years of hard work and scientific innovation by the Nektar team.
In the area of chronic pain, all Phase III trials of NKTR-181 were successful; the efficacy study in patients, the long-term safety study in patients and the pivotal human abuse liability study conducted in recreational drug users. This successful and comprehensive Phase III development program will enable us to submit an NDA package for NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. 
In immuno-oncology, we developed a highly valuable and highly-focused strategy, which resulted in a pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. We now have a strong pipeline in immuno-oncology NKTR-214, NKTR-262 and NKTR-255. We've had compelling results with our lead I-O program, NKTR-214, in terms of clinical efficacy, safety and supporting translational science, which led to our recent strategic collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. The collaboration enables us to develop NKTR-214 broadly and rapidly, in order to establish it as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications.
And in immunology, we opened the IND and began clinical development with NKTR-358, a first-in-class T reg targeting resolution therapeutic to treat autoimmune disease.
Our preclinical success with NKTR-358 led to an extensive partnership with Eli Lilly to develop NKTR-358 for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Based upon the proof of mechanism results observed to date in a single-ascending dose first-in-human trial, NKTR-358 is now advancing into lupus patients in a multiple ascending dose study, which we plan to begin in the second quarter of this year. 
I don't know if any other company at our stage of development to have this number of substantial and successful achievements in a single year. And I'm very proud of our employees. 
First, let's review the substantial progress we've made with NKTR-181. In the past 2 months, we've had 2 highly productive pre-NDA meetings with the agency to discuss our clinical, nonclinical and CMC data packages that will go into our NDA submission. As you know, our NDA data package includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. This includes our 600-patient Phase III efficacy trial, our 2 human abuse potential studies and our 630-patient Phase III long-term safety study, which also included long-term measurements of pain control as well as a wide range of PK and PD studies of therapeutic and super therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in over 450 healthy subjects. 
The FDA staff gave us clear and collaborative guidance on the expectations for completion of our NDA submission. An agreement was reached to file the package in the second quarter of this year. The agency further confirmed that Nektar has an adequate abuse potential assessment data package and that together with the safety population, the data appear to be adequate to warrant a discussion of a less restrictive scheduling than Schedule II. As I said earlier, we're on track to submit the NDA for filing in the second quarter of this year.
NKTR-181 has emerged not only as a critically important new potential medicine to treat patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but also as an important component of a solution to address the opioid public health emergency.
This afternoon, Steve and I were invited to and participated in the opioid submit at the White House, which focused on the treatment of addiction in our country and the education, prevention and treatment of pain patients in light of the current opioid epidemic we are facing. A key theme of this event was the importance of providing pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs. As the first new full new opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medications for abuse.
We strongly believe that we could add more value to NKTR-181 through the continuing regulatory process. We believe NKTR-181 is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction, and we are highly focused on the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval. We are actively evaluating potential licensing to commercial partners or other strategic structural alternatives that -- while we advance the regulatory process.
Finally, we are very pleased to announce today that 2 NKTR-181 abstracts were accepted for oral presentation at the upcoming 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting for the college of problems of drug dependence, which will be held in San Diego the week of June 9. The first presentation will feature results from our dopamine microdialysis animal models, which show that NKTR-181 does not create the same dopamine surge in the brain's reward center as is observed with standard opioids.
The second presentation will review new positive data from our Phase III efficacy study from an important exploratory end point related to assessing the abuse potential of the medicine. The end point used in new measurement tool called Matters, which was developed with the FDA action public-private partnership initiative in order to quantify potential abuse related events in clinical trials. The Matters tool was specifically developed to generate evidence to support approval, labeling and scheduling decisions for new medicines.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the global leader in immuno-oncology. This new collaboration is a major strategic step forward for our company in order to establish Nektar as a new leader in the immuno-oncology field. The collaboration's broad clinical development program ensures that we could advance this new potential medicine to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. As you know, Nektar will book all global revenue, and we will keep 65% of global profits for NKTR-214. We will also receive an upfront payment of $1 billion and a premium equity investment of $850 million at $102.60 per share. We expect the collaboration to commence in the second quarter once the HSR review period ends.
Since we have the flexibility to pursue other combination possibilities, we maintain pricing and distribution control for NKTR-214 and our partner has committed to pay 2/3 of the collaborations development costs. We now have the right foundation in place to maximize the value of NKTR-214. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar will be initiating over 20 registrational-enabling studies that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types. These trials will start within the first 14 months of the collaboration. And the first 2 Phase III studies, which Bristol will start in the middle of this year will be conducted in patients with first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma. We plan to share the design of these trials later this year at ASCO.
At ASCO, we will also share our first presentation of data from the second part of the ongoing PIVOT study of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo known as the expansion stage.
At JP Morgan, I provided an update on the patients from the first part of the ongoing PIVOT study, the 38 patients from the dose escalation stage. To remind you, the response rates we reported at JP Morgan were 75% response in second line I-O naïve non-small-cell lung cancer, a 64% response rate in first-line I-O naïve melanoma patients and a 57% response rate in first-line I-O naïve renal cell carcinoma patients. 
Further, all of the partial and complete responses observed in the dose escalation stage of the trial has been confirmed, and we see ongoing tumor shrinkage. And all patients with responses from dose escalation continue on treatment. Importantly, there have been no patients with responses who relapsed in any of the tumor types. This highlights that the length of time patients spend on treatment with the combination of NKTR-214 plus nivolumab is correlated with further tumor shrinkage and improved and continued response.
Specifically, I want to take a moment to focus on the improvement in response over time for the 14 patients with the first -- with first-line renal cell carcinoma. When we initially presented the first-line RCC dose escalation data at the SITC Conference in November of last year, the response rate was 46%. As I've just said 2 months later at the time of JP Morgan, the response rate was 57%. Today, we're pleased to report that we have additional patients with stable disease that converted to responders, which means we now have a 71% response rate in first-line RCC with all patients with responses confirmed in ongoing treatment.
There is also one additional patient in the first-line RCC with stable disease who is still on treatment as well. That patient had experienced tumor reduction and also has a potential to convert to respond. Across the entire 38 patients in dose escalation in all tumor types, we now see a confirmed 60% overall response rate in the 20 patients with baseline PD-L1 negative status. In addition, our safety profile across the entire PIVOT population continues to be encouraging with no patients discontinuing because of treatment-related AEs and a low 11% G3 adverse event rate and over 150 patients treated to date. 
As I've just stated at ASCO, we will present the first data from the second expansion stage of the study. The PIVOT study continues to enroll patients into the second expansion stage. As you will recall, we plan to enroll 330 patients into 13 different expansion cohorts that spanned 5 different tumor types. We expect to complete enrollment for the first 5 tumor types by the end of the third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, we will add 3 new expansion cohorts to PIVOT; gastric, colorectal and small cell lung cancer. We will begin enrollment very shortly after the HSR review period.
As we retain the ability to develop NKTR-214 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, we plan to initiate additional development collaborations this year. This will ensure that we maximize our potentials to rapidly establish NKTR-214 as the future backbone of immuno-oncology therapy.
Today, we have several Nektar-214 combination programs underway in nonclinical tumor models, including a collaboration with Takeda with 5 different targets as well as vaccine and other small molecule programs. Based on the positive results from multiple preclinical studies, we expect to advance several new combinations into the clinic this year.
At the upcoming AACR conference in April, we will present 4 separate nonclinical data sets for NKTR-214, including a combination of NKTR-214 with an HDAC inhibitor in models of renal and colon cancer. And a combination of NKTR-214 with an adoptive T cell transplant approach, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Tony Ribas. It is important to note that Bristol-Myers Squibb -- that the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration puts us in a very strong financial position and allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TOR 78 agonist and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate that can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. The preclinical data for the Nektar 214, 262 combination are particularly compelling. And we're on track to dose the first patient in the novel-novel combination trial of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214 this month. The trial will enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
The first stage of the trial will assess the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. In the second stage of the trial, we have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have the initial data from this trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As I stated earlier, with success in the Phase Ia single ascending dose trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 is now slated to enter Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus in the second quarter of this year. This Phase Ib study will enroll approximately 50 patients and will evaluate safety and biomarkers of NKTR-358. With a 12-week treatment period, we expect the trial duration to be 18 to 24 months with initial data sometime in 2019.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Gil to provide financial guidance for 2018."
29929,553628101,1408454,"Nektar Therapeutics, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Nektar Therapeutics","Executives","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we ex",869,"Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.
Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we expect this growth of our royalty revenue to continue in 2018. Our royalty revenue for 2017 was approximately $33.5 million, which represents a 72% increase from 2016.
On January 15, 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ADYNOVATE as ADYNOVATE is known in Europe, enabling patient access to ADYNOVATE throughout Europe beginning this year.
As a result of this European approval, we will recognize a $10 million milestone in Q1 of this year.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. First, starting with our cash position. Including the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration, we expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion. For 2018 GAAP revenue, our guidance for revenue outside of the payments from the Bristol collaboration, is between $100 million and $110 million, which we expect to be ratable over the four quarters of 2018, with the exception of the $10 million milestone payment for the European approval of ADYNOVATE that we will recognize this quarter.
With respect to the BMS collaboration, we expect to receive the upfront payments when HSR review period ends, which we estimate will occur in the second quarter of this year. While we currently anticipate that a portion of the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration will likely be recognized in 2018, we are working closely with our independent auditors to determine the new GAAP ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting principle will apply to the BMS collaboration payments.
We expect to complete this analysis and provide our final assessment of revenue recognition for the BMS collaboration on our Q1 quarterly financial results call. In the meantime, we recommend for modeling purposes to include a placeholder of $125 million in revenue to be recognized in Q2 of 2018 for the BMS collaboration.
We anticipate 2017 -- 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We expect to incur R&D expense on a fairly ratable basis over the four quarters of 2018. There are a few key points that I want to highlight for our 2018 R&D investment plan.
Our plans for the NKTR-214 development program include substantially completing enrollment in all of the current PIVOT expansion cohorts by the third quarter of this year, a goal BMS and Nektar were already working towards under our current clinical trial collaboration agreement. In connection with our new collaboration agreement, after the conclusion of the HSR review period, we and BMS plans to start at least 20 registrational trials within 14 months after the collaboration is effective.
Our plan includes the start of Phase III studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma by mid-2018 as well as other indications in the second half of 2018. After the collaboration is effective, we will work closely with BMS to continue planning the operational execution activities for the broad joint clinical development campaign that is outlined in our collaboration. Keep in mind, that under our BMS strategic collaboration agreement, our cash outlay is subject to an annual cap of $125 million in GAAP development expenses, which will be pro rated for 2018 from the closing date of the agreement.
While we will continue to recognize GAAP R&D expense for NKTR-214 to the extent such expenses exceed the $125 million annual payment GAAP, BMS will reimburse Nektar for all development cost in excess of the annual cap under our quarterly reconciliation process.
For NKTR-358, our plans include the start of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in lupus patients in the second quarter of 2018. As you will recall, after the conclusion of the Phase Ib study, Eli Lilly will then lead the development program for NKTR-358 from Phase II through regulatory approval with Nektar being a codevelopment partner.
Later this month, we will commence our Phase I clinical study for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214, with an enrollment schedule that should allow us to establish our Phase II recommended dose and share initial data from the study before the end of this year.
We also continue to advance the NKTR-255 program towards an IND filing, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2019. For NKTR-181, we plan to make a significant investment this year to advance NKTR-181 through the FDA approval process, including the planned NDA filing in Q2, drug-drug interaction studies needed to finalize labeling, CMC stability studies as well as manufacturing the initial commercial launch supplies. 
G&A expense for 2018 is projected to be between $65 million and $68 million, which includes $28 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense.
For 2018 interest expense will be approximately $40 million, including approximately $19 million of noncash interest expense related to the CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalty monetization. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration. And that's both in terms of the frequency, even the dose volume, even the relationship of dose to properties of the tumor, such as the tumor size, the tumor's age and even some of the underlying composition of the cells inside the tumor. So we took all that into consideration when we went and did all of the IND-enabling nonclinical toxicology studies, which then further allowed us to pick a starting dose, which we could justify based on all of those parameters that I just described as well as the overall toxicology assessment that's required by the FDA before you open a first-in-human trial. So all of that was considered to pick our starting dose. And I'll give a little bit more color on that also in the way we've designed the clinical trial, injecting either 1 or 2 tumors on any occasion of intratumoral administration. So this is very different than, say something like T VAC [indiscernible] or you could be injecting 10 or more tumors in any given time. So this is very different approach than that. And also, the frequency of that injection is either once or on a 21-day cycle, we have a chance to dose a few times and restage the patients as needed. So it's a very almost minimalistic amount of intratumoral administration, which we think is going to be very key to the overall success of NKTR-262. And then in terms of the combination with NKTR-214, the philosophy there is that we know that any immune action of the immune system has to end with a faithful hand off from the innate -- to the adaptive immune response. And that initial innate response, which is not antigen specific then switches to be antigen-specific at the adaptive level. And so the whole kind of science behind this combination is that when you co-administer the 2 agents, in particular, having NKTR-214 on board after the IV administration it really increases the efficiency of that innate to adaptive handoff. And it actually really increases the number of antigen reactive T cells and then those can go off and give you an abscopal response, really targeting any tumor in the patient, even the tumors that are very far away from the few that were injected."

Look as you know, there are no other drugs like, in development like NKTR-214. Everybody is now jumping on the isle 2 bandwagon. But the fact of the matter is, there is nothing else in clinical development that looks like NKTR-214. And as you could also imagine, there are many, many companies that are highly interested in combining NKTR-214 with their unique molecules. I don't know that I expect significant upfront money to change hands here. I don't think that's what we are looking for. I don't think that's a priority for us at this moment. I think the most important thing we could do is find the right partners, whether they would be small molecules, whether they be vaccines, there is a range of things. Let's find the right partner with the best potential opportunity, and let's figure out how to work with that part is to combine NKTR-214 with their technology and show that NKTR-214 genuinely is the centerpiece of immuno-oncology. On the second question with regard to NKTR-181, look, again, clearly, I don't want to suggest that money is not important. It is very, very important. Cash is very, very important. But at this point, we have -- we are probably in better shape than most biotech companies. And I think we can gain a lot by nurturing NKTR-181 through the regulatory process. And the further it goes through the regulatory process, the more likely it is that we can build even value on top of what we've already built. We've had -- our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA were excellent. The FDA is very supportive and has been extremely collaborative in helping us move NKTR-181 forward. And as I said, we have agreement with them that we'll be filing NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. And they're taking a very close look at what it would be to give it a scheduling that's better than Schedule II. So we are very happy about that we expect to do the filing. And at this point, we are talking to companies and we are evaluating other possibilities and other strategic structures that could bring NKTR 181 to patients. I can tell you that NKTR Therapeutics has no intention of marketing NKTR-181. That is not our expertise. We are immuno-oncology, immunology company and that's where we're going to focus our efforts. But there are all kind of strategic structures, there is all kinds of potential collaborations with companies that we are discussing. And I'm hopeful that we will get this patient -- destructed patients rather rapidly. As I said, Steve and I were invited to and we attended the opioid summit at the White House today. We are actually in Washington, right now, that's why we are in different locations. And there is no doubt that a drug like NKTR-181 has the potential to be a major component of the solution for the opioid crisis. No doubt about that. So we're looking at all the possibilities.

Now that said, we are looking at a number of different collaborations where it's genuinely, we put NKTR-214, the company puts in their molecule and we see how that develops. But I would not rule out the possibility of acquiring something if it made sense. But we would have to -- you don't get many shots at that. You have to do it very carefully and very cleverly. And you have to make sure that whatever you do acquire is something you really want to put your stake in the ground with.

They then make a recommendation that comes out of CSS to the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. And that happens around the time immediately after approval.

I'll -- first, let me touch on the first part of your question which is, how do you -- what's the market for a drug that dosed just a few times. I think look, if you have an important drug like NKTR-262, I think everybody understands that CLR 78 agonist is potentially very, very important in immuno-oncology but of course, it can be delivered systemically. If you give it systematically, I think the side effect profile would be significantly problematic. On the other hand, when you combine it with 214, you do get the abscopal affects and that's I think is very, very important program. Now I don't want to talk about what the market potential is because you have to talk about pricing and I don't think we are ready to do that yet, given the early stage of development. But clearly, what this allows us to have is a Nektar wholly-owned combination. So it means that we have NKTR-214 and NKTR-262, of course, I said 262 and 214, because 262 theoretically comes first in the cascade. So with that wholly-owned combination, maybe there is no need for a checkpoint inhibitor with that combination. So we have to see how that plays out. We have to see how that evolves. And depending on the efficacy that we see from that and how valuable that combination is, it'll create a market for itself. With regard to the safety profile, I'll let Mary go into some detail. But I think, it's very important to note, no one has dropped off of NKTR-214 studies because of safety issues. Not a single patient has stopped therapy because of safety. That's an important distinction. Please follow through, Mary."

The most common symptoms that we see are flu-like symptoms tend to occur in the first cycle. And as patients are treated with subsequent cycle, patients really become more polarized and -- to the cytokine and do not have flu-like symptoms as they progress through treatment. The physicians really appreciate this because it is easy to manage the patients. About 24 to 48 hours after dosing, patients can expect to have fever and they take Tylenol or NSAID and it's resolved very quickly in a couple of days. And the predictability of the side effect profile is very much appreciated by both the physicians and patients alike. Again, we don't have discontinuations. Discontinuation rate is as high as 20% in these clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors. And so we are very pleased that patients can tolerate treatment, as Howard said."

Thank you to everyone for joining us today for our year-end 2017 conference call.
On today's call, we will review the many upcoming milestones for Nektar's pipeline over the next month, including our planned submission for an NDA for Nektar 181 in the second quarter, and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214, NKTR-26 and NKTR-255. We will also provide our financial guidance for 2018.
2017 was a truly transformational year for our company. We achieved major successes on multiple fronts with Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: pain, immuno-oncology and immunology. This is a singular set of achievements that is truly remarkable and is the combination of many years of hard work and scientific innovation by the Nektar team.
In the area of chronic pain, all Phase III trials of NKTR-181 were successful; the efficacy study in patients, the long-term safety study in patients and the pivotal human abuse liability study conducted in recreational drug users. This successful and comprehensive Phase III development program will enable us to submit an NDA package for NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. 
In immuno-oncology, we developed a highly valuable and highly-focused strategy, which resulted in a pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. We now have a strong pipeline in immuno-oncology NKTR-214, NKTR-262 and NKTR-255. We've had compelling results with our lead I-O program, NKTR-214, in terms of clinical efficacy, safety and supporting translational science, which led to our recent strategic collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. The collaboration enables us to develop NKTR-214 broadly and rapidly, in order to establish it as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications.
And in immunology, we opened the IND and began clinical development with NKTR-358, a first-in-class T reg targeting resolution therapeutic to treat autoimmune disease.
Our preclinical success with NKTR-358 led to an extensive partnership with Eli Lilly to develop NKTR-358 for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Based upon the proof of mechanism results observed to date in a single-ascending dose first-in-human trial, NKTR-358 is now advancing into lupus patients in a multiple ascending dose study, which we plan to begin in the second quarter of this year. 
I don't know of any other company at our stage of development to have this number of substantial and successful achievements in a single year. And I'm very proud of our employees. 
First, let's review the substantial progress we've made with NKTR-181. In the past 2 months, we've had 2 highly productive pre-NDA meetings with the agency to discuss our clinical, nonclinical and CMC data packages that will go into our NDA submission. As you know, our NDA data package includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. This includes our 600-patient Phase III efficacy trial, our 2 human abuse potential studies and our 630-patient Phase III long-term safety study, which also included long-term measurements of pain control as well as a wide range of PK and PD studies of therapeutic and super therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in over 450 healthy subjects. 
The FDA staff gave us clear and collaborative guidance on the expectations for completion of our NDA submission. An agreement was reached to file the package in the second quarter of this year. The agency further confirmed that Nektar has an adequate abuse potential assessment data package and that together with the safety population, the data appear to be adequate to warrant a discussion of a less restrictive scheduling than Schedule II. As I said earlier, we're on track to submit the NDA for filing in the second quarter of this year.
NKTR-181 has emerged not only as a critically important new potential medicine to treat patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but also as an important component of a solution to address the opioid public health emergency.
This afternoon, Steve and I were invited to and participated in the opioid submit at the White House, which focused on the treatment of addiction in our country and the education, prevention and treatment of pain patients in light of the current opioid epidemic we are facing. A key theme of this event was the importance of providing pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs. As the first new full new opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medications for abuse.
We strongly believe that we could add more value to NKTR-181 through the continuing regulatory process. We believe NKTR-181 is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction, and we are highly focused on the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval. We are actively evaluating potential licensing to commercial partners or other strategic structural alternatives that -- while we advance the regulatory process.
Finally, we are very pleased to announce today that 2 NKTR-181 abstracts were accepted for oral presentation at the upcoming 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting for the college of problems of drug dependence, which will be held in San Diego the week of June 9. The first presentation will feature results from our dopamine microdialysis animal models, which show that NKTR-181 does not create the same dopamine surge in the brain's reward center as is observed with standard opioids.
The second presentation will review new positive data from our Phase III efficacy study from an important exploratory end point related to assessing the abuse potential of the medicine. The end point used in new measurement tool called Matters, which was developed with the FDA action public-private partnership initiative in order to quantify potential abuse related events in clinical trials. The Matters tool was specifically developed to generate evidence to support approval, labeling and scheduling decisions for new medicines.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the global leader in immuno-oncology. This new collaboration is a major strategic step forward for our company in order to establish Nektar as a new leader in the immuno-oncology field. The collaboration's broad clinical development program ensures that we could advance this new potential medicine to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. As you know, Nektar will book all global revenue, and we will keep 65% of global profits for NKTR-214. We will also receive an upfront payment of $1 billion and a premium equity investment of $850 million at $102.60 per share. We expect the collaboration to commence in the second quarter once the HSR review period ends.
Since we have the flexibility to pursue other combination possibilities, we maintain pricing and distribution control for NKTR-214 and our partner has committed to pay 2/3 of the collaborations development costs. We now have the right foundation in place to maximize the value of NKTR-214. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar will be initiating over 20 registrational-enabling studies that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types. These trials will start within the first 14 months of the collaboration. And the first 2 Phase III studies, which Bristol will start in the middle of this year will be conducted in patients with first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma. We plan to share the design of these trials later this year at ASCO.
At ASCO, we will also share our first presentation of data from the second part of the ongoing PIVOT study of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo known as the expansion stage.
At JP Morgan, I provided an update on the patients from the first part of the ongoing PIVOT study, the 38 patients from the dose escalation stage. To remind you, the response rates we reported at JP Morgan were 75% response in second line I-O naïve non-small-cell lung cancer, a 64% response rate in first-line I-O naïve melanoma patients and a 57% response rate in first-line I-O naïve renal cell carcinoma patients. 
Further, all of the partial and complete responses observed in the dose escalation stage of the trial has been confirmed, and we see ongoing tumor shrinkage. And all patients with responses from dose escalation continue on treatment. Importantly, there have been no patients with responses who relapsed in any of the tumor types. This highlights that the length of time patients spend on treatment with the combination of NKTR-214 plus nivolumab is correlated with further tumor shrinkage and improved and continued response.
Specifically, I want to take a moment to focus on the improvement in response over time for the 14 patients with the first -- with first-line renal cell carcinoma. When we initially presented the first-line RCC dose escalation data at the SITC Conference in November of last year, the response rate was 46%. As I've just said 2 months later at the time of JP Morgan, the response rate was 57%. Today, we're pleased to report that we have additional patients with stable disease that converted to responders, which means we now have a 71% response rate in first-line RCC with all patients with responses confirmed in ongoing treatment.
There is also one additional patient in the first-line RCC with stable disease who is still on treatment as well. That patient had experienced tumor reduction and also has a potential to convert to respond. Across the entire 38 patients in dose escalation in all tumor types, we now see a confirmed 60% overall response rate in the 20 patients with baseline PD-L1 negative status. In addition, our safety profile across the entire PIVOT population continues to be encouraging with no patients discontinuing because of treatment-related AEs and a low 11% G3 adverse event rate and over 150 patients treated to date. 
As I've just stated at ASCO, we will present the first data from the second expansion stage of the study. The PIVOT study continues to enroll patients into the second expansion stage. As you will recall, we plan to enroll 330 patients into 13 different expansion cohorts that spanned 5 different tumor types. We expect to complete enrollment for the first 5 tumor types by the end of the third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, we will add 3 new expansion cohorts to PIVOT; gastric, colorectal and small cell lung cancer. We will begin enrollment very shortly after the HSR review period.
As we retain the ability to develop NKTR-214 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, we plan to initiate additional development collaborations this year. This will ensure that we maximize our potentials to rapidly establish NKTR-214 as the future backbone of immuno-oncology therapy.
Today, we have several Nektar-214 combination programs underway in nonclinical tumor models, including a collaboration with Takeda with 5 different targets as well as vaccine and other small molecule programs. Based on the positive results from multiple preclinical studies, we expect to advance several new combinations into the clinic this year.
At the upcoming AACR conference in April, we will present 4 separate nonclinical data sets for NKTR-214, including a combination of NKTR-214 with an HDAC inhibitor in models of renal and colon cancer. And a combination of NKTR-214 with an adoptive T cell transplant approach, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Toni Ribas. It is important to note that Bristol-Myers Squibb -- that the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration puts us in a very strong financial position and allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TOR 78 agonist and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate that can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. The preclinical data for the Nektar 214, 262 combination are particularly compelling. And we're on track to dose the first patient in the novel-novel combination trial of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214 this month. The trial will enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
The first stage of the trial will assess the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. In the second stage of the trial, we have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have the initial data from this trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As I stated earlier, with success in the Phase Ia single ascending dose trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 is now slated to enter Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus in the second quarter of this year. This Phase Ib study will enroll approximately 50 patients and will evaluate safety and biomarkers of NKTR-358. With a 12-week treatment period, we expect the trial duration to be 18 to 24 months with initial data sometime in 2019.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Gil to provide financial guidance for 2018."

I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we ex",869,"Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.
Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we expect this growth of our royalty revenue to continue in 2018. Our royalty revenue for 2017 was approximately $33.5 million, which represents a 72% increase from 2016.
On January 15, 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ADYNOVATE as ADYNOVATE is known in Europe, enabling patient access to ADYNOVATE throughout Europe beginning this year.
As a result of this European approval, we will recognize a $10 million milestone in Q1 of this year.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. First, starting with our cash position. Including the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration, we expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion. For 2018 GAAP revenue, our guidance for revenue outside of the payments from the Bristol collaboration, is between $100 million and $110 million, which we expect to be ratable over the four quarters of 2018, with the exception of the $10 million milestone payment for the European approval of ADYNOVATE that we will recognize this quarter.
With respect to the BMS collaboration, we expect to receive the upfront payments when HSR review period ends, which we estimate will occur in the second quarter of this year. While we currently anticipate that a portion of the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration will likely be recognized in 2018, we are working closely with our independent auditors to determine the new GAAP ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting principle will apply to the BMS collaboration payments.
We expect to complete this analysis and provide our final assessment of revenue recognition for the BMS collaboration on our Q1 quarterly financial results call. In the meantime, we recommend for modeling purposes to include a placeholder of $125 million in revenue to be recognized in Q2 of 2018 for the BMS collaboration.
We anticipate 2017 -- 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We expect to incur R&D expense on a fairly ratable basis over the four quarters of 2018. There are a few key points that I want to highlight for our 2018 R&D investment plan.
Our plans for the NKTR-214 development program include substantially completing enrollment in all of the current PIVOT expansion cohorts by the third quarter of this year, a goal BMS and Nektar were already working towards under our current clinical trial collaboration agreement. In connection with our new collaboration agreement, after the conclusion of the HSR review period, we and BMS plans to start at least 20 registrational trials within 14 months after the collaboration is effective.
Our plan includes the start of Phase III studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma by mid-2018 as well as other indications in the second half of 2018. After the collaboration is effective, we will work closely with BMS to continue planning the operational execution activities for the broad joint clinical development campaign that is outlined in our collaboration. Keep in mind, that under our BMS strategic collaboration agreement, our cash outlay is subject to an annual cap of $125 million in GAAP development expenses, which will be pro rated for 2018 from the closing date of the agreement.
While we will continue to recognize GAAP R&D expense for NKTR-214 to the extent such expenses exceed the $125 million annual payment GAAP, BMS will reimburse Nektar for all development cost in excess of the annual cap under our quarterly reconciliation process.
For NKTR-358, our plans include the start of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in lupus patients in the second quarter of 2018. As you will recall, after the conclusion of the Phase Ib study, Eli Lilly will then lead the development program for NKTR-358 from Phase II through regulatory approval with Nektar being a codevelopment partner.
Later this month, we will commence our Phase I clinical study for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214, with an enrollment schedule that should allow us to establish our Phase II recommended dose and share initial data from the study before the end of this year.
We also continue to advance the NKTR-255 program towards an IND filing, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2019. For NKTR-181, we plan to make a significant investment this year to advance NKTR-181 through the FDA approval process, including the planned NDA filing in Q2, drug-drug interaction studies needed to finalize labeling, CMC stability studies as well as manufacturing the initial commercial launch supplies. 
G&A expense for 2018 is projected to be between $65 million and $68 million, which includes $28 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense.
For 2018 interest expense will be approximately $40 million, including approximately $19 million of noncash interest expense related to the CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalty monetization. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration. And that's both in terms of the frequency, even the dose volume, even the relationship of dose to properties of the tumor, such as the tumor size, the tumor's age and even some of the underlying composition of the cells inside the tumor. So we took all that into consideration when we went and did all of the IND-enabling nonclinical toxicology studies, which then further allowed us to pick a starting dose, which we could justify based on all of those parameters that I just described as well as the overall toxicology assessment that's required by the FDA before you open a first-in-human trial. So all of that was considered to pick our starting dose. And I'll give a little bit more color on that also in the way we've designed the clinical trial, injecting either 1 or 2 tumors on any occasion of intratumoral administration. So this is very different than, say something like T VAC, where you could be injecting 10 or more tumors in any given time. So this is very different approach than that. And also, the frequency of that injection is either once or on a 21-day cycle, we have a chance to dose a few times and restage the patients as needed. So it's a very almost minimalistic amount of intratumoral administration, which we think is going to be very key to the overall success of NKTR-262. And then in terms of the combination with NKTR-214, the philosophy there is that we know that any immune action of the immune system has to end with a faithful handoff from the innate -- to the adaptive immune response. And that initial innate response, which is not antigen specific then switches to be antigen-specific at the adaptive level. And so the whole kind of science behind this combination is that when you co-administer the 2 agents, in particular, having NKTR-214 on board after the IV administration it really increases the efficiency of that innate to adaptive handoff. And it actually really increases the number of antigen reactive T cells and then those can go off and give you an abscopal response, really targeting any tumor in the patient, even the tumors that are very far away from the few that were injected."

Look as you know, there are no other drugs like, in development like NKTR-214. Everybody is now jumping on the [ isle ] 2 bandwagon. But the fact of the matter is, there is nothing else in clinical development that looks like NKTR-214. And as you could also imagine, there are many, many companies that are highly interested in combining NKTR-214 with their unique molecules. I don't know that I expect significant upfront money to change hands here. I don't think that's what we are looking for. I don't think that's a priority for us at this moment. I think the most important thing we could do is find the right partners, whether they would be small molecules, whether they be vaccines, there is a range of things. Let's find the right partner with the best potential opportunity, and let's figure out how to work with that part is to combine NKTR-214 with their technology and show that NKTR-214 genuinely is the centerpiece of immuno-oncology. On the second question with regard to NKTR-181, look, again, clearly, I don't want to suggest that money is not important. It is very, very important. Cash is very, very important. But at this point, we have -- we are probably in better shape than most biotech companies. And I think we can gain a lot by nurturing NKTR-181 through the regulatory process. And the further it goes through the regulatory process, the more likely it is that we can build even value on top of what we've already built. We've had -- our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA were excellent. The FDA is very supportive and has been extremely collaborative in helping us move NKTR-181 forward. And as I said, we have agreement with them that we'll be filing NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. And they're taking a very close look at what it would be to give it a scheduling that's better than Schedule II. So we are very happy about that we expect to do the filing. And at this point, we are talking to companies and we are evaluating other possibilities and other strategic structures that could bring NKTR 181 to patients. I can tell you that NKTR Therapeutics has no intention of marketing NKTR-181. That is not our expertise. We are immuno-oncology, immunology company and that's where we're going to focus our efforts. But there are all kind of strategic structures, there is all kinds of potential collaborations with companies that we are discussing. And I'm hopeful that we will get this patient -- [ disdrug ] the patients, [ disdrug ] the patients rather rapidly. As I said, Steve and I were invited to and we attended the opioid summit at the White House today. We are actually in Washington, right now, that's why we are in different locations. And there is no doubt that a drug like NKTR-181 has the potential to be a major component of the solution for the opioid crisis. No doubt about that. So we're looking at all the possibilities.

It's just that they like what they've seen so far. And now, that is a very big discussion that happens within FDA during review of the NDA between the division and the controlled substances staff. They then make a recommendation that comes out of CSS to the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. And that happens around the time immediately after approval. So it's actually quite a while before we understand what the scheduling is really going to be for NKTR-181. At least we have the data in place now that makes that discussion relevant within FDA. That's the guidance we've been given."

I'll -- first, let me touch on the first part of your question which is, how do you -- what's the market for a drug that dosed just a few times. I think look, if you have an important drug like NKTR-262, I think everybody understands that CLR 78 agonist is potentially very, very important in immuno-oncology but of course, it can be delivered systemically. If you give it systematically, I think the side effect profile would be significantly problematic. On the other hand, when you combine it with 214, you do get the abscopal affects and that's I think is very, very important program. Now I don't want to talk about what the market potential is because you have to talk about pricing and I don't think we are ready to do that yet, given the early stage of development. But clearly, what this allows us to have is a Nektar wholly-owned combination. So it means that we have NKTR-214 and NKTR-262, of course, I said 262 and 214, because 262 theoretically comes first in the cascade. So with that wholly-owned combination, maybe there is no need for a checkpoint inhibitor with that combination. So we have to see how that plays out. We have to see how that evolves. And depending on the efficacy that we see from that and how valuable that combination is, it'll create a market for itself. With regard to the safety profile, I'll let Mary go into some detail. But I think, it's very important to note, no one has dropped off of NKTR-214 studies because of safety issues. Not a single patient has stopped therapy because of safety. That's an important distinction. Please follow through, Mary."

The most common symptoms that we see are flu-like symptoms tend to occur in the first cycle. And as patients are treated with subsequent cycle, patients really become more polarized and -- to the cytokine and do not have flu-like symptoms as they progress through treatment. The physicians really appreciate this because it is easy to manage the patients. About 24 to 48 hours after dosing, patients can expect to have fever and they take Tylenol or NSAID and it's resolved very quickly in a couple of days. And the predictability of the side effect profile is very much appreciated by both the physicians and patients alike. Again, we don't have discontinuations. Discontinuation rate is as high as 20% in these clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors. And so we are very pleased that patients can tolerate treatment, as Howard said."

Thank you to everyone for joining us today for our year-end 2017 conference call.
On today's call, we will review the many upcoming milestones for Nektar's pipeline over the next month, including our planned submission for an NDA for Nektar 181 in the second quarter, and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214, NKTR-26 and NKTR-255. We will also provide our financial guidance for 2018.
2017 was a truly transformational year for our company. We achieved major successes on multiple fronts with Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: pain, immuno-oncology and immunology. This is a singular set of achievements that is truly remarkable and is the combination of many years of hard work and scientific innovation by the Nektar team.
In the area of chronic pain, all Phase III trials of NKTR-181 were successful; the efficacy study in patients, the long-term safety study in patients and the pivotal human abuse liability study conducted in recreational drug users. This successful and comprehensive Phase III development program will enable us to submit an NDA package for NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. 
In immuno-oncology, we developed a highly valuable and highly-focused strategy, which resulted in a pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. We now have a strong pipeline in immuno-oncology NKTR-214, NKTR-262 and NKTR-255. We've had compelling results with our lead I-O program, NKTR-214, in terms of clinical efficacy, safety and supporting translational science, which led to our recent strategic collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. The collaboration enables us to develop NKTR-214 broadly and rapidly, in order to establish it as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications.
And in immunology, we opened the IND and began clinical development with NKTR-358, a first-in-class T reg targeting resolution therapeutic to treat autoimmune disease.
Our preclinical success with NKTR-358 led to an extensive partnership with Eli Lilly to develop NKTR-358 for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Based upon the proof of mechanism results observed to date in a single-ascending dose first-in-human trial, NKTR-358 is now advancing into lupus patients in a multiple ascending dose study, which we plan to begin in the second quarter of this year. 
I don't know of any other company at our stage of development to have this number of substantial and successful achievements in a single year. And I'm very proud of our employees. 
First, let's review the substantial progress we've made with NKTR-181. In the past 2 months, we've had 2 highly productive pre-NDA meetings with the agency to discuss our clinical, nonclinical and CMC data packages that will go into our NDA submission. As you know, our NDA data package includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. This includes our 600-patient Phase III efficacy trial, our 2 human abuse potential studies and our 630-patient Phase III long-term safety study, which also included long-term measurements of pain control as well as a wide range of PK and PD studies of therapeutic and super therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in over 450 healthy subjects. 
The FDA staff gave us clear and collaborative guidance on the expectations for completion of our NDA submission. An agreement was reached to file the package in the second quarter of this year. The agency further confirmed that Nektar has an adequate abuse potential assessment data package and that together with the safety population, the data appear to be adequate to warrant a discussion of a less restrictive scheduling than Schedule II. As I said earlier, we're on track to submit the NDA for filing in the second quarter of this year.
NKTR-181 has emerged not only as a critically important new potential medicine to treat patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but also as an important component of a solution to address the opioid public health emergency.
This afternoon, Steve and I were invited to and participated in the opioid submit at the White House, which focused on the treatment of addiction in our country and the education, prevention and treatment of pain patients in light of the current opioid epidemic we are facing. A key theme of this event was the importance of providing pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs. As the first new full new opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medications for abuse.
We strongly believe that we could add more value to NKTR-181 through the continuing regulatory process. We believe NKTR-181 is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction, and we are highly focused on the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval. We are actively evaluating potential licensing to commercial partners or other strategic structural alternatives that -- while we advance the regulatory process.
Finally, we are very pleased to announce today that 2 NKTR-181 abstracts were accepted for oral presentation at the upcoming 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting for the college of problems of drug dependence, which will be held in San Diego the week of June 9. The first presentation will feature results from our dopamine microdialysis animal models, which show that NKTR-181 does not create the same dopamine surge in the brain's reward center as is observed with standard opioids.
The second presentation will review new positive data from our Phase III efficacy study from an important exploratory end point related to assessing the abuse potential of the medicine. The end point used in new measurement tool called Matters, which was developed with the FDA action public-private partnership initiative in order to quantify potential abuse related events in clinical trials. The Matters tool was specifically developed to generate evidence to support approval, labeling and scheduling decisions for new medicines.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the global leader in immuno-oncology. This new collaboration is a major strategic step forward for our company in order to establish Nektar as a new leader in the immuno-oncology field. The collaboration's broad clinical development program ensures that we could advance this new potential medicine to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. As you know, Nektar will book all global revenue, and we will keep 65% of global profits for NKTR-214. We will also receive an upfront payment of $1 billion and a premium equity investment of $850 million at $102.60 per share. We expect the collaboration to commence in the second quarter once the HSR review period ends.
Since we have the flexibility to pursue other combination possibilities, we maintain pricing and distribution control for NKTR-214 and our partner has committed to pay 2/3 of the collaborations development costs. We now have the right foundation in place to maximize the value of NKTR-214. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar will be initiating over 20 registrational-enabling studies that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types. These trials will start within the first 14 months of the collaboration. And the first 2 Phase III studies, which Bristol will start in the middle of this year will be conducted in patients with first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma. We plan to share the design of these trials later this year at ASCO.
At ASCO, we will also share our first presentation of data from the second part of the ongoing PIVOT study of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo known as the expansion stage.
At JP Morgan, I provided an update on the patients from the first part of the ongoing PIVOT study, the 38 patients from the dose escalation stage. To remind you, the response rates we reported at JP Morgan were 75% response in second line I-O naïve non-small-cell lung cancer, a 64% response rate in first-line I-O naïve melanoma patients and a 57% response rate in first-line I-O naïve renal cell carcinoma patients. 
Further, all of the partial and complete responses observed in the dose escalation stage of the trial has been confirmed, and we see ongoing tumor shrinkage. And all patients with responses from dose escalation continue on treatment. Importantly, there have been no patients with responses who relapsed in any of the tumor types. This highlights that the length of time patients spend on treatment with the combination of NKTR-214 plus nivolumab is correlated with further tumor shrinkage and improved and continued response.
Specifically, I want to take a moment to focus on the improvement in response over time for the 14 patients with the first -- with first-line renal cell carcinoma. When we initially presented the first-line RCC dose escalation data at the SITC Conference in November of last year, the response rate was 46%. As I've just said 2 months later at the time of JP Morgan, the response rate was 57%. Today, we're pleased to report that we have additional patients with stable disease that converted to responders, which means we now have a 71% response rate in first-line RCC with all patients with responses confirmed in ongoing treatment.
There is also one additional patient in the first-line RCC with stable disease who is still on treatment as well. That patient had experienced tumor reduction and also has a potential to convert to respond. Across the entire 38 patients in dose escalation in all tumor types, we now see a confirmed 60% overall response rate in the 20 patients with baseline PD-L1 negative status. In addition, our safety profile across the entire PIVOT population continues to be encouraging with no patients discontinuing because of treatment-related AEs and a low 11% G3 adverse event rate and over 150 patients treated to date. 
As I've just stated at ASCO, we will present the first data from the second expansion stage of the study. The PIVOT study continues to enroll patients into the second expansion stage. As you will recall, we plan to enroll 330 patients into 13 different expansion cohorts that spanned 5 different tumor types. We expect to complete enrollment for the first 5 tumor types by the end of the third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, we will add 3 new expansion cohorts to PIVOT; gastric, colorectal and small cell lung cancer. We will begin enrollment very shortly after the HSR review period.
As we retain the ability to develop NKTR-214 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, we plan to initiate additional development collaborations this year. This will ensure that we maximize our potentials to rapidly establish NKTR-214 as the future backbone of immuno-oncology therapy.
Today, we have several Nektar-214 combination programs underway in nonclinical tumor models, including a collaboration with Takeda with 5 different targets as well as vaccine and other small molecule programs. Based on the positive results from multiple preclinical studies, we expect to advance several new combinations into the clinic this year.
At the upcoming AACR conference in April, we will present 4 separate nonclinical data sets for NKTR-214, including a combination of NKTR-214 with an HDAC inhibitor in models of renal and colon cancer. And a combination of NKTR-214 with an adoptive T cell transplant approach, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Toni Ribas. It is important to note that Bristol-Myers Squibb -- that the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration puts us in a very strong financial position and allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TOR 78 agonist and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate that can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. The preclinical data for the Nektar 214, 262 combination are particularly compelling. And we're on track to dose the first patient in the novel-novel combination trial of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214 this month. The trial will enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
The first stage of the trial will assess the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. In the second stage of the trial, we have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have the initial data from this trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As I stated earlier, with success in the Phase Ia single ascending dose trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 is now slated to enter Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus in the second quarter of this year. This Phase Ib study will enroll approximately 50 patients and will evaluate safety and biomarkers of NKTR-358. With a 12-week treatment period, we expect the trial duration to be 18 to 24 months with initial data sometime in 2019.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Gil to provide financial guidance for 2018."

I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we ex",868,"Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a few points on the progress of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE, and then I'll review our 2018 financial guidance.
Our royalty revenue from MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE continues to grow nicely. And we expect this growth of our royalty revenue to continue in 2018. Our royalty revenue for 2017 was approximately $33.5 million, which represents a 72% increase from 2016.
On January 15, 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ADYNOVATE as ADYNOVATE is known in Europe, enabling patient access to ADYNOVATE throughout Europe beginning this year.
As a result of this European approval, we will recognize a $10 million milestone in Q1 of this year.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. First, starting with our cash position. Including the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration, we expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion. For 2018 GAAP revenue, our guidance for revenue outside of the payments from the Bristol collaboration, is between $100 million and $110 million, which we expect to be ratable over the four quarters of 2018, with the exception of the $10 million milestone payment for the European approval of ADYNOVATE that we will recognize this quarter.
With respect to the BMS collaboration, we expect to receive the upfront payments when HSR review period ends, which we estimate will occur in the second quarter of this year. While we currently anticipate that a portion of the upfront payments from the BMS collaboration will likely be recognized in 2018, we are working closely with our independent auditors to determine the new GAAP ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting principle will apply to the BMS collaboration payments.
We expect to complete this analysis and provide our final assessment of revenue recognition for the BMS collaboration on our Q1 quarterly financial results call. In the meantime, we recommend for modeling purposes to include a placeholder of $125 million in revenue to be recognized in Q2 of 2018 for the BMS collaboration.
We anticipate 2017 -- 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We expect to incur R&D expense on a fairly ratable basis over the four quarters of 2018. There are a few key points that I want to highlight for our 2018 R&D investment plan.
Our plans for the NKTR-214 development program include substantially completing enrollment in all of the current PIVOT expansion cohorts by the third quarter of this year, a goal BMS and Nektar were already working towards under our current clinical trial collaboration agreement. In connection with our new collaboration agreement, after the conclusion of the HSR review period, we and BMS plans to start at least 20 registrational trials within 14 months after the collaboration is effective.
Our plan includes the start of Phase III studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma by mid-2018 as well as other indications in the second half of 2018. After the collaboration is effective, we will work closely with BMS to continue planning the operational execution activities for the broad joint clinical development campaign that is outlined in our collaboration. Keep in mind, that under our BMS strategic collaboration agreement, our cash outlay is subject to an annual cap of $125 million in GAAP development expenses, which will be prorated for 2018 from the closing date of the agreement.
While we will continue to recognize GAAP R&D expense for NKTR-214 to the extent such expenses exceed the $125 million annual payment GAAP, BMS will reimburse Nektar for all development cost in excess of the annual cap under our quarterly reconciliation process.
For NKTR-358, our plans include the start of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in lupus patients in the second quarter of 2018. As you will recall, after the conclusion of the Phase Ib study, Eli Lilly will then lead the development program for NKTR-358 from Phase II through regulatory approval with Nektar being a codevelopment partner.
Later this month, we will commence our Phase I clinical study for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214, with an enrollment schedule that should allow us to establish our Phase II recommended dose and share initial data from the study before the end of this year.
We also continue to advance the NKTR-255 program towards an IND filing, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2019. For NKTR-181, we plan to make a significant investment this year to advance NKTR-181 through the FDA approval process, including the planned NDA filing in Q2, drug-drug interaction studies needed to finalize labeling, CMC stability studies as well as manufacturing the initial commercial launch supplies. 
G&A expense for 2018 is projected to be between $65 million and $68 million, which includes $28 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense.
For 2018 interest expense will be approximately $40 million, including approximately $19 million of noncash interest expense related to the CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalty monetization. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

So definitely, the preclinical models that we ran allowed us to understand the nature of the dose administration. And that's both in terms of the frequency, even the dose volume, even the relationship of dose to properties of the tumor, such as the tumor size, the tumor's age and even some of the underlying composition of the cells inside the tumor. So we took all that into consideration when we went and did all of the IND-enabling nonclinical toxicology studies, which then further allowed us to pick a starting dose, which we could justify based on all of those parameters that I just described as well as the overall toxicology assessment that's required by the FDA before you open a first-in-human trial. So all of that was considered to pick our starting dose. And I'll give a little bit more color on that also in the way we've designed the clinical trial, injecting either 1 or 2 tumors on any occasion of intratumoral administration. So this is very different than, say something like T VAC, where you could be injecting 10 or more tumors in any given time. So this is very different approach than that. And also, the frequency of that injection is either once or on a 21-day cycle, we have a chance to dose a few times and restage the patients as needed. So it's a very almost minimalistic amount of intratumoral administration, which we think is going to be very key to the overall success of NKTR-262. And then in terms of the combination with NKTR-214, the philosophy there is that we know that any immune action of the immune system has to end with a faithful handoff from the innate -- to the adaptive immune response. And that initial innate response, which is not antigen specific then switches to be antigen-specific at the adaptive level. And so the whole kind of science behind this combination is that when you co-administer the 2 agents, in particular, having NKTR-214 on board after the IV administration it really increases the efficiency of that innate to adaptive handoff. And it actually really increases the number of antigen reactive T cells and then those can go off and give you an abscopal response, really targeting any tumor in the patient, even the tumors that are very far away from the few that were injected."

Look as you know, there are no other drugs like, in development like NKTR-214. Everybody is now jumping on the [ isle ] 2 bandwagon. But the fact of the matter is, there is nothing else in clinical development that looks like NKTR-214. And as you could also imagine, there are many, many companies that are highly interested in combining NKTR-214 with their unique molecules. I don't know that I expect significant upfront money to change hands here. I don't think that's what we are looking for. I don't think that's a priority for us at this moment. I think the most important thing we could do is find the right partners, whether they would be small molecules, whether they be vaccines, there is a range of things. Let's find the right partner with the best potential opportunity, and let's figure out how to work with that part is to combine NKTR-214 with their technology and show that NKTR-214 genuinely is the centerpiece of immuno-oncology. On the second question with regard to NKTR-181, look, again, clearly, I don't want to suggest that money is not important. It is very, very important. Cash is very, very important. But at this point, we have -- we are probably in better shape than most biotech companies. And I think we can gain a lot by nurturing NKTR-181 through the regulatory process. And the further it goes through the regulatory process, the more likely it is that we can build even value on top of what we've already built. We've had -- our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA were excellent. The FDA is very supportive and has been extremely collaborative in helping us move NKTR-181 forward. And as I said, we have agreement with them that we'll be filing NKTR-181 in the second quarter of this year. And they're taking a very close look at what it would be to give it a scheduling that's better than Schedule II. So we are very happy about that we expect to do the filing. And at this point, we are talking to companies and we are evaluating other possibilities and other strategic structures that could bring NKTR 181 to patients. I can tell you that NKTR Therapeutics has no intention of marketing NKTR-181. That is not our expertise. We are immuno-oncology, immunology company and that's where we're going to focus our efforts. But there are all kind of strategic structures, there is all kinds of potential collaborations with companies that we are discussing. And I'm hopeful that we will get this patient -- [ disdrug ] the patients, [ disdrug ] the patients rather rapidly. As I said, Steve and I were invited to and we attended the opioid summit at the White House today. We are actually in Washington, right now, that's why we are in different locations. And there is no doubt that a drug like NKTR-181 has the potential to be a major component of the solution for the opioid crisis. No doubt about that. So we're looking at all the possibilities.

I'll -- first, let me touch on the first part of your question which is, how do you -- what's the market for a drug that dosed just a few times. I think look, if you have an important drug like NKTR-262, I think everybody understands that CLR 78 agonist is potentially very, very important in immuno-oncology but of course, it can be delivered systemically. If you give it systematically, I think the side effect profile would be significantly problematic. On the other hand, when you combine it with 214, you do get the abscopal affects and that's I think is very, very important program. Now I don't want to talk about what the market potential is because you have to talk about pricing and I don't think we are ready to do that yet, given the early stage of development. But clearly, what this allows us to have is a Nektar wholly-owned combination. So it means that we have NKTR-214 and NKTR-262, of course, I said 262 and 214, because 262 theoretically comes first in the cascade. So with that wholly-owned combination, maybe there is no need for a checkpoint inhibitor with that combination. So we have to see how that plays out. We have to see how that evolves. And depending on the efficacy that we see from that and how valuable that combination is, it'll create a market for itself. With regard to the safety profile, I'll let Mary go into some detail. But I think, it's very important to note, no one has dropped off of NKTR-214 studies because of safety issues. Not a single patient has stopped therapy because of safety. That's an important distinction. Please follow through, Mary."

The most common symptoms that we see are flu-like symptoms tend to occur in the first cycle. And as patients are treated with subsequent cycle, patients really become more polarized and -- to the cytokine and do not have flu-like symptoms as they progress through treatment. The physicians really appreciate this because it is easy to manage the patients. About 24 to 48 hours after dosing, patients can expect to have fever and they take Tylenol or NSAID and it's resolved very quickly in a couple of days. And the predictability of the side effect profile is very much appreciated by both the physicians and patients alike. Again, we don't have discontinuations. Discontinuation rate is as high as 20% in these clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors. And so we are very pleased that patients can tolerate treatment, as Howard said."

On today's call, we will review our achievements is the beginning of this year for Nektar's pipeline and our planned milestones for the next 12 months, including our submission of an NDA for NKTR-181, which will occur this month and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214 entering Phase III trials and NKTR-262 now being evaluated in the recently initiated REVEAL study as well as our progress with our immunology program, NKTR-358. 
We will also update our financial guidance for 2018, incorporating the upfront payments we received in the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, which recently closed. 
Already this year-to-date, we have achieved multiple successes with our pipeline of Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. 
In the area of chronic pain, we will submit the NDA for NKTR-181 to the FDA this month. I'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of the team here at Nektar, as they've done a tremendous job over the last several months with both our FDA interactions and the preparation of the NDA incorporating FDA guidance. 
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harnessed the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Our new BMS collaboration, which became effective in April provides a platform for us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, broadly and rapidly with over 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types. We believe this will also allow us to achieve our goal of establishing NKTR-214 as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications. I'll talk more about this progress of this program in a moment. 
And in immunology, as you saw, we announced this week, we have now advance NKTR-358 into patients with the initiation of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in lupus patients. 
So 2018 is off to a great start and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy. So first, let's review NKTR-181. As you know, our highly productive interactions and pre-NDA meetings with the agency led to assembly of our NDA package, which includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients in healthy subjects. As I said earlier, we will submit the NDA this month. 
We incorporated the clear and collaborative guidance given to us by the FDA into our NDA submission. We believe that NKTR-181 is emerging at the right time to offer patients suffering from chronic pain an accessible and important potential new therapy, while also helping to address the current opioid public health emergency. Our mission with NKTR-181 from its invention was to provide pain relief to patients without the higher risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs. 
As the first new full new opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the rug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medicines for abuse. 
NKTR-181 is also only important therapy for patients but is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction in our country. We remain highly focused on finding the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval. 
The close of NKTR-181 significant potential and the current financial strength of our company, our focus is to -- is no longer on near term economics for NKTR-181, but rather to retain as much back end value as possible. As such, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181. One of which is to establish a separate majority-owned subsidiary with one or more partners to launch this important molecule. 
This approach is consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts in resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while maximizing the value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders. 
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have already begun planning the most important next steps in the joint clinical development program for NKTR-214. The intent of the broad clinical development program is to advance this potential combination regimen in I-O to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. 
To that end, we are extremely pleased that we are planning to start our first Phase III trials for NKTR-214 with Opdivo in the third quarter of this year. The first 2 trials will be in first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma and we plan to share the preliminary trial design at this year's ASCO meeting. 
Beyond renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, one of our top priorities is in the second half of 2018 will also be to design and launch our first registrational trials in lung cancer. BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged approach for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in lung cancer, which envisions multiple registrational trials in different patient populations. 
Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar are planning over 20 registrational-enabling trials that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types. We were extremely pleased that the abstract from the PIVOT trial was accepted for [Audio Gap] ongoing trial, the acceptance of an abstract is more difficult. And so we were delighted that the committee chose our abstract for an oral presentation. The abstract includes preliminary data from both escalation and expansion stages of PIVOT based on the database cut from early February. As this is an ongoing study, we plan to present our updated and new data at the meeting, which is consistent with how we presented ongoing data in the past, including at last year's presentation. 
We will also host a webcast IR event on Saturday evening following the oral presentation, which will include an expanded discussion of the preliminary updated data from PIVOT as well as a panel with 3 of our investigators. The panel will include lung oncologist Dr. Scott from Yale, melanoma specialist, Dr. Adi Diab from MD Anderson, who will present at the recession and Dr who is a renal cell and bladder cancer specialist also from MD Anderson. 
We look forward to seeing many of you in Chicago for this event. In addition to our notable oral presentation, there are number of other preclinical presentations for Nektar 214 with additional mechanisms of action beyond checkpoint inhibition, which will also be showcased at ask on. This includes our first presentation of preclinical data for NKTR-214 with Takeda's compound TAK-659 in preclinical models of both liquid and solid tumors. 
As you know, we just initiated a new clinical collaboration with Takeda, which included as Phase I study evaluating the combination of NKTR-214 with TAK-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study will start in the second half of this year. We are extremely excited about the possibilities of evaluating NKTR-214 for the first time in a liquid tumor setting. I'll let Jonathan talk about the unique synergies of the combination.
[Audio Gap]
at ASCO. Following the signing of Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now at an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TLR7/8 agonist and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can simulate both cells and memory T cells. 
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The trial is enrolling up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line settings as well as refractory settings. 
The first stage of the trial is assessing the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. Following that, the second stage of the trial will have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. 
We expect to have initial early data from some of the first patients in the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. 
As we've stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. 
This week, we announced that we have now dosed our first patients in the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus, and Jonathan will discuss this more in a moment. This program continues to advance quickly and we expect initial data from the lupus study sometime in the second half of next year. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory indications.
With that and I'm going to turn the call over to Jonathan."

And then, I'll cover the trial of Nektar and Lilly just initiated with NKTR-358. 
As Howard stated earlier, NKTR-214 is a broad-based immune mechanism that we intend to establish as a keystone therapeutic in I-O. And in this capacity, there are many scientifically driven ways to combine NKTR-214 with other agents that have complementary and non-overlapping mechanisms in order to unlock the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. 
And in this regard, our approach is to go where the science leads us and think broadly to incorporate mechanisms, expanding beyond checkpoint inhibition. 
In March of this year, REVEAL clinical trial, which evaluates a combination of NKTR-214 with our polymer conjugated intertumoral TLR7/8 agonist NKTR-262. 
NKTR-262 was designed expressly to be used in combination with NKTR-214. As a TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262 targets the innate immune system. And when, combined with NKTR-214, which targets the adaptive immune system, this combination engages the same biological pathways that our immune sensitive to fight infections. Except in this case, we use infrequent injection of NKTR-262 into 1 or 2 tumor lesions to educate the immune system and NKTR-214 to expand and propagate the educated immune system response throughout the entire body to target all tumor lesions, even ones not injected with NKTR-262.  We call this of immune response and we routinely see this in preclinical tumor model using NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. 
At AACR last month, we presented preclinical data showing the efficacy of this combination in multiple tumor models. And in addition, we showed deep mechanism of action data demonstrating how the individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to control their maturational functions of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations and their modification of systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response. 
We are very excited that the REVEAL trial is underway and have designed the trial to include a robust biomarker program predicated on translation of the unique mechanism of action of this combination. 
In April of this year, we announced the new clinical collaboration with Takeda to evaluate a NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659 for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that is already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
In preclinical tumor models, TAK-659 has shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of inflammatory in the tumor micro environment. Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to attack 659. 
At ASCO, next month, we will present our first preclinical data evaluating this combination in multiple tumor lines modeling both liquid and solid tumors. We are very excited to advance NKTR-214 into the liquid tumor setting. And our first clinical study will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 plus TAK-659 in Hodgkins and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the trial will begin later this year. 
Additionally, we are contacting preclinical research in tumor models evaluating doublet combinations of NKTR-214 with path inhibitor and with that or the or DPP inhibitor as well as an tumor models with neoantigen based vaccines in order to explore a patient's specific personalized cancer vaccine strategy. 
In all cases, we believed to have a strong scientific rationale for the cooperation that is both specific to the individual cooperation partners and that tumor selection for the intended use of each operation. The emerging data are very encouraging and some of it as Howard mentioned, will also be presented at ASCO next month. 
And as we move forward with the development program for NKTR-214, we will prioritize which of these mechanisms we could advance into the clinic. And I'd like to now expand on how discussion of NKTR-358 and review the clinical trial we just started with lupus patients. 
As Howard said, NKTR-358 is a notable program for Nektar as it has great potential in a number of autoimmune disease It provides further evidence of our ability to optimize biology and our core chemistry to control interactions to create potential new regular medicines. This expertise is now well recognized by a large pharmaceutical partners such as Bristol and Takeda for NKTR-214, and of course, with Lilly for NKTR-358. 
Our collaboration with Lilly is now focused on the comprehensive development of NKTR-358. As you know, Nektar is responsible for all activities up to the end of Phase I. And then, Lilly will take the lead from Phase II onwards. We observe promising biomarker results in our ongoing Phase Ia study of NKTR-358, which is a single ascending dose escalation trial in healthy volunteers. This trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and mechanism based immunological biomarkers associated with the pharmacodynamics of NKTR-358. We have now those escalated several times and the trial is progressing very well. So far today, we have observed dose-dependent increases in the right levels with no increases in conventional materials And in fact, as Howard stated, the result in healthy volunteers track very well with the preclinical studies we conducted in monkeys. And earlier this week, we dosed the first patients in the Phase Ib trial with NKTR-358, which is a multiple ascending dose escalation study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus also known as lupus. 
In this study, our objective is to safety, pharmacodynamics, changes in disease specific biomarkers and any clinical signs of activity in patients treated with repeat dose administration of NKTR-358. The markers will include evaluation of conventional cells, the Th17 to ratios, B cells and memory B cell levels and cells as well as a disease specific serum biomarkers, including anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies that complement. We will measure critical response using the SLE disease activity index. This study will inform the dose levels and design of the Phase II studies that our partner Lilly will run in several different autoimmune diseases indications. 
And with that, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's first quarter 2018 financial results and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance. 
We ended the first quarter of 2018 with $333.8 million of cash and investments, which does not include the payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb for the strategic collaboration transaction that closed on April 3, 2018. 
At the closing, we received $1.85 billion from BMS comprised of $1 billion up front payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.25 billion. For the first quarter, our revenue and expense line items were consistent with the annual guidance we gave on our year-end call. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains largely unchanged. We have completed the revenue recognition analysis and our independent auditors are in the process of completing their audit procedures for the BMS collaboration payments that will be accounted for in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018. 
We now expect to recognize substantially all of the $1 billion up front payment as revenue in the second quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.1 billion. Our full year revenue guidance outside of the payments from the BMS collaboration is unchanged at $100 million to $110 million, and we expect the remaining revenue to be recognized ratably over the remaining quarters of 2018. 
We continue to project 2018 GAAP R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We now anticipate G&A expense for 2018 to be between $70 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million to $32 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

First, I want to share with everybody that we were very honored to be selected as an oral presentation at ASCO. This year, there are over 6,400 abstracts submitted. So selection for podium time in ASCO is truly a distinction. And we shared we will have at least 100 patients who are I-O naïve that we're going to be presenting at ASCO. And given the clinical safety and efficacy data that we presented at and of course, the investigators that were already enrolling to the trial, accrual well to the renal cell carcinoma and melanoma cohorts or code more briskly. So therefore, at ASCO, we'll have the largest proportion of data for patients who have both first-line melanoma and first-line RCC and are stage IV disease. 
We're also going to have a handful of data for patients in lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as those investigators came on after our GU and melanoma oncologists will have fewer patients in those populations. I also want to let you know that the abstract will be available next week and the data cut for our abstract was in early February, although we will be providing a more current update with data plans to be presented at ASCO. 
So the other thing that's very important to understand, Chris, is that when we present the PIVOT-02 data at ASCO, they're going to be a number of patients who have only had 1 post-treatment scan. And as you know, in our dose escalation data set, we see patients having a deepening of response over time and an increase in the number of patients who respond as they stay on treatment. And of course, we've shared many times, the patients are able to tolerate treatment and continue on the doublet because the treatment regimen is very well-tolerated. So we'll clearly point out to you though studies -- the patients will be announced at a longer and those patients who have had 1 scan and more than 1 scan.

I think, look, all of management stock sales have been done under plans that were put in place sometime some time ago. And for the most part, the sales of shares that you see our just a small percentage of the ownership of the management team, and quite frankly, are generally within a year of expiration. 
Now I think if you look at -- I always look at this myself because I think it's a very important question to ask and I certainly know the investors are looking at this carefully. But if you look at the ownership and shares of the senior management team at Nektar, they probably still on 80% of their vested shares and they haven't been selling those. So if you come upon shares that are expiring or soon to expire,  of course, they are going to be disposed off in some fashion. But I always look to myself and I look at the entire team and I say, where do we stand as a management team in owning a portion of Nektar. And for example, I still have probably 80% of my vested shares are still sitting in the bank, so to speak, right. So I don't think there's been any unusual stock sales. I think the management is going to dispose of shares as they come close to expiration as stock options come close to expirations. But I also know that the team is well staked with vested shares and has a strong belief that this company has enormous potential and a long way to go. And I don't see anybody disposing of shares that aren't reasonably close to expiration, I should say, options are reasonably close to expiration. 
So I hope everybody understands that in some fashion, stock options are a form of compensation and it's not unusual to see that form of compensation taking advantage of by management, especially after such a successful performance in 2017, and so far in 2018. And quite frankly, while I'm always looking at this, I don't have a problem with people leaking bit of money off the table when shares are in the neighborhood of expiring, when options are the neighborhood of expiring. I hope that answers the question?"

And so, we will be presenting some of those data as well as at ASCO, which will show why we bridged our Phase II into our Phase III for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. And certainly, we are very eager to move forward in a very broad clinical development program. As Howard mentioned to you, we have over 20 registration of studies that we're launching within the next 14 months. And we have shown and shared with you efficacy data already for multiple different tumor types at various stages of development. And to answer to your second question about the accelerated approval pathways, we do have strategies embedded into our protocol and we are moving forward with accelerated approval pathways in the relapsed and refractory populations for non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. We do believe that this is an opportunity to rapidly and potentially have NKTR-214 on the market."

From that, we actually developed a number of models to allow us to translate dose administration and make predictions on how to scale and plan to do the dosing using the animal model as a guide. So certainly the first dose level that we selected as well as the strategy and approach for the new guided injections, those all came from information learned from the animal studies. And then, in regards to the second part of your question, so we administered NKTR-262 in the protocol. It's infrequent we necessarily need to repeatedly inject the tumors. So the way that we would be using that doublet or triplett is we would introduce inter-tumoral NKTR-262. But then systemically, we would give either NKTR-214 alone in the case of doublet or NKTR-214 plus nivolumab in the case of triplett. And then the patients would stay on the systemic therapy and we would only readminister NKTR-262 if necessary upon restaging the patient."

And it goes back to what I've said all along and I know JZ said all along, which is a molecule that can close the proliferation of effector T cells is the centerpiece of I-O. Without T cells, without T cells, I-O therapy starts to fall apart. So because what I believe is that we have the centerpiece of an I-O therapy and we also have other pieces such as NKTR-262, I don't think we're dependent on checkpoint inhibition as a strategy. I think NKTR-214 carries its own strategy. And we're going to look at it with checkpoint modalities, but we'll also be looking at it with methods of creating antigens such as NKTR-262, potentially new antigen vaccines and potentially even chemotherapy approaches. So there is a number of different things you can do with NKTR-214 in a very broad way in immuno-oncology. And if you believe it's at the center of that circle, which we think it is, then think of all the possibilities and all the different things you can do, even combinations with car T therapies, which have proven enormously important given their very short duration of effect. So I think we do have a strategy. We haven't mapped it out publicly yet. We're discussing possibilities with numerous companies. You can see what we just did with Takeda small molecules. There is a lot of companies that want to work with NKTR-214. You know outside of the BMS collaboration, we're allowed to work with it in all these different approaches.

So TAK-659, it is a kinase inhibitor, but it's a very selective kinase inhibitor that has dual activity on the animal and that's again which is kinase. And also, the which is a response to the And so, there are 2 really unique features of this particular TKI besides that selectivity. And the first is with SYK, you engage the immunoreceptor tyrosine So these are the kind of that you see in a lot of immune cells. And SYK is the key enzyme that controls the downstream signaling of those complexes and controls signaling into the downstream and others. And we find that can control signaling in a range of different cell types, not just in B cells, where we typically think of SYK, but also in monocytes and myeloid cells even in high granular cells that rely on it for signaling. And we also noted that the case with FLT as well as that highly representative along the compartment. So unique is that a lot of clinical studies, Takeda scientist discovered that a lot of the suppressive cell populations that have myeloid that are of the myeloid subset, tumor are highly kind of almost addicted to these And then, when you treat these kind of tumors, the cell populations themselves vanish or they dedifferentiate. And in particularly, what was a very exciting was changing the creating a very large increase in the subset. 
So why this combination is so interesting to combine with NKTR-214 is it really a target cell populations and cellular processes that NKTR-214 does not directly engage. And so, that's why this doublet is very interesting. And I hope you have a chance to see the presentation at ASCO, because the preclinical data of these 2 agents as a doublet is very, very compelling when we see some very, very strong preclinical results. We are seeing those results pretty quickly that lead us into this advanced moving into this clinical collaboration with the first trial starting later this year."

But in general, what you need to prove is that you can, with your 95% confidence interval for your objective response rate that you are lower down of that 95% confidence interval rules out the point estimate for standard of care. So just to give you like a especially example in terms of relapsed and refractory melanoma population, where those patients have been treated with a prior checkpoint inhibitor, a second line treatment could be which has about a 30% objective response rate. So you would want to see an objective response rate somewhere around 20% or above 20% where you are 95% confidence interval, the lower would be above 13%. In terms of non-small-cell lung cancer, post-I-O, plus chemo or post-I-O is a very reasonable in the second line setting. And there is been a number of large Phase III trials that show that the objective response rate for those is roughly 9%. And so, in the non-small-cell lung cancer population that has been previously treated with an I/O agent, the doublet of NKTR-214 plus we have estimated have to have an objective response rate around 18% or higher to rollout the lower down off the 95% confidence interval that's above 9%. Just to give you some ideas. When we do our statistical calculations, those cohorts need to be around 100 patients to be able to demonstrate that level of efficacy. I hope that helps."

On today's call, we will review our achievements since the beginning of this year for Nektar's pipeline and our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including our submission of an NDA for NKTR-181, which will occur this month and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214 entering Phase III trials and NKTR-262 now being evaluated in the recently initiated REVEAL study as well as our progress with our immunology program, NKTR-358.
We will also update our financial guidance for 2018, incorporating the upfront payments we received in the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, which recently closed. 
Already this year-to-date, we have achieved multiple successes with our pipeline of Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: Immuno-oncology, immunology and pain.
In the area of chronic pain, we will submit the NDA for NKTR-181 to the FDA this month. I'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of the team here at Nektar, as they've done a tremendous job over the last several months with both our FDA interactions and the preparation of the NDA incorporating FDA guidance.
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer.
Our new BMS collaboration, which became effective in April, provides a platform of us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, broadly and rapidly with over 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types. We believe this will also allow us to achieve our goal of establishing NKTR-214 as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications. I'll talk more about this progress of this program in a moment.
And in immunology, as you saw, we announced this week, we have now advance NKTR-358 into patients with the initiation of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in lupus patients.
So 2018 is off to a great start, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy.
So first, let's review NKTR-181. As you know, our highly productive interactions and pre-NDA meetings with the agency led to assembly of our NDA package, which includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. As I said earlier, we will submit the NDA this month. We incorporated the clear and collaborative guidance given to us by the FDA into our NDA submission. We believe that NKTR-181 is emerging at the right time to offer patients suffering from chronic pain an accessible and important potential new therapy, while also helping to address the current opioid public health emergency. Our mission with NKTR-181 from its invention was to provide pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs.
As the first new full mu-opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medicines for abuse.
NKTR-181 is not only an important therapy for patients, but is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction in our country. We remain highly focused on finding the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval.
Because of NKTR-181's significant potential and the current financial strength of our company, our focus is to no -- is no longer on near term economics for NKTR-181, but rather to retain as much back-end value as possible. As such, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181, one of which is to establish a separate majority-owned subsidiary with one or more partners to launch this important molecule. This approach is consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while maximizing the value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have already begun planning the most important next steps in the joint clinical development program for NKTR-214. The intent of the broad clinical development program is to advance this potential combination regimen in I-O to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. To that end, we are extremely pleased that we are planning to start our first Phase III trials for NKTR-214 with Opdivo in the third quarter of this year. The first 2 trials will be in first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma, and we plan to share the preliminary trial designs at this year's ASCO meeting.
Beyond renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, one of our top priorities is this -- in the second half of 2018, will also be to design and launch our first registrational trials in lung cancer. BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged approach for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in lung cancer, which envisions multiple registrational trials in different patient populations. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar are planning over 20 registrational-enabling trials that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types.
We were extremely pleased that the abstract from the PIVOT trial was accepted for oral presentation during the Developmental Therapeutics Immunotherapy session at ASCO. As you know, with an ongoing trial, the acceptance of an abstract is more difficult. And so we were delighted that the committee chose our abstract for an oral presentation. The abstract includes preliminary data from both escalation and expansion stages of PIVOT based on the database cut from early February. As this is an ongoing study, we plan to present our updated and new data at the meeting, which is consistent with how we presented ongoing data in the past, including at last year's Citi presentation. We will also host a webcast IR event on Saturday evening, following the oral presentation, which will include an expanded discussion of the preliminary updated data from PIVOT as well as a panel with 3 of our investigators. The panel will include: Lung oncologist, Dr. Scott Gettinger from Yale; melanoma specialist, Dr. Adi Diab from MD Anderson, who will present at the oral session; and Dr. Nizar Tannir, who is a renal cell and bladder cancer specialist, also from MD Anderson. We look forward to seeing many of you in Chicago for this event.
In addition to our notable oral presentation, there are a number of other preclinical presentations for NKTR-214 with additional mechanisms of action beyond checkpoint inhibition, which will also be showcased at ASCO. This includes our first presentation of preclinical data for NKTR-214 with Takeda's compound TAK-659 in preclinical models of both liquid and solid tumors.
As you know, we just initiated a new clinical collaboration with Takeda, which includes a Phase I study evaluating the combination of NKTR-214 with TAK-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study will start in the second half of this year. We're extremely excited about the possibilities of evaluating NKTR-214 for the first time in a liquid tumor setting. I'll let Jonathan talk about the unique synergies of the combination of these two I-O mechanisms in a moment as well as other preclinical presentations planned for ASCO.
Following the signing of Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes: NKTR-262, a TLR7/8 agonist; and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can simulate both NK cells and memory T cells.
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The trial is enrolling up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line settings as well as refractory settings. The first stage of the trial is assessing the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. Following that, the second stage of the trial will have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have initial early data from some of the first patients in the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans.
This week, we announced that we have now dosed our first patients in the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus, and Jonathan will discuss this more in a moment. This program continues to advance quickly, and we expect initial data from the lupus study sometime in the second half of next year. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory indications.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jonathan."

I'll spend some time talking about the science behind combining NKTR-214 with other mechanisms beyond checkpoint inhibition and why we are so excited about this. And then, I'll cover the trial that Nektar and Lilly just initiated with NKTR-358.
As Howard stated earlier, NKTR-214 is a broad-based immune mechanism that we intend to establish as a keystone therapeutic in I-O. And in this capacity, there are many scientifically driven ways to combine NKTR-214 with other agents that have complementary and non-overlapping mechanisms in order to unlock the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. And in this regard, our approach is to go where the science leads us and think broadly to incorporate combinatorial mechanisms, expanding beyond checkpoint inhibition.
In March of this year, we began the REVEAL clinical trial, which evaluates the combination of NKTR-214 with our polymer conjugated intratumoral TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262.
NKTR-262 was designed expressly to be used in combination with NKTR-214. As a TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262 targets the innate immune system, and when combined with NKTR-214, which targets the adaptive immune system, this combination engages the same biological pathways that our immune system uses to fight infections, except in this case we use infrequent injection of NKTR-262 into 1 or 2 tumor lesions to educate the immune system, and NKTR-214 to expand and propagate the educated immune system response throughout the entire body to target all tumor lesions, even ones not injected with NKTR-262. We call this an abscopal immune response, and we routinely see this in preclinical tumor models using NKTR-262 and NKTR-214.
At AACR last month, we presented preclinical data showing the efficacy of this combination in multiple mouse and genetic tumor models. And in addition, we showed deep mechanism of action data demonstrating how the individual agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations and their modification of systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response.
We are very excited that the REVEAL trial is underway, and have designed the trial to include a robust biomarker program predicated on the translation of a unique mechanism of action of this combination.
In April of this year, we announced a new clinical collaboration with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659 for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 has shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of proinflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to tag 659.
At ASCO, next month, we will present our first preclinical data evaluating this combination in multiple mouse tumor lines, modeling both liquid and solid tumors. We are very excited to advance NKTR-214 into the liquid tumor setting, and our first clinical study will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 plus TAK-659 in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the trial will begin later this year.
Additionally, we are conducting preclinical research in the syngeneic mouse tumor models evaluating doublet combinations of NKTR-214 with a PARP inhibitor and with a dipeptidyl peptidase, or DPP, a FAB inhibitor as well as in tumor models with neoantigen-based vaccines in order to explore a patient's specific personalized cancer vaccine strategy.
In all cases, we believe to have a strong scientific rationale for the combination that is both specific to the individual combination partners and the tumor selection for the intended use of each combination. The emerging data are very encouraging and some of this, as Howard mentioned, will also be presented at ASCO next month. And as we move forward with the development program for NKTR-214, we will prioritize which of these mechanisms we could advance into the clinic.
And I'd like to now expand on Howard's discussion of NKTR-358 and review the clinical trial we just started in lupus patients. As Howard said, NKTR-358 is a notable program for Nektar as it has great potential in a number of autoimmune disease states. It provides further evidence of our ability to optimize cytokine biology and use our core chemistry to control ligand receptor interactions to create potential new breakthrough medicines. This expertise is now well recognized by our large pharmaceutical partners, such as Bristol and Takeda, for NKTR-214 and, of course, with Lilly for NKTR-358.
Our collaboration with Lilly is now focused on the comprehensive development of NKTR-358. As you know, Nektar is responsible for all activities up to the end of Phase I, and then Lilly will take the lead from Phase II onwards. We've observed promising biomarker results in our ongoing Phase Ia study of NKTR-358, which is a single ascending dose-escalation trial in healthy volunteers. This trial evaluated safety, tolerability and mechanism-based immunological biomarkers associated with the pharmacodynamics of NKTR-358. We have now dose escalated several times and the trial is progressing very well. So far to date, we have observed dose-dependent increases in Treg levels, with no increases in conventional T cells or NK cells. And in fact, as Howard stated, the results in healthy volunteers track very well with the preclinical studies we conducted in monkeys.
And earlier this week, we dosed the first patients in the Phase Ib trial with NKTR-358, which is a multiple ascending dose-escalation study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, changes in disease-specific biomarkers and any clinical signs of activity in patients treated with repeat dose administrations of NKTR-358. The PD markers will include evaluation of Tregs, T conventional cells, the Th17 to Treg ratios, B cells and memory B cell levels, NK cells as well as disease-specific serum biomarkers, including anti-double stranded DNA antibodies and complement. We will measure clinical response using the SLE disease activity index. This study will inform the dose levels and design the Phase II studies that our partner Lilly will run in several different autoimmune diseases indications.
And with that, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's first quarter 2018 financial results, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance.
We ended the first quarter of 2018 with $333.8 million of cash and investments, which does not include the payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb for the strategic collaboration transaction that closed on April 3, 2018.
At the closing, we received $1.85 billion from BMS comprised of $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. For the first quarter, our revenue and expense line items were consistent with the annual guidance we gave on our year-end call.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains largely unchanged. We have completed the revenue recognition analysis and our independent auditors are in the process of completing their audit procedures for the BMS collaboration payments that will be accounted for in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018.
We now expect to recognize substantially all of the $1 billion upfront payment as revenue in the second quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.1 billion. Our full year revenue guidance outside of the payments from the BMS collaboration is unchanged at $100 million to $110 million, and we expect the remaining revenue to be recognized ratably over the remaining quarters of 2018.
We continue to project 2018 GAAP R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We now anticipate G&A expense for 2018 to be between $70 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million to $32 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

Well, first, I want to share with everybody that we were very honored to be selected as an oral presentation at ASCO. This year, there were over 6,400 abstracts submitted. So selection for podium time at ASCO is truly a distinction. And we shared we will have at least 100 patients who are I-O naïve that we're going to be presenting at ASCO. And given the clinical safety and efficacy data that we presented at Citi and, of course, the investigators that were already enrolling to the trial, accrual to the renal cell carcinoma and melanoma cohorts occurred more briskly. So therefore, at ASCO, we'll have the largest proportion of data for patients who have both first-line melanoma and first-line RCC and are stage IV disease. We're also going to have a handful of data for patients in lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as those investigators came on after our GU and melanoma oncologists, we'll have fewer patients in those populations. I also want to let you know that the abstract will be available next week and the data cut for our abstract was in early February, although we will be providing a more current update with data plans to be presented at ASCO. So the other thing that's very important to understand, Chris, is that when we present the PIVOT-02 data at ASCO, they're going to be a number of patients who have only had one post-treatment scan. And as you know, in our dose escalation data set, we see patients having a deepening of response over time and an increase in the number of patients who respond as they stay on treatment. And of course, we've shared many times that patients are able to tolerate treatment and continue on the doublet because the treatment regimen is very well tolerated. So we'll clearly point out to you the studies -- the patients who have been on study longer and those patients who have had one scan and more than one scan.

Remember, again, I have to emphasize that I -- what I just told Chris, but I want to tell you, too, Jessica, most of these patients are going to be on study with one scan. And so we do -- again, I want to emphasize that we see our efficacy data mature over time, and so we will have to provide you with the information about those patients who have been on study longer and those patients who have only had one scan. Likewise, we will provide an update for those patients who were enrolled to the dose escalation, and we'll let you know how the patient with the complete response and the 2 patients that we previously reported to you that had partial response that were treated in the second-line non-small cell lung cancer setting."

I think, look, you -- all the management stock sales have been done under plans that were put in place some time ago. And for the most part, the sales of shares that you see are just a small percentage of the ownership of the management team and, quite frankly, are generally within a year of expiration. Now I think if you look at -- I always look at this myself because I think it's a very important question to ask, and I certainly know the investors are looking at this carefully, but if you look at the ownership and shares of the senior management team at Nektar, they probably still own 80% of their vested shares and they haven't been selling those. So if you come upon shares that are expiring or soon to expire, of course, they're going to be disposed off in some fashion. But if -- but I always look at the -- I look to myself and I look at the entire team and I say, where do we stand as a management team in owning a portion of Nektar. And for example, I still have -- probably 80% of my vested shares are still sitting in the bank, so to speak, right? So I don't think there's been any unusual stock sales. I think the management is going to dispose off shares as they come close to expiration as stock options come close to expirations. But I also know that the team is well staked with vested shares and has a strong belief that this company has enormous potential and a long way to go. And I don't see anybody disposing off shares that aren't reasonably close to expiration. So -- or I should say, options reasonably close to expiration. So I hope everybody understands that in some fashion, stock options are a form of compensation and it's not unusual to see that form of compensation taken advantage of by management, especially after such a successful performance in 2017 and so far in 2018. And quite frankly, while I'm always looking at this, I don't have a problem with people taking little bit of money off the table when shares are in the neighborhood of expiring, when options are in the neighborhood of expiring. I hope that answers the question."

And then in regards to the second part of your question, so we administered NKTR-262 in the protocol. It's infrequent.
[Audio Gap] 
so we necessarily need to repeatedly inject the tumors. So the way that we would be using that doublet or triplet is we would introduce intratumoral NKTR-262. But then systemically, we would give either NKTR-214 alone in the case of a doublet or NKTR-214 plus nivolumab in the case of the triplet. And then the patients would stay on the systemic therapy, and we would only readminister NKTR-262 if necessary upon restaging the patient."

And clearly, there's a strategy behind this, and it goes back to what I've said all along and I know JZ has said all along, which is a molecule that can cause the proliferation of effector T cells is the centerpiece of I-O. Without T cells, without effector T cells, I-O therapy starts to fall apart. So because what I believe is that we have the centerpiece of an I-O therapy and we also have other pieces, such as NKTR-262, I don't think we're dependent on checkpoint inhibition as a strategy. I think NKTR-214 carries its own strategy, and we're going to look at it with checkpoint modalities, but we'll also be looking at it with methods of creating antigens, such as NKTR-262, potentially neoantigen vaccines and potentially even chemotherapy approaches. So there's a number of different things you can do with NKTR-214 in a very broad way in immuno-oncology. And if you believe it's that center of that circle, which we think it is, then think of all the possibilities and all the different things you can do, even combinations with CAR-T therapies, which have proven enormously important, given their very short duration of effect. So I think we do have a strategy. We haven't mapped it out publicly yet. We're discussing possibilities with numerous companies. You can see what we just did with Takeda's small molecule. There is a lot of companies that want to work with NKTR-214. You know outside of the BMS collaboration, we're allowed to work with it in all these different approaches.

Thanks, Mary, and thanks, Arlinda. So you know you highlighted a very interesting point. So TAK-659, it is a kinase inhibitor, but it's a very selective kinase inhibitor that has dual activity on the lone animal, and that's again SYK, which is spleen tyrosine kinase, and also the FLT-3, which is the signals in response to the FLT-3 ligand. And so there are 2 really unique features of this particular TKI besides the selectivity. And the first is that with SYK, you engage the immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling. So these are the kind of ICAMs that you see in a lot of immune cells. And SYK is the key enzyme that controls the downstream signaling of those complexes and controls signaling to the downstream machinery such as phospholipase gamma and others. And we find that ICAMs can control signaling in a range of different cell types, not just in B cells, where we typically think of SYK, but also in monocytes and myeloid cells, even in high granular cells that rely on it for signaling. And we also noted that's the case with FLT as well is that's highly representative along the myeloid compartment. And so what is very unique is that in a lot of preclinical studies, Takeda scientists discovered that a lot of the suppressive cell populations that have myeloid -- that are of the myeloid subset, I mean, in the tumor microenvironment are highly kind of almost addicted to these pathways. And then when you treat these kind of tumors, the cell populations themselves vanish or they dedifferentiate. And in particularly, what was very exciting was changing the plasticity of M1 macrophage phenotype creating a very large increase in the proinflammatory macrophage subset. So why this combination is so interesting to combine with NKTR-214 is that it really targets cell populations and cellular processes that NKTR-214 does not directly engage. And so that's why this doublet is very interesting. And I hope you have a chance to see the presentation at ASCO because the preclinical data with these 2 agents as a doublet is very, very compelling when we see some very, very strong preclinical results. And we're seeing those results pretty quickly that lead us into this advanced -- moving into this clinical collaboration with the first trial starting later this year."

And as you can imagine, partnering with BMS, we're able to leverage a lot of experience that they've had with the FDA on these topics. But in general, what you need to prove is that you can, with your 95% confidence interval for your objective response rate, that your lower bound of that 95% confidence interval rules out the point estimate for standard of care. So just to give you, like a specific example in terms of relapsed/refractory melanoma population, where those patients have been treated with a prior checkpoint inhibitor, a second-line treatment could be ipilimumab, which has about 13% objective response rate. So you would want to see an objective response rate somewhere around 20% or above 20%, where your 95% confidence interval, the lower bound would be above 13%. In terms of non-small cell lung cancer, post-I-O plus chemo or post-I-O, docetaxel is a very reasonable comparator in the second-line setting. And there's been a number of large Phase III trials that show that the objective response rate for docetaxel is roughly 9%. And so in the non-small cell lung cancer population that has been previously treated with an I/O agent, the doublet of NKTR-214 plus nivo, we had estimated has to have an objective response rate around 18% or higher to rule out the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval that's above 9%. Just to give you some ideas, when we do our statistical calculations, those cohorts need to be around 100 patients to be able to demonstrate that level of efficacy. I hope that helps."

On today's call, we will review our achievements since the beginning of this year for Nektar's pipeline and our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including our submission of an NDA for NKTR-181, which will occur this month and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214 entering Phase III trials and NKTR-262 now being evaluated in the recently initiated REVEAL study as well as our progress with our immunology program, NKTR-358.
We will also update our financial guidance for 2018, incorporating the upfront payments we received in the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, which recently closed. 
Already this year-to-date, we have achieved multiple successes with our pipeline of Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: Immuno-oncology, immunology and pain.
In the area of chronic pain, we will submit the NDA for NKTR-181 to the FDA this month. I'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of the team here at Nektar, as they've done a tremendous job over the last several months with both our FDA interactions and the preparation of the NDA incorporating FDA guidance.
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer.
Our new BMS collaboration, which became effective in April, provides a platform of us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, broadly and rapidly with over 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types. We believe this will also allow us to achieve our goal of establishing NKTR-214 as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications. I'll talk more about this progress of this program in a moment.
And in immunology, as you saw, we announced this week, we have now advance NKTR-358 into patients with the initiation of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in lupus patients.
So 2018 is off to a great start, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy.
So first, let's review NKTR-181. As you know, our highly productive interactions and pre-NDA meetings with the agency led to assembly of our NDA package, which includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. As I said earlier, we will submit the NDA this month. We incorporated the clear and collaborative guidance given to us by the FDA into our NDA submission. We believe that NKTR-181 is emerging at the right time to offer patients suffering from chronic pain an accessible and important potential new therapy, while also helping to address the current opioid public health emergency. Our mission with NKTR-181 from its invention was to provide pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs.
As the first new full mu-opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medicines for abuse.
NKTR-181 is not only an important therapy for patients, but is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction in our country. We remain highly focused on finding the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval.
Because of NKTR-181's significant potential and the current financial strength of our company, our focus is to no -- is no longer on near term economics for NKTR-181, but rather to retain as much back-end value as possible. As such, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181, one of which is to establish a separate majority-owned subsidiary with one or more partners to launch this important molecule. This approach is consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while maximizing the value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have already begun planning the most important next steps in the joint clinical development program for NKTR-214. The intent of the broad clinical development program is to advance this potential combination regimen in I-O to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. To that end, we are extremely pleased that we are planning to start our first Phase III trials for NKTR-214 with Opdivo in the third quarter of this year. The first 2 trials will be in first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma, and we plan to share the preliminary trial designs at this year's ASCO meeting.
Beyond renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, one of our top priorities is this -- in the second half of 2018, will also be to design and launch our first registrational trials in lung cancer. BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged approach for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in lung cancer, which envisions multiple registrational trials in different patient populations. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar are planning over 20 registrational-enabling trials that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types.
We were extremely pleased that the abstract from the PIVOT trial was accepted for oral presentation during the Developmental Therapeutics Immunotherapy session at ASCO. As you know, with an ongoing trial, the acceptance of an abstract is more difficult. And so we were delighted that the committee chose our abstract for an oral presentation. The abstract includes preliminary data from both escalation and expansion stages of PIVOT based on the database cut from early February. As this is an ongoing study, we plan to present our updated and new data at the meeting, which is consistent with how we presented ongoing data in the past, including at last year's Citi presentation. We will also host a webcast IR event on Saturday evening, following the oral presentation, which will include an expanded discussion of the preliminary updated data from PIVOT as well as a panel with 3 of our investigators. The panel will include: Lung oncologist, Dr. Scott Gettinger from Yale; melanoma specialist, Dr. Adi Diab from MD Anderson, who will present at the oral session; and Dr. Nizar Tannir, who is a renal cell and bladder cancer specialist, also from MD Anderson. We look forward to seeing many of you in Chicago for this event.
In addition to our notable oral presentation, there are a number of other preclinical presentations for NKTR-214 with additional mechanisms of action beyond checkpoint inhibition, which will also be showcased at ASCO. This includes our first presentation of preclinical data for NKTR-214 with Takeda's compound TAK-659 in preclinical models of both liquid and solid tumors.
As you know, we just initiated a new clinical collaboration with Takeda, which includes a Phase I study evaluating the combination of NKTR-214 with TAK-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study will start in the second half of this year. We're extremely excited about the possibilities of evaluating NKTR-214 for the first time in a liquid tumor setting. I'll let Jonathan talk about the unique synergies of the combination of these two I-O mechanisms in a moment as well as other preclinical presentations planned for ASCO.
Following the signing of Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes: NKTR-262, a TLR7/8 agonist; and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can simulate both NK cells and memory T cells.
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The trial is enrolling up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line settings as well as refractory settings. The first stage of the trial is assessing the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. Following that, the second stage of the trial will have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have initial early data from some of the first patients in the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans.
This week, we announced that we have now dosed our first patients in the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus, and Jonathan will discuss this more in a moment. This program continues to advance quickly, and we expect initial data from the lupus study sometime in the second half of next year. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory indications.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jonathan."

I'll spend some time talking about the science behind combining NKTR-214 with other mechanisms beyond checkpoint inhibition and why we are so excited about this. And then, I'll cover the trial that Nektar and Lilly just initiated with NKTR",1041,"Thanks, Howard. I'll spend some time talking about the science behind combining NKTR-214 with other mechanisms beyond checkpoint inhibition and why we are so excited about this. And then, I'll cover the trial that Nektar and Lilly just initiated with NKTR-358.
As Howard stated earlier, NKTR-214 is a broad-based immune mechanism that we intend to establish as a keystone therapeutic in I-O. And in this capacity, there are many scientifically driven ways to combine NKTR-214 with other agents that have complementary and non-overlapping mechanisms in order to unlock the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. And in this regard, our approach is to go where the science leads us and think broadly to incorporate combinatorial mechanisms, expanding beyond checkpoint inhibition.
In March of this year, we began the REVEAL clinical trial, which evaluates the combination of NKTR-214 with our polymer conjugated intra-tumoral TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262.
NKTR-262 was designed expressly to be used in combination with NKTR-214. As a TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262 targets the innate immune system, and when combined with NKTR-214, which targets the adaptive immune system, this combination engages the same biological pathways that our immune system uses to fight infections, except in this case we use infrequent injection of NKTR-262 into 1 or 2 tumor lesions to educate the immune system, and NKTR-214 to expand and propagate the educated immune system response throughout the entire body to target all tumor lesions, even ones not injected with NKTR-262. We call this an abscopal immune response, and we routinely see this in preclinical tumor models using NKTR-262 and NKTR-214.
At AACR last month, we presented preclinical data showing the efficacy of this combination in multiple mouse and genetic tumor models. And in addition, we showed deep mechanism of action data demonstrating how the individual agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations and their modification of systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response.
We are very excited that the REVEAL trial is underway, and have designed the trial to include a robust biomarker program predicated on the translation of a unique mechanism of action for this combination.
In April of this year, we announced a new clinical collaboration with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659 for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 has shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659.
At ASCO, next month, we will present our first preclinical data evaluating this combination in multiple mouse tumor lines, modeling both liquid and solid tumors. We are very excited to advance NKTR-214 into the liquid tumor setting, and our first clinical study will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 plus TAK-659 in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the trial will begin later this year.
Additionally, we are conducting preclinical research in the syngeneic mouse tumor models evaluating doublet combinations of NKTR-214 with a PARP inhibitor and with a dipeptidyl peptidase, or DPP, a FAB inhibitor as well as in tumor models with neoantigen-based vaccines in order to explore a patient's specific personalized cancer vaccine strategy.
In all cases, we believe to have a strong scientific rationale for the combination that is both specific to the individual combination partners and the tumor selection for the intended use of each combination. The emerging data are very encouraging and some of this, as Howard mentioned, will also be presented at ASCO next month. And as we move forward with the development program for NKTR-214, we will prioritize which of these mechanisms we could advance into the clinic.
And I'd like to now expand on Howard's discussion of NKTR-358 and review the clinical trial we just started in lupus patients. As Howard said, NKTR-358 is a notable program for Nektar as it has great potential in a number of autoimmune disease states. It provides further evidence of our ability to optimize cytokine biology and use our core chemistry to control ligand receptor interactions to create potential new breakthrough medicines. This expertise is now well recognized by our large pharmaceutical partners, such as Bristol and Takeda, for NKTR-214 and, of course, with Lilly for NKTR-358.
Our collaboration with Lilly is now focused on the comprehensive development of NKTR-358. As you know, Nektar is responsible for all activities up to the end of Phase I, and then Lilly will take the lead from Phase II onwards. We've observed promising biomarker results in our ongoing Phase Ia study of NKTR-358, which is a single ascending dose-escalation trial in healthy volunteers. This trial evaluated safety, tolerability and mechanism-based immunological biomarkers associated with the pharmacodynamics of NKTR-358. We have now dose escalated several times and the trial is progressing very well. So far to date, we have observed dose-dependent increases in Treg levels, with no increases in conventional T cells or NK cells. And in fact, as Howard stated, the results in healthy volunteers track very well with the preclinical studies we conducted in monkeys.
And earlier this week, we dosed the first patients in the Phase Ib trial with NKTR-358, which is a multiple ascending dose-escalation study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, changes in disease-specific biomarkers and any clinical signs of activity in patients treated with repeat dose administrations of NKTR-358. The PD markers will include evaluation of Tregs, T conventional cells, the Th17 to Treg ratios, B cells and memory B cell levels, NK cells as well as disease-specific serum biomarkers, including anti-double stranded DNA antibodies and complement. We will measure clinical response using the SLE disease activity index. This study will inform the dose levels and design the Phase II studies that our partner Lilly will run in several different autoimmune diseases indications.
And with that, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's first quarter 2018 financial results, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance.
We ended the first quarter of 2018 with $333.8 million of cash and investments, which does not include the payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb for the strategic collaboration transaction that closed on April 3, 2018.
At the closing, we received $1.85 billion from BMS comprised of $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. For the first quarter, our revenue and expense line items were consistent with the annual guidance we gave on our year-end call.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains largely unchanged. We have completed the revenue recognition analysis and our independent auditors are in the process of completing their audit procedures for the BMS collaboration payments that will be accounted for in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018.
We now expect to recognize substantially all of the $1 billion upfront payment as revenue in the second quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.1 billion. Our full year revenue guidance outside of the payments from the BMS collaboration is unchanged at $100 million to $110 million, and we expect the remaining revenue to be recognized ratably over the remaining quarters of 2018.
We continue to project 2018 GAAP R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We now anticipate G&A expense for 2018 to be between $70 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million to $32 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

Well, first, I want to share with everybody that we were very honored to be selected as an oral presentation at ASCO. This year, there were over 6,400 abstracts submitted. So selection for podium time at ASCO is truly a distinction. And we shared we will have at least 100 patients who are I-O naïve that we're going to be presenting at ASCO. And given the clinical safety and efficacy data that we presented at Citi and, of course, the investigators that were already enrolling to the trial, accrual to the renal cell carcinoma and melanoma cohorts occurred more briskly. So therefore, at ASCO, we'll have the largest proportion of data for patients who have both first-line melanoma and first-line RCC and are stage IV disease. We're also going to have a handful of data for patients in lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as those investigators came on after our GU and melanoma oncologists, we'll have fewer patients in those populations. I also want to let you know that the abstract will be available next week and the data cut for our abstract was in early February, although we will be providing a more current update with data plans to be presented at ASCO. So the other thing that's very important to understand, Chris, is that when we present the PIVOT-02 data at ASCO, they're going to be a number of patients who have only had one post-treatment scan. And as you know, in our dose escalation data sets, we see patients having a deepening of response over time and an increase in the number of patients who respond as they stay on treatment. And of course, we've shared many times that patients are able to tolerate treatment and continue on the doublet because the treatment regimen is very well tolerated. So we'll clearly point out to you the studies -- the patients who have been on study longer and those patients who have had one scan and more than one scan. And so I just want to say, we're really looking forward to seeing you and everyone on this call at our ASCO presentation, and that's going to take place on Saturday, June 2, in the Developmental Therapeutics session between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m."

I think, look, you -- all the management stock sales have been done under plans that were put in place some time ago. And for the most part, the sales of shares that you see are just a small percentage of the ownership of the management team and, quite frankly, are generally within a year of expiration. Now I think if you look at -- I always look at this myself because I think it's a very important question to ask, and I certainly know the investors are looking at this carefully, but if you look at the ownership and shares of the senior management team at Nektar, they probably still own 80% of their vested shares and they haven't been selling those. So if you come upon shares that are expiring or soon to expire, of course, they're going to be disposed off in some fashion. But if -- but I always look at the -- I look to myself and I look at the entire team and I say, where do we stand as a management team in owning a portion of Nektar. And for example, I still have -- probably 80% of my vested shares are still sitting in the bank, so to speak, right? So I don't think there's been any unusual stock sales. I think the management is going to dispose off shares as they come close to expiration as stock options come close to expirations. But I also know that the team is well staked with vested shares and has a strong, strong belief that this company has enormous potential and a long way to go. And I don't see anybody disposing off shares that aren't reasonably close to expiration. So -- or I should say, options reasonably close to expiration. So I hope everybody understands that in some fashion, stock options are a form of compensation and it's not unusual to see that form of compensation taken advantage of by management, especially after such a successful performance in 2017 and so far in 2018. And quite frankly, while I'm always looking at this, I don't have a problem with people taking little bit of money off the table when shares are in the neighborhood of expiring, when options are in the neighborhood of expiring. I hope that answers the question."

So yes, actually we did a lot of studies in the preclinical lab understanding the nature of the tumor kind of like the cellularity of the tumor, the size of the tumor and the age. And from that, we actually have developed a number of models to allow us to translate dose administration and make predictions on how to scale and plan to do the dosing using the animal model as a guide. So certainly the first dose levels that we selected as well as the strategy and approach for the radiate -- for the needle-guided injections, those all came from information learned from the animal studies. And then in regards to the second part of your question, so we administered NKTR-262 in the protocol. It's infrequent.
[Audio Gap] 
so we necessarily need to repeatedly inject the tumors. So the way that we would be using that doublet or triplet is we would introduce intratumoral NKTR-262. But then systemically, we would give either NKTR-214 alone in the case of a doublet or NKTR-214 plus nivolumab in the case of the triplet. And then the patients would stay on the systemic therapy, and we would only readminister NKTR-262 if necessary upon restaging the patient."

And clearly, there's a strategy behind this, and it goes back to what I've said all along and I know JZ has said all along, which is a molecule that can cause the proliferation of effector T cells is the centerpiece of I-O. Without T cells, without effector T cells, I-O therapy starts to fall apart. So because what I believe is that we have the centerpiece of an I-O therapy and we also have other pieces, such as NKTR-262, I don't think we're dependent on checkpoint inhibition as a strategy. I think NKTR-214 carries its own strategy, and we're going to look at it with checkpoint modalities, but we'll also be looking at it with methods of creating antigens, such as NKTR-262, potentially neoantigen vaccines and potentially even chemotherapy approaches. So there's a number of different things you can do with NKTR-214 in a very broad way in immuno-oncology. And if you believe it's that center of that circle, which we think it is, then think of all the possibilities and all the different things you can do, even combinations with CAR-T therapies, which have proven enormously important, given their very short duration of effect. So I think we do have a strategy. We haven't mapped it out publicly yet. We're discussing possibilities with numerous companies. You can see what we just did with Takeda's small molecule. There is a lot of companies that want to work with NKTR-214. You know outside of the BMS collaboration, we're allowed to work with it in all these different approaches. And I think you're going to see a lot of studies start up over the coming year with NKTR-214 as that centerpiece."

Thanks, Mary, and thanks, Arlinda. So you know you highlighted a very interesting point. So TAK-659, it is a kinase inhibitor, but it's a very selective kinase inhibitor that has dual activity on a lone animal, and that's against SYK, which is spleen tyrosine kinase, and also the FLT-3, which is -- signals in response to the FLT-3 ligand. And so there are 2 really unique features of this particular TKI besides the cell activity. And the first is that with SYK, you engage the immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling. So these are the kind of ICAMs that you see in a lot of immune cells. And SYK is the key enzyme that controls the downstream signaling of those complexes and controls signaling to the downstream machinery such as phospholipase gamma and others. And we find that ICAMs can control signaling in a range of different cell types, not just in B cells, where we typically think of SYK, but also in monocytes and myeloid cells, even in high granular cells that rely on it for signaling. And we also noted that's the case with FLT as well is that's highly representative along the myeloid compartment. And so what is very unique is that in a lot of preclinical studies, Takeda scientists discovered that a lot of the suppressive cell populations that have the myeloid -- that are of the myeloid subset, I mean, in the tumor microenvironment are highly kind of almost addicted to these pathways. And then when you treat these kind of tumors, the cell populations themselves vanish or they dedifferentiate. And then particularly, what was very exciting was changing the plasticity of M1 macrophage phenotype creating a very large increase in the proinflammatory macrophage subset. So why this combination is so interesting to combine with NKTR-214 is that it really targets cell populations and cellular processes that NKTR-214 does not directly engage. And so that's why this doublet is very interesting. And I hope you have a chance to see the presentation at ASCO because the preclinical data with these 2 agents as a doublet is very, very compelling when we see some very, very strong preclinical results. And we're seeing those results pretty quickly that lead us into this advanced -- moving into this clinical collaboration with the first trial starting later this year."

And as you can imagine, partnering with BMS, we're able to leverage a lot of experience that they've had with the FDA on these topics. But in general, what you need to prove is that you can, with your 95% confidence interval for your objective response rate, that your lower bound of that 95% confidence interval rules out the point estimate for standard of care. So just to give you, like a specific example in terms of relapsed/refractory melanoma population, where those patients have been treated with a prior checkpoint inhibitor, a second-line treatment could be ipilimumab, which has about 13% objective response rate. So you would want to see an objective response rate somewhere around 20% or above 20%, where your 95% confidence interval, the lower bound would be above 13%. In terms of non-small cell lung cancer, post-I-O plus chemo or post-I-O, docetaxel is a very reasonable comparator in the second-line setting. And there's been a number of large Phase III trials that show that the objective response rate for docetaxel is roughly 9%. And so in the non-small cell lung cancer population that has been previously treated with an I/O agent, the doublet of NKTR-214 plus nivo, we had estimated has to have an objective response rate around 18% or higher to rule out the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval that's above 9%. Just to give you some ideas, when we do our statistical calculations, those cohorts need to be around 100 patients to be able to demonstrate that level of efficacy. I hope that helps."

On today's call, we will review our achievements since the beginning of this year for Nektar's pipeline and our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including our submission of an NDA for NKTR-181, which will occur this month and the continued advancement of our I-O portfolio with NKTR-214 entering Phase III trials and NKTR-262 now being evaluated in the recently initiated REVEAL study as well as our progress with our immunology program, NKTR-358.
We will also update our financial guidance for 2018, incorporating the upfront payments we received in the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, which recently closed. 
Already this year-to-date, we have achieved multiple successes with our pipeline of Nektar-invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas: Immuno-oncology, immunology and pain.
In the area of chronic pain, we will submit the NDA for NKTR-181 to the FDA this month. I'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of the team here at Nektar, as they've done a tremendous job over the last several months with both our FDA interactions and the preparation of the NDA incorporating FDA guidance.
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer.
Our new BMS collaboration, which became effective in April, provides a platform of us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, broadly and rapidly with over 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types. We believe this will also allow us to achieve our goal of establishing NKTR-214 as a backbone of cancer care across multiple indications. I'll talk more about this progress of this program in a moment.
And in immunology, as you saw, we announced this week, we have now advance NKTR-358 into patients with the initiation of a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in lupus patients.
So 2018 is off to a great start, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy.
So first, let's review NKTR-181. As you know, our highly productive interactions and pre-NDA meetings with the agency led to assembly of our NDA package, which includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. As I said earlier, we will submit the NDA this month. We incorporated the clear and collaborative guidance given to us by the FDA into our NDA submission. We believe that NKTR-181 is emerging at the right time to offer patients suffering from chronic pain an accessible and important potential new therapy, while also helping to address the current opioid public health emergency. Our mission with NKTR-181 from its invention was to provide pain relief to patients without the high risks of abuse and addiction found with today's opioid drugs.
As the first new full mu-opioid agonist molecule to be developed in over 50 years, NKTR-181's unique inherent properties position the drug to not only help stem the rate of new addiction to conventional opioids, but also to reduce diversion of prescription pain medicines for abuse.
NKTR-181 is not only an important therapy for patients, but is a major building block in the fight against opioid addiction in our country. We remain highly focused on finding the best way to bring this important new medicine to patients quickly following approval.
Because of NKTR-181's significant potential and the current financial strength of our company, our focus is to no -- is no longer on near term economics for NKTR-181, but rather to retain as much back-end value as possible. As such, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181, one of which is to establish a separate majority-owned subsidiary with one or more partners to launch this important molecule. This approach is consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while maximizing the value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders.
Now let's talk about NKTR-214. As you know, we recently entered into a transformative collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have already begun planning the most important next steps in the joint clinical development program for NKTR-214. The intent of the broad clinical development program is to advance this potential combination regimen in I-O to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. To that end, we are extremely pleased that we are planning to start our first Phase III trials for NKTR-214 with Opdivo in the third quarter of this year. The first 2 trials will be in first-line melanoma and first-line renal cell carcinoma, and we plan to share the preliminary trial designs at this year's ASCO meeting.
Beyond renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, one of our top priorities is this -- in the second half of 2018, will also be to design and launch our first registrational trials in lung cancer. BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged approach for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in lung cancer, which envisions multiple registrational trials in different patient populations. Under the framework of this new collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar are planning over 20 registrational-enabling trials that will enroll approximately 15,000 patients in 9 tumor types.
We were extremely pleased that the abstract from the PIVOT trial was accepted for oral presentation during the Developmental Therapeutics Immunotherapy session at ASCO. As you know, with an ongoing trial, the acceptance of an abstract is more difficult. And so we were delighted that the committee chose our abstract for an oral presentation. The abstract includes preliminary data from both escalation and expansion stages of PIVOT based on the database cut from early February. As this is an ongoing study, we plan to present our updated and new data at the meeting, which is consistent with how we presented ongoing data in the past, including at last year's Citi presentation. We will also host a webcast IR event on Saturday evening, following the oral presentation, which will include an expanded discussion of the preliminary updated data from PIVOT as well as a panel with 3 of our investigators. The panel will include: Lung oncologist, Dr. Scott Gettinger from Yale; melanoma specialist, Dr. Adi Diab from MD Anderson, who will present at the oral session; and Dr. Nizar Tannir, who is a renal cell and bladder cancer specialist, also from MD Anderson. We look forward to seeing many of you in Chicago for this event.
In addition to our notable oral presentation, there are a number of other preclinical presentations for NKTR-214 with additional mechanisms of action beyond checkpoint inhibition, which will also be showcased at ASCO. This includes our first presentation of preclinical data for NKTR-214 with Takeda's compound TAK-659 in preclinical models of both liquid and solid tumors.
As you know, we just initiated a new clinical collaboration with Takeda, which includes a Phase I study evaluating the combination of NKTR-214 with TAK-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study will start in the second half of this year. We're extremely excited about the possibilities of evaluating NKTR-214 for the first time in a liquid tumor setting. I'll let Jonathan talk about the unique synergies of the combination of these two I-O mechanisms in a moment as well as other preclinical presentations planned for ASCO.
Following the signing of Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology.
Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes: NKTR-262, a TLR7/8 agonist; and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can simulate both NK cells and memory T cells.
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The trial is enrolling up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line settings as well as refractory settings. The first stage of the trial is assessing the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. Following that, the second stage of the trial will have the option to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. We expect to have initial early data from some of the first patients in the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans.
This week, we announced that we have now dosed our first patients in the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus, and Jonathan will discuss this more in a moment. This program continues to advance quickly, and we expect initial data from the lupus study sometime in the second half of next year. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory indications.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jonathan."

I'll spend some time talking about the science behind combining NKTR-214 with other mechanisms beyond checkpoint inhibition and why we are so excited about this. And then, I'll cover the trial that Nektar and Lilly just initiated with NKTR-358.
As Howard stated earlier, NKTR-214 is a broad-based immune mechanism that we intend to establish as a keystone therapeutic in I-O. And in this capacity, there are many scientifically driven ways to combine NKTR-214 with other agents that have complementary and non-overlapping mechanisms in order to unlock the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. And in this regard, our approach is to go where the science leads us and think broadly to incorporate combinatorial mechanisms, expanding beyond checkpoint inhibition.
In March of this year, we began the REVEAL clinical trial, which evaluates the combination of NKTR-214 with our polymer conjugated intra-tumoral TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262.
NKTR-262 was designed expressly to be used in combination with NKTR-214. As a TLR7/8 agonist, NKTR-262 targets the innate immune system, and when combined with NKTR-214, which targets the adaptive immune system, this combination engages the same biological pathways that our immune system uses to fight infections, except in this case we use infrequent injection of NKTR-262 into 1 or 2 tumor lesions to educate the immune system, and NKTR-214 to expand and propagate the educated immune system response throughout the entire body to target all tumor lesions, even ones not injected with NKTR-262. We call this an abscopal immune response, and we routinely see this in preclinical tumor models using NKTR-262 and NKTR-214.
At AACR last month, we presented preclinical data showing the efficacy of this combination in multiple mouse and genetic tumor models. And in addition, we showed deep mechanism of action data demonstrating how the individual agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations and their modification of systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response.
We are very excited that the REVEAL trial is underway, and have designed the trial to include a robust biomarker program predicated on the translation of a unique mechanism of action for this combination.
In April of this year, we announced a new clinical collaboration with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659 for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 has shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659.
At ASCO, next month, we will present our first preclinical data evaluating this combination in multiple mouse tumor lines, modeling both liquid and solid tumors. We are very excited to advance NKTR-214 into the liquid tumor setting, and our first clinical study will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 plus TAK-659 in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the trial will begin later this year.
Additionally, we are conducting preclinical research in the syngeneic mouse tumor models evaluating doublet combinations of NKTR-214 with a PARP inhibitor and with a dipeptidyl peptidase, or DPP, a FAB inhibitor as well as in tumor models with neoantigen-based vaccines in order to explore a patient's specific personalized cancer vaccine strategy.
In all cases, we believe to have a strong scientific rationale for the combination that is both specific to the individual combination partners and the tumor selection for the intended use of each combination. The emerging data are very encouraging and some of this, as Howard mentioned, will also be presented at ASCO next month. And as we move forward with the development program for NKTR-214, we will prioritize which of these mechanisms we could advance into the clinic.
And I'd like to now expand on Howard's discussion of NKTR-358 and review the clinical trial we just started in lupus patients. As Howard said, NKTR-358 is a notable program for Nektar as it has great potential in a number of autoimmune disease states. It provides further evidence of our ability to optimize cytokine biology and use our core chemistry to control ligand receptor interactions to create potential new breakthrough medicines. This expertise is now well recognized by our large pharmaceutical partners, such as Bristol and Takeda, for NKTR-214 and, of course, with Lilly for NKTR-358.
Our collaboration with Lilly is now focused on the comprehensive development of NKTR-358. As you know, Nektar is responsible for all activities up to the end of Phase I, and then Lilly will take the lead from Phase II onwards. We've observed promising biomarker results in our ongoing Phase Ia study of NKTR-358, which is a single ascending dose-escalation trial in healthy volunteers. This trial evaluated safety, tolerability and mechanism-based immunological biomarkers associated with the pharmacodynamics of NKTR-358. We have now dose escalated several times and the trial is progressing very well. So far to date, we have observed dose-dependent increases in Treg levels, with no increases in conventional T cells or NK cells. And in fact, as Howard stated, the results in healthy volunteers track very well with the preclinical studies we conducted in monkeys.
And earlier this week, we dosed the first patients in the Phase Ib trial with NKTR-358, which is a multiple ascending dose-escalation study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, changes in disease-specific biomarkers and any clinical signs of activity in patients treated with repeat dose administrations of NKTR-358. The PD markers will include evaluation of Tregs, T conventional cells, the Th17 to Treg ratios, B cells and memory B cell levels, NK cells as well as disease-specific serum biomarkers, including anti-double stranded DNA antibodies and complement. We will measure clinical response using the SLE disease activity index. This study will inform the dose levels and design the Phase II studies that our partner Lilly will run in several different autoimmune diseases indications.
And with that, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's first quarter 2018 financial results, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance.
We ended the first quarter of 2018 with $333.8 million of cash and investments, which does not include the payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb for the strategic collaboration transaction that closed on April 3, 2018.
At the closing, we received $1.85 billion from BMS comprised of $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. For the first quarter, our revenue and expense line items were consistent with the annual guidance we gave on our year-end call.
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains largely unchanged. We have completed the revenue recognition analysis and our independent auditors are in the process of completing their audit procedures for the BMS collaboration payments that will be accounted for in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018.
We now expect to recognize substantially all of the $1 billion upfront payment as revenue in the second quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.1 billion. Our full year revenue guidance outside of the payments from the BMS collaboration is unchanged at $100 million to $110 million, and we expect the remaining revenue to be recognized ratably over the remaining quarters of 2018.
We continue to project 2018 GAAP R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $67 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. We now anticipate G&A expense for 2018 to be between $70 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million to $32 million of noncash depreciation and stock compensation expense. As I stated earlier, we plan to end 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion in cash and investments.

Well, first, I want to share with everybody that we were very honored to be selected as an oral presentation at ASCO. This year, there were over 6,400 abstracts submitted. So selection for podium time at ASCO is truly a distinction. And we shared we will have at least 100 patients who are I-O naïve that we're going to be presenting at ASCO. And given the clinical safety and efficacy data that we presented at Citi and, of course, the investigators that were already enrolling to the trial, accrual to the renal cell carcinoma and melanoma cohorts occurred more briskly. So therefore, at ASCO, we'll have the largest proportion of data for patients who have both first-line melanoma and first-line RCC and are stage IV disease. We're also going to have a handful of data for patients in lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as those investigators came on after our GU and melanoma oncologists, we'll have fewer patients in those populations. I also want to let you know that the abstract will be available next week and the data cut for our abstract was in early February, although we will be providing a more current update with data plans to be presented at ASCO. So the other thing that's very important to understand, Chris, is that when we present the PIVOT-02 data at ASCO, they're going to be a number of patients who have only had one post-treatment scan. And as you know, in our dose escalation data sets, we see patients having a deepening of response over time and an increase in the number of patients who respond as they stay on treatment. And of course, we've shared many times that patients are able to tolerate treatment and continue on the doublet because the treatment regimen is very well tolerated. So we'll clearly point out to you the studies -- the patients who have been on study longer and those patients who have had one scan and more than one scan. And so I just want to say, we're really looking forward to seeing you and everyone on this call at our ASCO presentation, and that's going to take place on Saturday, June 2, in the Developmental Therapeutics session between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m."

Remember, again, I have to emphasize that I -- what I just told Chris, but I want to tell you, too, Jessica, most of these patients are going to be on study with one scan. And so we do -- again, I want to emphasize that we see our efficacy data mature over time, and so we will have to provide you with the information about those patients who have been on the study longer and those patients who have only had one scan. Likewise, we will provide an update for those patients who were enrolled to the dose escalation, and we'll let you know how the patient with the complete response and the 2 patients that we previously reported to you that had partial response that were treated in the second-line non-small cell lung cancer setting."

I think, look, you -- all the management stock sales have been done under plans that were put in place some time ago. And for the most part, the sales of shares that you see are just a small percentage of the ownership of the management team and, quite frankly, are generally within a year of expiration. Now I think if you look at -- I always look at this myself because I think it's a very important question to ask, and I certainly know the investors are looking at this carefully, but if you look at the ownership and shares of the senior management team at Nektar, they probably still own 80% of their vested shares and they haven't been selling those. So if you come upon shares that are expiring or soon to expire, of course, they're going to be disposed of in some fashion. But if -- but I always look at the -- I look to myself and I look at the entire team and I say, where do we stand as a management team in owning a portion of Nektar. And for example, I still have -- probably 80% of my vested shares are still sitting in the bank, so to speak, right? So I don't think there's been any unusual stock sales. I think the management is going to dispose of shares as they come close to expiration as stock options come close to expirations. But I also know that the team is well staked with vested shares and has a strong, strong belief that this company has enormous potential and a long way to go. And I don't see anybody disposing off shares that aren't reasonably close to expiration. So -- or I should say, options reasonably close to expiration. So I hope everybody understands that in some fashion, stock options are a form of compensation and it's not unusual to see that form of compensation taken advantage of by management, especially after such a successful performance in 2017 and so far in 2018. And quite frankly, while I'm always looking at this, I don't have a problem with people taking little bit of money off the table when shares are in the neighborhood of expiring, when options are in the neighborhood of expiring. I hope that answers the question."

And then in regards to the second part of your question, so we administered NKTR-262 in the protocol. It's infrequent.
[Audio Gap] 
so we necessarily need to repeatedly inject the tumors. So the way that we would be using that doublet or triplet is we would introduce intratumoral NKTR-262. But then systemically, we would give either NKTR-214 alone in the case of a doublet or NKTR-214 plus nivolumab in the case of the triplet. And then the patients would stay on the systemic therapy, and we would only readminister NKTR-262 if necessary upon restaging the patient."

And clearly, there's a strategy behind this, and it goes back to what I've said all along and I know JZ has said all along, which is a molecule that can cause the proliferation of effector T cells is the centerpiece of I-O. Without T cells, without effector T cells, I-O therapy starts to fall apart. So because what I believe is that we have the centerpiece of an I-O therapy and we also have other pieces, such as NKTR-262, I don't think we're dependent on checkpoint inhibition as a strategy. I think NKTR-214 carries its own strategy, and we're going to look at it with checkpoint modalities, but we'll also be looking at it with methods of creating antigens, such as NKTR-262, potentially neoantigen vaccines and potentially even chemotherapy approaches. So there's a number of different things you can do with NKTR-214 in a very broad way in immuno-oncology. And if you believe it's that center of that circle, which we think it is, then think of all the possibilities and all the different things you can do, even combinations with CAR-T therapies, which have proven enormously important, given their very short duration of effect. So I think we do have a strategy. We haven't mapped it out publicly yet. We're discussing possibilities with numerous companies. You can see what we just did with Takeda's small molecule. There is a lot of companies that want to work with NKTR-214. You know outside of the BMS collaboration, we're allowed to work with it in all these different approaches.

Thanks, Mary, and thanks, Arlinda. So you know you highlighted a very interesting point. So TAK-659, it is a kinase inhibitor, but it's a very selective kinase inhibitor that has dual activity on a lone animal, and that's against SYK, which is spleen tyrosine kinase, and also the FLT-3, which is -- signals in response to the FLT-3 ligand. And so there are 2 really unique features of this particular TKI besides the cell activity. And the first is that with SYK, you engage the immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling. So these are the kind of ICAMs that you see in a lot of immune cells. And SYK is the key enzyme that controls the downstream signaling of those complexes and controls signaling to the downstream machinery such as phospholipase gamma and others. And we find that ICAMs can control signaling in a range of different cell types, not just in B cells, where we typically think of SYK, but also in monocytes and myeloid cells, even in high granular cells that rely on it for signaling. And we also noted that's the case with FLT as well is that's highly representative along the myeloid compartment. And so what is very unique is that in a lot of preclinical studies, Takeda scientists discovered that a lot of the suppressive cell populations that have the myeloid -- that are of the myeloid subset, I mean, in the tumor microenvironment are highly kind of almost addicted to these pathways. And then when you treat these kind of tumors, the cell populations themselves vanish or they dedifferentiate. And then particularly, what was very exciting was changing the plasticity of M1 macrophage phenotype creating a very large increase in the proinflammatory macrophage subset. So why this combination is so interesting to combine with NKTR-214 is that it really targets cell populations and cellular processes that NKTR-214 does not directly engage. And so that's why this doublet is very interesting. And I hope you have a chance to see the presentation at ASCO because the preclinical data with these 2 agents as a doublet is very, very compelling when we see some very, very strong preclinical results. And we're seeing those results pretty quickly that lead us into this advanced -- moving into this clinical collaboration with the first trial starting later this year."

And as you can imagine, partnering with BMS, we're able to leverage a lot of experience that they've had with the FDA on these topics. But in general, what you need to prove is that you can, with your 95% confidence interval for your objective response rate, that your lower bound of that 95% confidence interval rules out the point estimate for standard of care. So just to give you, like a specific example in terms of relapsed/refractory melanoma population, where those patients have been treated with a prior checkpoint inhibitor, a second-line treatment could be ipilimumab, which has about 13% objective response rate. So you would want to see an objective response rate somewhere around 20% or above 20%, where your 95% confidence interval, the lower bound would be above 13%. In terms of non-small cell lung cancer, post-I-O plus chemo or post-I-O, docetaxel is a very reasonable comparator in the second-line setting. And there's been a number of large Phase III trials that show that the objective response rate for docetaxel is roughly 9%. And so in the non-small cell lung cancer population that has been previously treated with an I/O agent, the doublet of NKTR-214 plus nivo, we had estimated has to have an objective response rate around 18% or higher to rule out the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval that's above 9%. Just to give you some ideas, when we do our statistical calculations, those cohorts need to be around 100 patients to be able to demonstrate that level of efficacy. I hope that helps."

On today's call, we will review our accomplishments in 2018 to date. And also our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including the initiation of the broad Phase III program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials starting this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers. 
We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018. 
I'll start by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved with our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines, across 3 therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. 
First in the area of chronic pain, we are exceptionally pleased that our NDA for NKTR-181 was accepted for filing by the FDA this month. I'd like to recognize the incredible job done by the team here at Nektar, which worked tirelessly on this goal over the past several months. 
Our NDA includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. 
Based on advice from the FDA and given the size of the database, we submitted the NDA for a standard review. We've been officially informed that our [indiscernible] date will be May 29, 2019, and that the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. 
As you know, we've had highly productive interactions in pre-NDA meetings with the agency, and we plan to work closely with them during the review as well.
As I stated last quarter, we are evaluating certain strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181. Our current focus is on establishing a separate subsidiary with one or more commercial or capital partners to launch this important molecule. 
We believe this option will allow Nektar to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while at the same time ensure we capture the maximum value of NKTR-181 for the shareholders. 
We're very excited about the potential about the NKTR-181 to help address the nation's immuno epidemic. 
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle, in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Following the signing of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our new Bristol-Myers collaboration became effective in April of this year. And as you know, provides a unique and brought platform for us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214 rapidly. 
The collaboration includes a broad joint development plan with 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types and 15,000 patients. 
Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have announced the planned start of the first 3 registrational trials, for NKTR-214 with OPDIVO this year, which will be in first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma and cisplatin-ineligible first-line bladder cancer. 
I'll let Mary talk more about these specific studies in the moment. As you know we're very excited about the data we continue to collect from the ongoing PIVOT studiy, and in particular, the translational work that shows that treatment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO will convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressers. 
As you'll  recall, we observe this conversion with NKTR 214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial of NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a double I-O regiment in many tumor types. 
As the first example, we're working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
Beyond these first tumor types, the next set of registrational trials in lung, breast, colorectal, gastric and sarcoma cancers are planned to start in the first half of next year. These studies are being designed and informed by the ongoing PIVOT data, which continue to mature over the next 6 to 9. 
BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged clinical development approach for NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. And this will include multiple registrational trials in each tumor type, including first line and relapse refractory settings. 
The PIVOT trial is ongoing with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO being tested in numerous patient cohorts. Recently, we added several new cohorts that will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO with various doses of YERVOY as well. 
The collaboration with Bristol and vision several paths forward in both the doublet and triplet regiments, and these cohorts will inform our designs of registrational trials. 
In addition to the triplet patient cohorts, we also added to PIVOT a new second line relapse refractory non-small cell lung cancer cohort that reflects to define patient operation based on the evolving standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer. 
The protocol now includes enrollment of patients, who have received single agent anti-PD-1 in need of the first or second line, and the second cohort will enroll patients who have received an anti-PD-1 regiment with the platinum doublet in first-line. 
As Mary stated during our recent ASCO presentation, we look forward to presenting new data from the fully enrolled 38 patient first-line melanoma cohorts in PIVOT at the upcoming Citi conference in November. 
As data from each of the PIVOT cohorts mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. 
We're also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214 by the end of this year. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's duel cyclic inhabiter, known as Tak-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor, [indiscernible], in patients with I-O refractory melanoma. 
We are also actively engaged in discussions with additional companies where there is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of NKTR-214 with other targeted and I-O agents. And we expect that before the end of this year, we will select which of these collaborations will move forward into the clinic. 
We continue to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214, includes NKTR-262, a TLR-78 agonist, and Nektar-255, an I-O 15 candidate which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. 
In April, we dosed the first patient in the reveal trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and 214 has enormous potential. 
Our preclinical data for the combination of these two agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, and modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response. 
The dose escalation phase of the trial was sequential NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is underway now to determine initial safety, PK and biomarker characterization. 
Following sequential dosing, we will evaluate concurrent dosing for the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. We will have also have the option later in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. 
We expect to have our first biomarker in safety data from the first patients in the sequential dose escalation phase of the trial, sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once we have identified the recommended Phase II dose, the trials projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NK-255, our I-O 15 candidate, we have been conducting important preclinical studies in combination with multiple experimental car T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
I-O 15 is associated with the remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone car T regiments, so we are excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance car T outcomes, as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. 
Our preclinical work with car T is progressing nicely, and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year.
Now moving onto our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 and healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels, with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. 
We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple sending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial's advancing very quickly. We expect to present initial data from the Phase I trial, and initial data from the lupus trial at medical meetings in the first half and second half of 2019 respectively. 
We're very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune disease and chronic inflammatory indications. 
So I'm very pleased with our results in the first half of 2018, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mary to discuss the Phase III trials in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer."

I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and [indiscernible] carcinoma, which Howard mentioned, are the first 3 tumor times in which BMS and Nektar are initiating registrational trials by the end of this year. 
Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus PIVOT as the standard of care. 
First in melanoma, we're very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, who is the only company to have developed an immuno-oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. 
The Phase III trial of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO will enroll 760 patients within advanced and metastatic melanoma, who will be stratified by PD-L1 status stage of disease and B-rev status. The primary endpoints are PFS and OS, with a projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open label design into our competitor arm, and we are very excited to initiate this trial. 
This typical study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the first-line I-O standard of care. The Phase III trial design will be available on clinical trials that gov shortly and enrollment should begin within the next month. Renal cell carcinoma Bristol-Myers and Nektar and planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advance renal cell carcinoma patients, which will include several trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regiments of NKTR-214 plus PIVOT, and NKTR-214 plus PIVOT in near across multiple early and later stage settings. 
These trial designs will be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In broader, we're also planning a registration program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Since ASCO, we have enrolled additional patients into the first-line to [indiscernible] ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer cohort in PIVOT. And the ORR continues to be consistent in this patient population. 
As you know, this is a patient population with a very high unmet need, particularly, for individuals who have tumors with PD-L1 negative disease of baseline, and for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. 
With this in mind, we have several potential trial designs in bladder cancer, including ones that focus on this underserved patient population. We will review our program with regulatory agency shortly so that we can be ready to initiate our first registrational trials in bladder cancer by year-end. 
As Howard stated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual 6 fit inhibitor, known as TAK-659 into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. 
TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells, and increase levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. 
Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique, nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. 
As a first trial with NKTR-214, liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who have relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, with no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect the first data from this trial towards the the end of 2019. 
With Syndax, we're in the process of designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214 with Intinistat in patients with I-O relapsed or refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the study design before the end of this year. 
With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's second quarter 2018 revenue, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance to incorporate our final accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration, which closed in the second quarter.
We ended the second quarter with $2.106 billion of cash and investments. At the closing of the strategic collaboration with BMS on April 3, we received $1.85 billion, which includes a $1 billion upfront payment, and an $850 million premium equity investment. 
We recorded the equity investment at fair value on the April 3 closing date, estimated to be $790 million, which reflected that the price of our stock on the closing date, and a discount for the unregistered status of the shares issued to BMS. This resulted in $790 million being recorded as additional paid in capital, and the remaining $1.06 billion being recorded as revenue in Q2 based on our GAAP revenue accounting conclusions regarding the units of accounting in the collaboration arrangement and the allocation of value to those units. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains unchanged other than incorporating our final GAAP revenue accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration transaction. 
Our full year revenue guidance of $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS payments, and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalty and other revenue. 
We expect the remaining $40 million to $50 million in our full year revenue guidance to be recognized rapidly over the last 2 quarters of 2018. 
Our GAAP expense guidance is unchanged. We anticipate 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock composition and depreciation expense. 
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.
And with that, I will open the call for questions. Operator?"

In addition, after the release of the keynote 189 data, we think there is a very important opportunity for those patients who have actually either relapsed or refractory to a frontline I-O agent and we also are pursuing a second line strategy that is both embedded into our pay with 02 study as well as randomized controlled studies. Third, we also believe that there is an opportunity for those patients who have on resected a stage three lung cancer and we go on to an iron regiment such as diploma ma'am and we are also in can get opportunity in stage III patients.

So we plan to maintain data visibility with a continual stream of presentations at scientific meetings. And moving forward, we're going to do just as you're talking about as present either by individual cohorts at distinct meetings. So this means that over the course of 6 to 18 months when we have sufficient maturity of the data, we are very thoughtfully planning with BMS where two percent that lung data as you mentioned as well as all the other cohorts to highlight our results. And remember, one of our primary goals is going to be to educate the medical oncology community who are going to be participating in our rental registrational trials. So while some of the presentations are going to be at the larger general oncology conferences such as ASCO or conference call, we are also planning presenting at more tumor specific focus symposium's where we can capture a large audience such as the thoracic oncology community. Remember that PIVOT data is maturing at different rates and I think you were very well aware in a cohort like first-line RCC, the response rate has increased over time and so the maturation of the data in RCC could be very different than say what we're seeing in urothelial cancer where we show you a very rapid response to the doublet treatment with 6 out of 10 patients having objective response, after we presented at ASCO. 
So Howard made it very clear to today too that at SITC that we'll be providing a full update on our first-line melanoma cohorts that includes 38 patients at SITC this year. And those patients will all have had a 6 months follow-up at the time of our presentation."

In PIVOT-02, we have 2 relapsed refractory cohorts, one that would allow three patients to have a single agent checkpoint inhibitor in frontline, as well as patients who had a chemotherapy doublet, then went on a single agent checkpoint inhibitor. So we actually have one cohort that allows second or third line patients, and then we have a cohort that could serve potentially as an accelerated approval cohort patient who just bailed chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in the first-line. And then those would be second line relapse refractory patients. Going back to the same question that Chris asked is when will we have data? We really are going to be transparent once we have mature data, and we're going to be presenting data at the scientific conference. Today, Howard's made it really clear that we're going to be at conference call as we promised at ASCO, showing the first-line melanoma data and then the 6-month follow-up data really is journal fans of where we believe data will be matured. Obviously is some data may be mature we are currently and in the relax refractory setting we may see it takes a little bit longer for patients to respond to treatment. We also will always ask you to keep in mind we see deepening of response saying over time as we follow patients and we also see increased number of patients to respond as we go over time and just in our conference call loan, we've seen one patient on the fixed can convert from stable disease to a responder. So we do know that in certain tumor types, it's going to take longer for the data mature and in other tumor types, it will be more quickly. As we make a decision on the presenting the data, we will ensure that our investors and our scientific community are aware of that."

Yes so Bert, one of the key things we did in this trial is that we made sure that in both our blood-based collections and tumor-based collections, we could delineate the mechanism of NKTR-262 as it mitigates the TLR-78 pathway. And then in addition, see how that delineation stacks against the NKTR-214 specific sense of immune activation. So in the tumor and in the blood, we have a number of biomarkers that detect type one Interferon our activity. And so that's associated with the kind of [indiscernible] interference singling pathway that, that TLR engages. So we can take that both in the tumor and in the blood in terms of both molecular biomarkers such as gene expression. But then also changes at the protein and cellular level because the TLR engages different cell populations than does NKTR-214. So those 2 sets of biomarkers specific to 262 and specific to 214 are very important. We use them together. Those show a differentiation of this combination from NKTR-214 alone, for example. I mean they're also just relaly informed on the types of tumors and the way we would use the combination going forward."

Now to get there, first we need to review our strategic strategy with the FDA and health authorities and we are moving rapidly to do that in order to launch our Pivotal trials by the end of this year. Likewise, as you heard today that the melanoma primary efficacy endpoint is projected for 22 months after the first patient is and, we also have always said that in periods 02, we have potential of potential to convert the study into registrational study for a patient population with the high unmet medical need. And certainly, those patients who received checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer we also qualify for high unmet medical need as the relapse from that combination. there are also others like third one urothelial carcinoma population or relapsed refractory melanoma population. So we've always created a strategy that will allow us to leverage data quickly from the private to study to launch into definitive history studies as well as potentially move any of those cohorts into a rapid accelerated approval pathway and we have had those conversations with the FDA which allows us to convert the PIVOT-02 into registrational study and so as we move forward, we believe that while the melanoma study will have a read out and 22 months, there are other opportunities for potential accelerated approval."

On today's call, we will review our accomplishments in 2018 to date. And also our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including the initiation of the broad Phase III program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials starting this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers. 
We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018. 
I'll start by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved with our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines, across 3 therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. 
First in the area of chronic pain, we are exceptionally pleased that our NDA for NKTR-181 was accepted for filing by the FDA this month. I'd like to recognize the incredible job done by the team here at Nektar, which worked tirelessly on this goal over the past several months. 
Our NDA includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. 
Based on advice from the FDA and given the size of the database, we submitted the NDA for a standard review. We've been officially informed that our PDUFA date will be May 29, 2019, and that the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. 
As you know, we've had highly productive interactions in pre-NDA meetings with the agency, and we plan to work closely with them during the review as well.
As I stated last quarter, we are evaluating certain strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181. Our current focus is on establishing a separate subsidiary with one or more commercial or capital partners to launch this important molecule. 
We believe this option will allow Nektar to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while at the same time ensure we capture the maximum value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders. 
We are very excited about the potential about the NKTR-181 to help address the nation's opioid epidemic. 
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle, in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Following the signing of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our new Bristol-Myers collaboration became effective in April of this year and, as you know, provides a unique and brought platform for us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214 rapidly. 
The collaboration includes a broad joint development plan with 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types and 15,000 patients. 
Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have announced the planned start of the first 3 registrational trials for NKTR-214 with OPDIVO this year, which will be in first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma and cisplatin-ineligible first-line bladder cancer. 
I'll let Mary talk more about these specific studies in a moment. As you know we're very excited about the data we continue to collect from the ongoing PIVOT study, and in particular, the translational work that shows that treatment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressers. 
As you'll  recall, we observe this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial of NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regimen in many tumor types. 
As the first example, we're working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
Beyond these first tumor types, the next set of registrational trials in lung, breast, colorectal, gastric and sarcoma cancers are planned to start in the first half of next year. These studies are being designed and informed by the ongoing PIVOT data, which continue to mature over the next 6 to 9 months. 
BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged clinical development approach for NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. And this will include multiple registrational trials in each tumor type, including first line and relapsed refractory settings. 
The PIVOT trial is ongoing with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO being tested in numerous patient cohorts. Recently, we added several new cohorts that will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO with various doses of YERVOY as well. 
The collaboration with Bristol envisions several paths forward in both the doublet and triplet regiments, and these cohorts will inform our designs of registrational trials. 
In addition to the triplet patient cohorts, we also added to PIVOT a new second line relapse refractory non-small cell lung cancer cohort that reflects a defined patient population based on the evolving standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer. 
The protocol now includes enrollment of patients who have received single agent anti-PD-1 in need of the first or second line, and the second cohort will enroll patients who have received an anti-PD-1 regimen with a platinum doublet in first-line. 
As Mary stated during our recent ASCO presentation, we look forward to presenting new data from the fully enrolled 38 patient first-line melanoma cohorts in PIVOT at the upcoming SITC conference in November. 
As data from each of the PIVOT cohorts mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. 
We are also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214 by the end of this year. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor entinostat, in patients with I-O refractory melanoma. 
We are also actively engaged in discussions with additional companies where there is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of NKTR-214 with other targeted and I-O agents. And we expect that before the end of this year, we will select which of these collaborations will move forward into the clinic. 
We continue to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214, includes NKTR-262, a TLR-78 agonist, and Nektar-255, an I-O 15 candidate which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. 
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and 214 has enormous potential. 
Our preclinical data for the combination of these two agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, and modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response. 
The dose escalation phase of the trial was sequential NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is underway now to determine initial safety, PK and biomarker characterization. 
Following sequential dosing, we will evaluate concurrent dosing for the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. We will have also have the option later in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. 
We expect to have our first biomarker and safety data from the first patients in the sequential dose escalation phase of the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once we have identified the recommended Phase II dose, the trial is projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NK-255, our I-O 15 candidate, we have been conducting important preclinical studies in combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
I-O 15 is associated with the remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regimens, so we are excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance CAR-T outcomes, as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. 
Our preclinical work with CAR-T is progressing nicely, and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year.
Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels, with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. 
We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial is advancing very quickly. We expect to present initial data from the Phase I trial, and initial data from the lupus trial at medical meetings in the first half and second half of 2019 respectively. 
We're very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune disease and chronic inflammatory indications. 
So I'm very pleased with our results in the first half of 2018, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mary to discuss the Phase III trials in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer."

Our str",608,"Thanks, Howard. I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned, are the first 3 tumor times in which BMS and Nektar are initiating registrational trials by the end of this year. 
Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the standard of care. 
First in melanoma, we're very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, who is the only company to have developed an immuno-oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. 
The Phase III trial of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO will enroll 760 patients within advanced and metastatic melanoma, who will be stratified by PD-L1 status stage of disease and B-rev status. The primary endpoints are PFS and OS, with a projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open label design into our comparator arm, and we are very excited to initiate this trial. 
This typical study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the first-line I-O standard of care. The Phase III trial design will be available on clinicaltrials.gov shortly and enrollment should begin within the next month. 
In renal cell carcinoma Bristol-Myers and Nektar and planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO, and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO and YERVOY across multiple early and later stage settings. 
These trial designs will be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registration program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Since ASCO, we have enrolled additional patients into the first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer cohort in PIVOT. And the ORR continues to be consistent in this patient population. 
As you know, this is a patient population with a very high unmet need, particularly, for individuals who have tumors with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline, and for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. 
With this in mind, we have several potential trial designs in bladder cancer, including ones that focus on this underserved patient population. We will review our program with regulatory agencies shortly so that we can be ready to initiate our first registrational trials in bladder cancer by year-end. 
As Howard stated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659 into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. 
TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and increase levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. 
Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique, nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. 
As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who have relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect the first data from this trial towards the end of 2019. 
With Syndax, we're in the process of designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214 with entinostat in patients with I-O relapsed or refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the study design before the end of this year. 
With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's second quarter 2018 revenue, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance to incorporate our final accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration, which closed in the second quarter.
We ended the second quarter with $2.106 billion of cash and investments. At the closing of the strategic collaboration with BMS on April 3, we received $1.85 billion, which includes a $1 billion upfront payment, and an $850 million premium equity investment. 
We recorded the equity investment at fair value on the April 3 closing date, estimated to be $790 million, which reflected the price of our stock on the closing date, and a discount for the unregistered status of the shares issued to BMS. This resulted in $790 million being recorded as additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $1.06 billion being recorded as revenue in Q2 based on our GAAP revenue accounting conclusions regarding the units of accounting in the collaboration arrangement and the allocation of value to those units. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains unchanged other than incorporating our final GAAP revenue accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration transaction. 
Our full year revenue guidance of $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS payments, and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalty and other revenue. 
We expect the remaining $40 million to $50 million in our full year revenue guidance to be recognized ratably over the last 2 quarters of 2018. 
Our GAAP expense guidance is unchanged. We anticipate 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. 
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.
And with that, I will open the call for questions. Operator?"

And we do believe there are opportunities in all three of the segments, although the clinical trials may not look the exact same for each one of those patient populations. In addition, after the release of the KEYNOTE-189 data, we think there is a very important opportunity for those patients who have actually either relapsed or are refractory to a frontline I-O agent and we also are pursuing a second line strategy that is both embedded into our PIVOT-02 study as well as randomized controlled studies. 
Third, we also believe that there is an opportunity for those patients who have unresectable stage three lung cancer and would go on to an I-O regimen such as durvalumab and so we are looking also at an opportunity in stage III patients. 
And then fourth, we also are looking at designing trials for those patients who have early-stage lung cancer that is resectable. And so we are moving forward with a broad strategy and those are some of the possibilities, not all of them, but some other possibilities that are top of our mind."

So we plan to maintain data visibility with a continual stream of presentations at scientific meetings. And moving forward, we're going to do just as you're talking about, is present either by individual cohorts at distinct meetings. So this means that over the course of 6 to 18 months when we have sufficient maturity of the data, we are very thoughtfully planning with BMS where to present the lung data, as you mentioned, as well as all of the other cohorts to highlight our results. And remember, one of our primary goals is going to be to educate the medical oncology community who are going to be participating in our 20 registrational trials. So while some of the presentations are going to be at the large general oncology conferences such as ASCO or SITC, we are also planning presenting at more tumor-specific focused symposium's where we could capture a large audience, such as the thoracic oncology community. Remember that PIVOT data is maturing at different rates and I think you are very well aware in a cohort like first-line RCC, the response rate has increased over time and so the maturation of the data in RCC could be very different than, say, what we're seeing in urothelial cancer where we showed you a very rapid response to the doublet treatment with 6 out of 10 patients having objective response, which we presented at ASCO. 
So Howard made it very clear to today too that at SITC we'll be providing a full update on our first-line melanoma cohorts that includes 38 patients, at SITC this year. And those patients will all have had a 6-month follow-up at the time of our presentation."

In PIVOT-02, we have 2 relapsed refractory cohorts, one that would allow those patients who had a single agent checkpoint inhibitor in frontline, as well as patients who had a chemotherapy doublet, then went on a single agent checkpoint inhibitor. So we actually have one cohort that allows second or third line patients, and then we have a cohort that could serve potentially as an accelerated approval cohort of patients who just failed chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in the first-line, and then those would be second line relapse refractory patients. 
Going back to the same question that Chris asked, is when will we have data? We really are going to be transparent once we have mature data, and are going to be presenting data at a scientific conference. Today, Howard's made it really clear that we're going to be at SITC call as we promised, at ASCO showing the first-line melanoma data and then the 6-month follow-up data really is a general sense of when we believe data will be mature. Obviously is some data may be mature more quickly and in the relapse refractory setting we may see it takes a little bit longer for patients to respond to treatment. We also will always ask you to keep in mind we see deepening of response over time as we follow  patients and we also see increased number of patients who respond as we go over time and just in RCC alone, we've seen one patient on the fifth scan convert from stable disease to a responder. So we do know that in certain tumor types, it's going to take longer for the data mature and in other tumor types it will be more quickly. As we make a decision on the presenting the data, we will ensure that our investors and our scientific community are aware of that."

Yes, so Bert, one of the key things we did in this trial is that we made sure that in both our blood-based collections and tumor-based collections, we could delineate the mechanism of NKTR-262 as it engages the TLR-78 pathway. And then in addition, see how that delineation stacks against the NKTR-214 specific sets of immune activation. So in the tumor and in the blood, we have a number of biomarkers that detect type one interferon activity. And so that's associated with the kind of interferon signaling pathway that, that TLR engages. So we can detect that both in the tumor and in the blood in terms of both molecular biomarkers such as gene expression. But then also changes at the protein and cellular level because the TLR engages different cell populations than does NKTR-214. So those 2 sets of biomarkers specific to 262 and specific to 214 are very important. We use them together. They'll show us the differentiation of this combination from NKTR-214 alone, for example. And it will also just really inform the types of tumors and the way we would use the combination going forward."

We haven't gone into all the details of our bladder strategy, but certainly, what we're exploring is an accelerated or rapid pathway to approval. Now to get there, of course we need to review our strategic strategy with the FDA and with health authorities and we are moving rapidly to do that in order to launch our Pivotal trials by the end of this year. Likewise, as you heard today that the melanoma primary efficacy endpoint is projected for 22 months after the first patient is in. We also have always said that in PIVOT-02, we have potential of potential to convert the study into registrational study for a patient population with a high unmet medical need. And certainly, those patients who receive a checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer would also qualify for high unmet medical need as they relapse from that combination. There are also others, like a third line urothelial carcinoma population or relapsed refractory melanoma population. So we've always created a strategy that would allow us to leverage data quickly from the PIVOT-02 study to launch into definitive Phase III studies as well as potentially move any of those cohorts into a rapid accelerated approval pathway. And we have had those conversations with the FDA which allows us to convert the PIVOT-02 into a registrational study and so as we move forward, we believe that while the melanoma study will have a read out in 22 months, there are other opportunities for potential accelerated approval."

On today's call, we will review our accomplishments in 2018 to date. And also our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including the initiation of the broad Phase III program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials starting this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers. We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018. 
I'll start by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved with our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. 
First in the area of chronic pain, we are exceptionally pleased that our NDA for NKTR-181 was accepted for filing by the FDA this month. I'd like to recognize the incredible job done by the team here at Nektar, which worked tirelessly on this goal over the past several months. 
Our NDA includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. 
Based on advice from the FDA and given the size of the database, we submitted the NDA for a standard review. We've been officially informed that our PDUFA date will be May 29, 2019, and that the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. 
As you know, we've had highly productive interactions in pre-NDA meetings with the agency, and we plan to work closely with them during the review as well.
As I stated last quarter, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181. Our current focus is on establishing a separate subsidiary with one or more commercial or capital partners to launch this important molecule. 
We believe this option will allow Nektar to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while at the same time ensure we capture the maximum value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-181 to help address the nation's opioid epidemic. 
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Following the signing of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our new Bristol-Myers collaboration became effective in April this year and, as you know, provides a unique and broad platform for us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, rapidly. The collaboration includes a broad joint development plan with 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types and 15,000 patients. 
Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have announced the planned start of the first 3 registrational trials for NKTR-214 with OPDIVO this year, which will be in first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma and cisplatin-ineligible first-line bladder cancer. 
I'll let Mary talk more about these specific studies in a moment. As you know, we're very excited about the data we continue to collect from the ongoing PIVOT study, and in particular, the translational work that shows that treatment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressers. 
As you'll recall, we observe this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial of NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regimen in many different tumor types. 
As the first example, we're working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
Beyond these first tumor types, the next set of registrational trials in lung, breast, colorectal, gastric and sarcoma cancers are planned to start in the first half of next year. These studies are being designed and informed by the ongoing PIVOT data, which continue to mature over the next 6 to 9 months. 
BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged clinical development approach for NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. And this will include multiple registrational trials in each tumor type, including first line and relapsed refractory settings. 
The PIVOT trial is ongoing with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO being tested in numerous patient cohorts. Recently, we added several new cohorts that will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO with various doses of YERVOY as well. 
The collaboration with Bristol envisions several paths forward in both the doublet and triplet regimens, and these cohorts will inform our designs of registrational trials. 
In addition to the triplet patient cohorts, we also added to PIVOT a new second line relapse refractory non-small cell lung cancer cohort that reflects a defined patient population based on the evolving standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer. The protocol now includes enrollment of patients who have received single agent anti-PD-1 in either the first or second line, and the second cohort will enroll patients who have received an anti-PD-1 regimen with a platinum doublet in first-line. 
As Mary stated during our recent ASCO presentation, we look forward to presenting new data from the fully enrolled 38 patient first-line melanoma cohort in PIVOT at the upcoming SITC conference in November. 
As data from each of the PIVOT cohorts mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. 
We are also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214 by the end of this year. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, in patients with I-O refractory melanoma. 
We are also actively engaged in discussions with additional companies where there is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of NKTR-214 with other targeted and I-O agents. And we expect that before the end of this year, we will select which of these collaborations will move forward into the clinic. 
We continue to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TLR-78 agonist, and Nektar-255, an I-O 15 candidate which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. 
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and 214 has enormous potential. 
Our preclinical data for the combination of these 2 agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, and modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response. 
The dose escalation phase of the trial with sequential NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is underway now to determine initial safety, PK and biomarker characterization. 
Following sequential dosing, we will evaluate concurrent dosing for the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. We will also have the option later in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. 
We expect to have our first biomarker and safety data from the first patients in the sequential dose escalation phase of the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once we have identified the recommended Phase II dose, the trial is projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NKTR-255, our I-O 15 candidate, we have been conducting important preclinical studies in combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
I-O 15 has been associated with the remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regimens, so we are excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance CAR-T outcomes, as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. 
Our preclinical work with CAR-T is progressing nicely, and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year.
Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels, with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. 
We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial is advancing very quickly. We expect to present initial data from the Phase I trial, and initial data from the lupus trial at medical meetings in the first half and second half of 2019, respectively. 
We're very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune disease and chronic inflammatory indications. 
So I'm very pleased with our results in the first half of 2018, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mary to discuss the Phase III trials in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer."

Our str",609,"Thanks, Howard. I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned, are the first 3 tumor types in which BMS and Nektar are initiating registrational trials by the end of this year. 
Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the standard of care. 
First in melanoma, we're very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, who is the only company to have developed an immuno-oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. 
The Phase III trial of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO will enroll 760 patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma, who will be stratified by PD-L1 status, stage of disease and B-rev status. The primary endpoints are PFS and OS, with a projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open label design into our comparator arm, and we are very excited to initiate this trial. 
This typical study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the first-line I-O standard of care. The Phase III trial design will be available on clinicaltrials.gov shortly and enrollment should begin within the next month. 
In renal cell carcinoma, Bristol-Myers and Nektar are planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO, and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO and YERVOY across multiple early and later stage settings. These trial designs will be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registrational program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Since ASCO, we have enrolled additional patients into the first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer cohort in PIVOT. And the ORR continues to be consistent in this patient population. 
As you know, this is a patient population with a very high unmet need, particularly for individuals who have tumors with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline, and for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. 
With this in mind, we have several potential trial designs in bladder cancer, including ones that focus on this underserved patient population. We will review our program with regulatory agencies shortly so that we can be ready to initiate our first registrational trial in bladder cancer by year-end. 
As Howard stated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. 
TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and increase levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. 
Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique, nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. 
As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who are relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect the first data from this trial towards the end of 2019. 
With Syndax, we are in the process of designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214 with entinostat in patients with I-O relapsed or refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the study design before the end of this year. 
With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's second quarter 2018 revenue, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance to incorporate our final accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration, which closed in the second quarter.
We ended the second quarter with $2.106 billion of cash and investments. At the closing of the strategic collaboration with BMS on April 3, we received $1.85 billion, which includes a $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. 
We recorded the equity investment at fair value on the April 3 closing date, estimated to be $790 million, which reflected the price of our stock on the closing date and a discount for the unregistered status of the shares issued to BMS. This resulted in $790 million being recorded as additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $1.06 billion being recorded as revenue in Q2, based on our GAAP revenue accounting conclusions regarding the units of accounting in the collaboration arrangement and the allocation of value to those units. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains unchanged other than incorporating our final GAAP revenue accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration transaction. 
Our full year revenue guidance of $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS payments, and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalty and other revenue. 
We expect the remaining $40 million to $50 million in our full year revenue guidance to be recognized ratably over the last 2 quarters of 2018. 
Our GAAP expense guidance is unchanged. We anticipate 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. 
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.
And with that, I will open the call for questions. Operator?"

And we do believe there are opportunities in all three of the segments, although the clinical trials may not look the exact same for each one of those patient populations. In addition, after the release of the KEYNOTE-189 data, we think there is a very important opportunity for those patients who have actually either relapsed or are refractory to a frontline I-O agent and we also are pursuing a second line strategy that is both embedded into our PIVOT-02 study as well as randomized placebo -- randomized controlled studies. 
Third, we also believe that there is an opportunity for those patients who have unresectable stage III lung cancer and would go on to an I-O regimen such as durvalumab and so we are looking also at an opportunity in stage III patients. 
And then fourth, we also are looking at designing trials for those patients who have early-stage lung cancer that is resectable. And so we were moving forward with a broad strategy and those are some of the possibilities, not all of them, but some of the possibilities that are top of our mind."

So we plan to maintain data visibility with a continual stream of presentations at scientific meetings. And moving forward, we're going to do just as you were talking about, is present either by individual cohorts at distinct meetings. So this means that over the course of 6 to 18 months when we have sufficient maturity of the data, we are very thoughtfully planning with BMS where to present the lung data, as you mentioned, as well as all of the other cohorts to highlight our results. And remember, one of our primary goals is going to be to educate the medical oncology community who are going to be participating in our 20 registrational trials. So while some of the presentations are going to be at the large general oncology conferences such as ASCO or SITC, we also are planning presenting at more tumor-specific focused symposiums where we could capture a large audience, such as the thoracic oncology community. Remember that PIVOT data is maturing at different rates and I think you are very well aware in a cohort like first-line RCC, the response rate has increased over time and so the maturation of the data in RCC could be very different than, say, what we're seeing in urothelial cancer where we showed you a very rapid response to the doublet treatment with 6 out of 10 patients having objective response, which we presented at ASCO. 
So Howard made it very clear today too that at SITC we'll be providing a full update on our first-line melanoma cohorts that includes 38 patients at SITC this year. And those patients will all have had a 6-month follow-up at the time of our presentation."

In PIVOT-02, we have 2 relapsed refractory cohorts, one that would allow those patients who had a single agent checkpoint inhibitor in frontline, as well as patients who had a chemotherapy doublet, then went on a single agent checkpoint inhibitor. So we actually have one cohort that allows second or third line patients, and then we have a cohort that could serve potentially as an accelerated approval cohort of patients who just failed chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in the first-line, and then those would be second line relapse refractory patients. 
Going back to the same question that Chris asked, is when will we have data? We really are going to be transparent once we have mature data, and are going to be presenting data at a scientific conference. Today, Howard's made it really clear that we're going to be at SITC as we promised, at ASCO showing the first-line melanoma data and then the 6-month follow-up data really is a general sense of when we believe data will be mature. Obviously, some data may be mature more quickly and in the relapse refractory setting we may see it takes a little bit longer for patients to respond to treatment. We also will always ask you to keep in mind we see deepening of responses over time as we follow patients and we also see increased number of patients who respond as we go over time and just in RCC alone, we've seen 1 patient on the fifth scan convert from stable disease to a responder. So we do know that in certain tumor types, it's going to take longer for the data to mature and in other tumor types it will be more quickly. As we make a decision on the presenting the data, we will ensure that our investors and our scientific community are aware of that."

Yes, so Bert, one of the key things that we did in this trial is we made sure that in both our blood-based collections and tumor-based collections, we could delineate the mechanism of NKTR-262 as it engages the TLR-78 pathway. And then in addition, see how that delineation stacks against the NKTR-214 specific sets of immune activation. So in the tumor and in the blood, we have a number of biomarkers that detect type one interferon activity. And so that's associated with the kind of interferon signaling pathway that, that TLR engages. So we can detect that both in the tumor and in the blood in terms of both molecular biomarkers such as gene expression. But then also changes at the protein and cellular level because the TLR engages different cell populations than does NKTR-214. So those 2 sets of biomarkers specific to 262 and specific to 214 are very important. We use them together. They'll show us the differentiation of this combination from NKTR-214 alone, for example. And it will also just really inform the types of tumors and the way we would use the combination going forward."

Now to get there, of course we need to review our strategic strategy with the FDA and with health authorities and we are moving rapidly to do that in order to launch our Pivotal trials by the end of this year. Likewise, as you heard today that the melanoma primary efficacy endpoint is projected for 22 months after the first patient is in. We also have always said that in PIVOT-02, we have potential of potential to convert that study into a registrational study for a patient population with a high unmet medical need. And certainly, those patients who receive a checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer would also qualify for high unmet medical need as they relapse from that combination. There are also others, like a third line urothelial carcinoma population or relapsed refractory melanoma population. So we have always created a strategy that would allow us to leverage data quickly from the PIVOT-02 study to launch into definitive Phase III studies as well as potentially move any of those cohorts into a rapid accelerated approval pathway. And we have had those conversations with the FDA which allows us to convert the PIVOT-02 into a registrational study and so as we move forward, we believe that while the melanoma study will have a read out in 22 months, there are other opportunities for potential accelerated approval."

On today's call, we will review our accomplishments in 2018 to date. And also our planned milestones over the next 12 months, including the initiation of the broad Phase III program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials starting this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers. We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018. 
I'll start by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved with our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. First in the area of chronic pain, we are exceptionally pleased that our NDA for NKTR-181 was accepted for filing by the FDA this month. I'd like to recognize the incredible job done by the team here at Nektar, which worked tirelessly on this goal over the past several months. 
Our NDA includes an extensive amount of efficacy and safety data in over 2,100 patients and healthy subjects. Based on advice from the FDA and given the size of the database, we submitted the NDA for a standard review. We've been officially informed that our PDUFA date will be May 29, 2019, and that the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. 
As you know, we've had highly productive interactions in pre-NDA meetings with the agency, and we plan to work closely with them during the review as well.
As I stated last quarter, we are evaluating several strategic structural alternatives for the commercialization of NKTR-181. Our current focus is on establishing a separate subsidiary with one or more commercial or capital partners to launch this important molecule. 
We believe this option will allow Nektar to focus our efforts and resources on the development of Nektar's immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline, while at the same time ensure we capture the maximum value of NKTR-181 for our shareholders. We are very excited about the potential of NKTR-181 to help address the nation's opioid epidemic. 
In immuno-oncology, we remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Following the signing of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. 
Our new Bristol-Myers collaboration became effective in April this year and, as you know, provides a unique and broad platform for us to develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214, rapidly. The collaboration includes a broad joint development plan with 20 registrational trials in 9 tumor types and 15,000 patients. 
Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb have announced the planned start of the first 3 registrational trials for NKTR-214 with OPDIVO this year, which will be in first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma and cisplatin-ineligible first-line bladder cancer. 
I'll let Mary talk more about these specific studies in a moment. As you know, we're very excited about the data we continue to collect from the ongoing PIVOT study, and in particular, the translational work that shows that treatment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressers. 
As you'll recall, we observe this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial of NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regimen in many different tumor types. 
As the first example, we're working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
Beyond these first tumor types, the next set of registrational trials in lung, breast, colorectal, gastric and sarcoma cancers are planned to start in the first half of next year. These studies are being designed and informed by the ongoing PIVOT data, which continue to mature over the next 6 to 9 months. 
BMS and Nektar are highly focused on a multipronged clinical development approach for NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. And this will include multiple registrational trials in each tumor type, including first line and relapsed refractory settings. 
The PIVOT trial is ongoing with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO being tested in numerous patient cohorts. Recently, we added several new cohorts that will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO with various doses of YERVOY as well. 
The collaboration with Bristol envisions several paths forward in both the doublet and triplet regimens, and these cohorts will inform our designs of registrational trials. 
In addition to the triplet patient cohorts, we also added to PIVOT a new second line relapse refractory non-small cell lung cancer cohort that reflects a defined patient population based on the evolving standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer. The protocol now includes enrollment of patients who have received single agent anti-PD-1 in either the first or second line, and the second cohort will enroll patients who have received an anti-PD-1 regimen with a platinum doublet in first-line. 
As Mary stated during our recent ASCO presentation, we look forward to presenting new data from the fully enrolled 38 patient first-line melanoma cohort in PIVOT at the upcoming SITC conference in November. 
As data from each of the PIVOT cohorts mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. 
We are also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214 by the end of this year. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, in patients with I-O refractory melanoma. 
We are also actively engaged in discussions with additional companies where there is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of NKTR-214 with other targeted and I-O agents. And we expect that before the end of this year, we will select which of these collaborations will move forward into the clinic. 
We continue to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. Our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TLR-78 agonist, and Nektar-255, an I-O 15 candidate which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. 
In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and 214 has enormous potential. 
Our preclinical data for the combination of these 2 agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, and modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal antitumor response. 
The dose escalation phase of the trial with sequential NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is underway now to determine initial safety, PK and biomarker characterization. 
Following sequential dosing, we will evaluate concurrent dosing for the doublet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214. We will also have the option later in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO. 
We expect to have our first biomarker and safety data from the first patients in the sequential dose escalation phase of the trial sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once we have identified the recommended Phase II dose, the trial is projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NKTR-255, our I-O 15 candidate, we have been conducting important preclinical studies in combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
I-O 15 has been associated with the remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regimens, so we are excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance CAR-T outcomes as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. 
Our preclinical work with CAR-T is progressing nicely, and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year.
Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we stated in the past, the initial data from our ongoing first-in-human Phase I trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels, with no increase in conventional T cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we are extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. 
We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial is advancing very quickly. We expect to present initial data from the Phase I trial, and initial data from the lupus trial at medical meetings in the first half and second half of 2019, respectively. 
We're very excited about the potential of NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune disease and chronic inflammatory indications. 
So I'm very pleased with our results in the first half of 2018, and I'm very proud of our employees for their efforts in executing on our strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mary to discuss the Phase III trials in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer."

I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned, are the first 3 tumor types in which BMS and Nektar are initiating registrational trials by the end of this year. 
Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the standard of care. 
First in melanoma, we're very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, who is the only company to have developed an immuno-oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. 
The Phase III trial of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO will enroll 760 patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma, who will be stratified by PD-L1 status, stage of disease and B-rev status. The primary endpoints are PFS and OS, with a projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open label design into our comparator arm, and we are very excited to initiate this trial. 
This typical study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO as the first-line I-O standard of care. The Phase III trial design will be available on clinicaltrials.gov shortly and enrollment should begin within the next month. 
In renal cell carcinoma, Bristol-Myers and Nektar are planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO, and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO and YERVOY across multiple early and later stage settings. These trial designs will be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registrational program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Since ASCO, we have enrolled additional patients into the first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer cohort in PIVOT. And the ORR continues to be consistent in this patient population. 
As you know, this is a patient population with a very high unmet need, particularly for individuals who have tumors with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline, and for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. 
With this in mind, we have several potential trial designs in bladder cancer, including ones that focus on this underserved patient population. We will review our program with regulatory agencies shortly so that we can be ready to initiate our first registrational trial in bladder cancer by year-end. 
As Howard stated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. 
TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In preclinical mouse tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and increase levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. 
Since NKTR-214 does not target these myeloid cell populations, it provides a unique, nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. 
As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who are relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect the first data from this trial towards the end of 2019. 
With Syndax, we are in the process of designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214 with entinostat in patients with I-O relapsed or refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the study design before the end of this year. 
With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of Nektar's second quarter 2018 revenue, and then I will give an update to our annual financial guidance to incorporate our final accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration, which closed in the second quarter.
We ended the second quarter with $2.106 billion of cash and investments. At the closing of the strategic collaboration with BMS on April 3, we received $1.85 billion, which includes a $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium equity investment. 
We recorded the equity investment at fair value on the April 3 closing date, estimated to be $790 million, which reflected the price of our stock on the closing date and a discount for the unregistered status of the shares issued to BMS. This resulted in $790 million being recorded as additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $1.06 billion being recorded as revenue in Q2, based on our GAAP revenue accounting conclusions regarding the units of accounting in the collaboration arrangement and the allocation of value to those units. 
Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our annual financial guidance remains unchanged other than incorporating our final GAAP revenue accounting conclusions for the BMS collaboration transaction. 
Our full year revenue guidance of $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS payments, and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalty and other revenue. 
We expect the remaining $40 million to $50 million in our full year revenue guidance to be recognized ratably over the last 2 quarters of 2018. 
Our GAAP expense guidance is unchanged. We anticipate 2018 GAAP R&D expense will range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. 
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We still expect to end the year with a cash position of between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.
And with that, I will open the call for questions. Operator?"

And we do believe there are opportunities in all three of the segments, although the clinical trials may not look the exact same for each one of those patient populations. In addition, after the release of the KEYNOTE-189 data, we think there is a very important opportunity for those patients who have actually either relapsed or are refractory to a frontline I-O agent and we also are pursuing a second line strategy that is both embedded into our PIVOT-02 study as well as randomized placebo -- randomized controlled studies. Third, we also believe that there is an opportunity for those patients who have unresectable stage III lung cancer and would go on to an I-O regimen such as durvalumab and so we are looking also at an opportunity in stage III patients. And then fourth, we also are looking at designing trials for those patients who have early-stage lung cancer that is resectable. And so we were moving forward with a broad strategy and those are some of the possibilities, not all of them, but some of the possibilities that are top of our mind."

And moving forward, we're going to do just as you were talking about, is present either by individual cohorts at distinct meetings. So this means that over the course of 6 to 18 months when we have sufficient maturity of the data, we are very thoughtfully planning with BMS where to present the lung data, as you mentioned as well as all of the other cohorts to highlight our results. And remember, one of our primary goals is going to be to educate the medical oncology community who are going to be participating in our 20 registrational trials. So while some of the presentations are going to be at the large general oncology conferences such as ASCO or SITC, we also are planning presenting at more tumor-specific focused symposiums where we could capture a large audience, such as the thoracic oncology community. Remember that PIVOT data is maturing at different rates and I think you are very well aware in a cohort like first-line RCC, the response rate has increased over time and so the maturation of the data in RCC could be very different than, say, what we're seeing in urothelial cancer where we showed you a very rapid response to the doublet treatment with 6 out of 10 patients having objective response, which we presented at ASCO. So Howard made it very clear today too that at SITC we'll be providing a full update on our first-line melanoma cohorts that includes 38 patients at SITC this year. And those patients will all have had a 6-month follow-up at the time of our presentation."

In PIVOT-02, we have 2 relapsed refractory cohorts, one that would allow those patients who had a single agent checkpoint inhibitor in frontline as well as patients who had a chemotherapy doublet, then went on a single agent checkpoint inhibitor. So we actually have one cohort that allows second or third line patients, and then we have a cohort that could serve potentially as an accelerated approval cohort of patients who just failed chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in the first-line, and then those would be second line relapse refractory patients. Going back to the same question that Chris asked, is when will we have data? We really are going to be transparent once we have mature data, and are going to be presenting data at a scientific conference. Today, Howard's made it really clear that we're going to be at SITC as we promised, at ASCO showing the first-line melanoma data and then the 6-month follow-up data really is a general sense of when we believe data will be mature. Obviously, some data may be mature more quickly and in the relapse refractory setting we may see it takes a little bit longer for patients to respond to treatment. We also will always ask you to keep in mind we see deepening of responses over time as we follow patients and we also see increased number of patients who respond as we go over time and just in RCC alone, we've seen 1 patient on the fifth scan convert from stable disease to a responder. So we do know that in certain tumor types, it's going to take longer for the data to mature and in other tumor types it will be more quickly. As we make a decision on the presenting the data, we will ensure that our investors and our scientific community are aware of that."

Yes, so Bert, one of the key things that we did in this trial is we made sure that in both our blood-based collections and tumor-based collections, we could delineate the mechanism of NKTR-262 as it engages the TLR-78 pathway. And then in addition, see how that delineation stacks against the NKTR-214 specific sets of immune activation. So in the tumor and in the blood, we have a number of biomarkers that detect type one interferon activity. And so that's associated with the kind of interferon signaling pathway that, that TLR engages. So we can detect that both in the tumor and in the blood in terms of both molecular biomarkers such as gene expression. But then also changes at the protein and cellular level because the TLR engages different cell populations than does NKTR-214. So those 2 sets of biomarkers specific to 262 and specific to 214 are very important. We use them together. They'll show us the differentiation of this combination from NKTR-214 alone, for example. And it will also just really inform the types of tumors and the way we would use the combination going forward."

Now to get there, of course we need to review our strategic strategy with the FDA and with health authorities and we are moving rapidly to do that in order to launch our Pivotal trials by the end of this year. Likewise, as you heard today that the melanoma primary efficacy endpoint is projected for 22 months after the first patient is in. We also have always said that in PIVOT-02, we have potential of potential to convert that study into a registrational study for a patient population with a high unmet medical need. And certainly, those patients who receive a checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer would also qualify for high unmet medical need as they relapse from that combination. There are also others, like a third line urothelial carcinoma population or relapsed refractory melanoma population. So we have always created a strategy that would allow us to leverage data quickly from the PIVOT-02 study to launch into definitive Phase III studies as well as potentially move any of those cohorts into a rapid accelerated approval pathway. And we have had those conversations with the FDA which allows us to convert the PIVOT-02 into a registrational study and so as we move forward, we believe that while the melanoma study will have a read out in 22 months, there are other opportunities for potential accelerated approval."

We will host a call on a Saturday morning at 9 a.m, following the oral presentation of updated efficacy safety and bio market data of the evening before.
On the call, we will represent the data from the previous evenings oral session. Dr. Harriet Kluger of Wilkinson cancer center [indiscernible] cancer center will join us to review Dr. [indiscernible] presentation and discuss our Phase III trials in melanoma patients, which is underway. In addition, we will also be presenting early data from the first patients in the REVEAL trial evaluating NKTR-262 plus NKTR-214. As we stated last quarter, as data from each of the PIVOT cohorts and other tumor tpes mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. We are currently planning the next presentation of Pivot data from our data cancer cohort at the upcoming ASCO do you meeting in February of 2019. We continue to be very excited about the data being generated in the PIVOT trial and the future potential of NKTR-214 as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology.
I'll start today by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved our for our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas, immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. So first, let me cover NKTR-181. We will recognize the severe opioid epidemic that is facing our country right now. One significant building blocks to addressing this crisis is providing new pain medications tha don't get the same profile as they use existing opioid medications on the market. We continue to work closely with the FDA during the review of Nektar 181 as we have done throughout its development and as a reminder, our PDUFA date is May 29, and we currently understand the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. However, we have not been given a date for this meeting yet. As I stated last quarter, we are in the process of establishing a separate commercial subsidiary with one and more capital partners to launch this important molecule. We believe this will allow us to ensure the commercial launch of NKTR-181 is optimized, and we continue to be very excited about the future for NKTR-181. 
Now let's talk about immuno-oncology. We remained focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. With this year's collaboration for NKTR-214 with the Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. The Bristol-Myers collaboration gives us a unique and broad platform for us to rapidly develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214. 
As a reminder, the collaboration includes a broad joint-development plan with 20 registrational trials across multiple tumor types.
From the start of this collaboration, we've talked about the scope and scale of this development program, and I'm pleased to share with you today that the first 8 of these 20 trials and our joint development plan has been initiated or being initiated shortly. As you know, our Phase III melanoma trial is already underway, and we dosed our first patients in September. For RCC and bladder cancers, BMS and Nektar are initiating a total of 3 registrational trials in each tumor setting, 3 in the first-line RCC setting and 3 in the first line bladder cancer setting. As the start of our lung cancer registrational work, BMS and Nektar have added a newly-defined cohort of approximately 100 second line non-small cell cancer patients to the ongoing PIVOT trial. This is designed to provide us with a potential pathway to registration in this new patient population.
You will see these additional trials begin to be posted externally on clinical trial.gov of that one of our coming months and I'll let Mary share more about these 8 study designs and patient populations in a moment. In addition, BMS and Nektar are currently working on the design for the next wave of trials in the joint development plan, so these can be initiated in the first half of next year. 
The BMS collaboration is exceptionally important to the development of NKTR-214 with OPDIVO in multiple tumor types. Recognizing that Nektar 214 is a broad-based mechanism as we told you in the past, we have always planned to collaborate with additional strategic partners to allow us to combine NKTR-214 with the anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents in tumor types that are not within the BMS joint development plan. We had substantial interest on companies that recognize the importance of the unique mechanism of NKTR-214 and immunoncology, and that is one of the most promising I-O agents in development based on the large party of preclinical and clinical data we've generated for these agent.
To this end, yesterday, we announced an exciting new clinical collaboration with Pfizer to develop new NKTR-214 with several agents in their portfolio in 2 new tumor types. The collaboration reported development of NKTR 214 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer andis, cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Under the new agreement, pfizer will develop various doublet and tablet corporations NKTR-214 and Pfizer and anti-PD-L1 agent of Willamette, Pfizer's part in April collaborate and Pfizer and [indiscernible] antigen agent and [indiscernible]. We've worked -- we've enjoyed working very closely with the talented team at Pfizer [indiscernible] to design this important clinical program produced for patients publishing with a high unmet need. Pfizer will be running the clinical work, and we'll serve as the sponsor of this trial. And later Mary will serve the maximum resolution of the multiple clinical study and prostate and head and neck cancer. We're also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214, which you will see on clinical trial.gov within the next several months. The first will be a phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 Takeda's dual object known as TAK-659, in patients with known heart can lymphoma. That scheduled to start with the first part of next year. The second will be a phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax 6 HDAC inhibitor in patients with I-O over [indiscernible] , which is also plan to start in the first part of next year. In addition, over the last several months, we've entered into new clinical collaborations with 2 new partners, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] both of which will include clinical trials with unique mechanisms in combination with NKTR-214. For IMVEXXY, we will combine NKTR-214 with their personalized new antigen cancer vaccine. [indiscernible] and Nektar are collaborating on the combination of NKTR-214 with their small molecule immunomodulators, a combination [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] inhibitor, which checkpoint inhibitor in patients with pancreatic cancer. We plan to initiate these trials in the first half of 2019.
As you know, our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TIO agonist and NKTR 255 and I-O 15 candidate, which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR 262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR 262 and NKTR 214 has enormous potential. Our preclinical data for the combination of these 2 agents demonstrates clearly having individual agents NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 work together to engage the [indiscernible] and adaptive arm of the immune system, control [indiscernible] and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. And most importantly, modify systemic immunology to drive Scoble in fact tumor response in tumor models. The dose escalation phase of the trial with NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is continuing to determine initial safety, efficacy, PK and biomarker characterization. We will also have the later option in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus [indiscernible]. As I stated goal, we plan to share some of the early clinical data from this trial this weekend at Citi. Once we've identified the recommended phase II dose, the trials projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For Nektar-255, our I-O 15 candidate, we've been conducting preclinical studies evaluating NKTR and end consumers driven by NK cells expansion and activation. NKTR is a powerful agonist that allows us to modify [indiscernible] biology for the treatment of hematological [indiscernible] in combination with targeted antibody mechanisms. We plan to file an IND for NKTR 255 in the first half of next year. 
In another application, we've been evaluating NKTR 255 with combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the recognition cancer center. High levels of native I-O 15 has been associated with the remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regiments. So we're excited about the potential of NKTR 255 to greatly enhance CAR-T incomes as well as potential to be we can other mechanisms in I-O. Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from the ongoing first in human Phase IA trial it went well with NKTR 358 it's healthy volunteers, has shown dose dependent router in T regulatory cell with no increase in conventional T cells or in K cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we're extremely pleased of this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. We expect to present complete data from the Phase IA trial at medical meetings in the first half of 2019. We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus, the trial is advancing very quickly and we're very excited about the potential for NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic, inflammatory conditions.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Mary to review additional details on the clinical work plan with Pfizer and head and neck prostate cancer and the Phase III trials in melanoma, RCC and bladder cancer with BMS."

One will be a Phase II cohort to evaluate NKTR-214 plus [indiscernible] in patient with regard to renal cell carcinoma of head and neck have not received any prior systemic treatment for [indiscernible] disease. Enrollment will include patients with both PD-L1 negative anti-PD-L1 a positive baseline tumors. The second and third cohorts of the study future Phase Ib dose escalation followed by Phase II component to evaluate NKTR 214 plus [indiscernible], combined with either suburb and more [indiscernible] and patients with metastatic CRPC who have progress on one or more prior regiments. Pfizer and Nektar are finalizing the political we plan to start the clinical trial in 2019. Cohorts will include 20 to 40 patients, and we will measure clinical success on the specific combinations and reference outcomes in a very settings been investigated in this study. Now I'll I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned are the first 3 tumor types, which BMS and Nektar for lunch our registrational trials. I'll also talk about the pivot expansion and second non-Small lung cancer, which is currently underway. Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus [indiscernible] as the standard of care. To that end, we are initiating 3 separate studies in renal cell carcinoma, 3 separate studies in bladder cancer, and we continue to advance our registrational clinical development strategy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. First in melanoma, we are very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, the only company to have developed an immuno oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. We are interlinked 760 patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma into our Phase III trial with NKTR-214 plus or Devo. Patients will be stratified by [indiscernible] status stage of disease and B-rev. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival with the projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open-label study design and to our comparator arm. This pivotal study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR 214 plus [indiscernible] as the first-line I-O standard of care, and we are very excited patient dosing is underway. For more details the Phase III trials is available on clinicaltrials.gov. In real cell carcinoma, crystal and Nektar are planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advance patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTRNKTR-214 plus OPDIVO and NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO in this indication. 
The first Phase III trial in first line prostatic RCC patients will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO versus a TKI of physician's choice either McNabb or [indiscernible] and approximately 600 patients with intermediate or poor risk RCC. This trial design is available on clinicaltrials.gov as well. Patients will be randomized 1 to, and will be stratified in the trial based upon multiple factors, including PD-L1 status, IMDC prognostic score and choice of PTI. The study will look at overall survival and has an estimated time to the first interim analysis of survival of 27 months, currently forecasted to read out by the first quarter of 2021. The second Phase III trial in RCC who will evaluate NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO and YERVOY as compared OPDIVO and YERVOY and patients with previously untreated metastatic RCC. This study will enroll approximately 800 patients with intermediate or poor IMDC scores and will also stratify by PD-L1 status.
The third registrational trial in RCC will be a TKI inclusive regiment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO compared to our people closer together with patients with metastatic and untreated accessory with glacial component and all IMDC risk levels. This study will include a safety readings to determine combination dose for the second part of the study, which will then evaluate ORR, PPS and overall survival. As you know, we've demonstrated that treatment with NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressers. We also observe this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first phase I trial with NKTR-214. This is why if we believe that NKTR-214 plus OPDIVO can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regiment in many different tumor types. As the first example, we are working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registrational program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and others settings. This ineligible bladder cancer patients are population with a very high unmet need, particularly those with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. With this in mind, our first trial in bladder cancer will be flattened patients and we'll focus on patients with baseline PD-L1 negative disease. We are currently finalizing the design of this study with input from the FDA. The trial will enroll over a 150 patients, and we are planning to include a chemotherapy comparative reference arm into the study. You will see this trial design posted on clinicaltrials.gov within the next month. The second Phase III trial on bladder cancer is planned to start in January 2019, and will be conducted in patients with newly diagnosed muscle invasive bladder cancer. The third trial in metastatic bladder cancer will be in the first-line metastatic patient population who are both fade eligible and ineligible. As Howard stated earlier, we are expanding the second line relapse non-small cell lung cancer cohort in pivot to enroll approximately 100 patients who receive a checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first-line. The original design of pivot envision that in expansion arm in an appropriate patient publishing could potentially serve as a partial registrational pathway is population, which has limited options once rare disease progressed following checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first line.
As Howard stated, BMS and Nektar are highly focused on continuing to advance our broad joint development plan. And to that end, we are now designing the next wave of clinical trials beyond the age that I just reviewed. As Howard also communicated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with [indiscernible] dualx inhibitor TAK-659 into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Tech Data that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In preclinical met tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived customer sales and increase the level of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor-micro environment. Since NKTR-214 and TAK-659 target different cell populations, the 2 compounds provide a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting this study provides a strategic opportunity for us. That trial will enroll patients to over relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapies, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect this trial to start in the first part of 2019. With syndex, we are missing the first combination trial of NKTR-214  with the [indiscernible] in patients with our you relapse refractory [indiscernible], and we expect to finalize the design before the end of this year with first patient dossed in early 2019. With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call over to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of highlights Nektar's third quarter of 2018 financial results and then I will review our 2018 financial guidance.
We ended the third quarter with $2 billion of cash and investments. Total revenue was $27.8 million for the quarter and $1.15 billion for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $152.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. And $212.2 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. This significant increase in 2018 revenue as a result of the consumers with collaboration that we closed last quarter. R&D expense came in at $102.9 million in Q3 and [ $290.7 million ] for the first 9 months of 2018 as compared to $65.7 million for the third quarter of 201, and $187 million for the first 9 months of 2017. We expect our R&D expense to increase as we continue to execute on the registrational joint development plan with BMS over the coming months. In addition, we will be initiating multiple trials combining NKTR-214 with other synergistic mechanisms in various cancer settings, including trials with Tech Data, Syndax, IXL, flexibility, and our trial with Pfizer in multiple tumor types. It is important to keep in mind that our annual R&D funding obligations with Bristow is subject to $125 million annual funding GAAP. This GAAP will not limit our aggregate annual GAAP R&D expense recognition, but will limit our annual cash expanding obligation to $125 million prior to the commercialization of NKTR-214. We recognized a net loss of $96.1 million for the quarter, and net income of $779.5 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to net income of $60.9 million for the third quarter of 2017, and a net loss of $62.9 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our financial guidance is unchanged. Our full-year revenue guidance remains at $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion, which includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS upfront collaboration payment and a portion of the equity investment and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalties and other revenues. Our GAAP expense guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2018 R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense.
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We continue to estimate that will end 2018 with a cash position between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.

And then from those earliest discussion, we went into a very substantial preclinical program where we studied 2 mechanism in a range of different multicentric tumor models. To address how the underlying mechanisms of each drug work together. And where the synergy might come from when the 2 are dosed together into the same immune system. And one of the things that we discovered was a very high proportion of what we call a hydrostatic or effector cells. That we detected into the tumor microenvironment when both drugs were those together. To this mean specifically immune cells that were very high and like where [indiscernible], in a similar kinds of effects of cytokines. And so that policy emphasis to the end look into particular that relapse refractory setting. Because those kind of cells are expressly. the kind of cells certain kind of resistance mechanisms.

On today's call, we will review our accomplishment in 2018 to date and also our planned milestones over the coming months, including the initiation of the broad registration program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials during this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers as well as the new expansion arm in PIVOT enrolling second-line non-small cell lung cancer patients. We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018.
As you know, we're planning to presenting data at this weekend's SITC meeting in Washington, D.C. for Stage IV melanoma patients being treated with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo from the PIVOT study. The presentation will include a number of important metrics, including depths of responses over time as well as the complete response rate and disease control rate for the population. We will host a call on Saturday morning at 9 a.m following the oral presentation of updated efficacy safety and bio market data of the evening before.
On the call, we will re-present the data from the previous evening's oral session. Dr. Harriet Kluger of the Yale Cancer Center and Dr. Adi Diab of MD Anderson Cancer Center will join us to review Dr. Diab's presentation and discuss our Phase III trial in melanoma patients, which is underway. In addition, we will also be presenting early data from the first patients in the REVEAL trial evaluating NKTR-262 plus NKTR-214. As we stated last quarter, as data from each of the PIVOT cohorts and other tumor types mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. We are currently planning the next presentation of PIVOT data from our bladder cancer cohort at the upcoming ASCO GU meeting in February of 2019. We continue to be very excited about the data being generated in the PIVOT trial and the future potential of NKTR-214 as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology.
I'll start today by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved over our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas, immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. So first, let me cover NKTR-181. We all recognize the severe opioid epidemic that is facing our country right now. One significant building block to addressing this crisis is providing new pain medications that don't carry the same profile as the existing opioid medications on the market. We continue to work closely with the FDA during the review of NKTR-181 as we have done throughout its development. And as a reminder, our PDUFA date is May 29, and we currently understand the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. However, we have not been given a date for this meeting yet. As I stated last quarter, we are in the process of establishing a separate commercial subsidiary with one or more capital partners to launch this important molecule. We believe this will allow us to ensure the commercial launch of NKTR-181 is optimized, and we continue to be very excited about the future for NKTR-181. 
Now let's talk about immuno-oncology. We remained focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. With this year's collaboration for NKTR-214 with the Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. The Bristol-Myers collaboration gives us a unique and broad platform for us to rapidly develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214. 
As a reminder, the collaboration includes a broad joint-development plan with 20 registrational trials across multiple tumor types.
From the start of this collaboration, we've talked about the scope and scale of this development program, and I'm pleased to share with you today that the first 8 of these 20 trials in our joint development plan have been initiated or are being initiated shortly. As you know, our Phase III melanoma trial is already underway, and we dosed our first patients in September. For RCC and bladder cancers, BMS and Nektar are initiating a total of 3 registrational trials in each tumor setting, 3 in the first-line RCC setting and 3 in the first-line bladder cancer setting. As the start of our lung cancer registrational work, BMS and Nektar have added a newly-defined cohort of approximately 100 second-line non-small cell cancer patients to the ongoing PIVOT trial. This is designed to provide us with a potential pathway to registration in this new patient population.
You will see these additional trials begin to be posted externally on clinicaltrials.gov over the coming months and I'll let Mary share more about these 8 study designs and patient populations in a moment. In addition, BMS and Nektar are currently working on the designs for the next wave of trials in the joint development plan, so these can be initiated in the first half of next year. 
The BMS collaboration is exceptionally important to the development of NKTR-214 with Opdivo in multiple tumor types. Recognizing that NKTR-214 is a broad-based mechanism as we told you in the past, we have always planned to collaborate with additional strategic partners to allow us to combine NKTR-214 with other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents in tumor types that are not within the BMS joint development plan. We have substantial interest from companies that recognize the importance of the unique mechanism of NKTR-214 in immuno-oncology, and that is one of the most promising I-O agents in development based on the large body of preclinical and clinical data we've generated for this agent.
To this end, yesterday, we announced an exciting new clinical collaboration with Pfizer to develop new -- NKTR-214 with several agents in their portfolio in 2 new tumor types. The collaboration will pursue development of NKTR-214 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Under the new agreement, Pfizer will develop various doublet and triplet combinations with NKTR-214 and Pfizer and Merck Serono's anti-PD-L1 agent avelumab; Pfizer's PARP inhibitor, talazoparib; and Pfizer and Astellas' anti-androgen agent, enzalutamide. We've worked -- we've enjoyed working very closely with the talented team at Pfizer Oncology to design this important clinical program for these patient populations with a high unmet need. Pfizer will be running the clinical work and will serve as the sponsor of this trial. And later, Mary will summarize the design of the multiple-arm clinical study in prostate and head and neck cancer. We're also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214, which you will see on clinicaltrials.gov within the next several months. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 Takeda's dual SYK-FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659, in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. That is scheduled to start in the first part of next year. The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor in patients with IO refractory melanoma , which is also planned to start in the first part of next year. In addition, over the last several months, we've entered into new clinical collaborations with 2 new partners, Vaccibody and BioXcel, both of which will include clinical trials with unique mechanisms in combination with NKTR-214. For Vaccibody, we will combine NKTR-214 with their personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine. BioXcel and Nektar are collaborating on the combination of NKTR-214 with their small molecule immunomodulator, a combination DPP 8/9 and FAP inhibitor, and a checkpoint inhibitor in patients with pancreatic cancer. We plan to initiate these trials in the first half of 2019.
As you know, our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TLR 7/8 agonist; and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 has enormous potential. Our preclinical data for the combination of these 2 agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. And most importantly, modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal anti-tumor response in tumor models. The dose escalation phase of the trial with NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is continuing to determine initial safety, efficacy, PK and biomarker characterization. We will also have the later option in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. As I stated earlier, we plan to share some of the early clinical data from this trial this weekend at SITC. Once we've identified the recommended phase II dose, the trial is projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NKTR-255, our IL-15 candidate, we've been conducting preclinical studies evaluating NKTR-255 in oncology models driven by NK cell expansion and activation. NKTR-255 is a powerful agonist that allows us to modify NK biology for the treatment of hematological malignancies in combination with targeted antibody mechanisms. We plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year. 
In another application, we've been evaluating NKTR-255 in combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. High levels of native IL-15 has been associated with remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regimens. So we're excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance CAR-T incomes as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from the ongoing first-in-human Phase IA trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T-cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we're extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. We expect to present complete data from the Phase IA trial at a medical meeting in the first half of 2019. We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial is advancing very quickly and we're very excited about the potential for NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic, inflammatory conditions.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Mary to review additional details on the clinical work plan with Pfizer in head and neck prostate cancers and the Phase III trials in melanoma, RCC and bladder cancer with BMS."

Let me first start with reviewing the clinical plans with Pfizer in prostate and head and neck cancer.

Let me first start with reviewing the clinical plans with Pfizer in prostate and head and neck cancer. We are very excited to be working with Pfizer oncology to explore the potential of combining multiple mechanisms in 2 new solid tumor settings. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death for American men. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is an incurable disease with a very poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate under 30%. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck tends to be diagnosed very late and also has a poor prognosis. Under the new clinical collaboration, Pfizer oncology will conduct and sponsor a trial with multiple arms evaluating NKTR-214, Pfizer and Merck Serono's anti-PD-L1 agent avelumab; Pfizer's PARP inhibitor, talazoparib; and Pfizer and Astellas' androgen receptor inhibitor, enzalutamide. The planned Phase Ib/II clinical trial will include multiple patient arms. One will be a Phase II cohort to evaluate NKTR-214 plus avelumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have not received any prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Enrollment will include patients with both PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive baseline tumors. The second and third cohorts of the study will feature one Phase Ib dose escalation followed by a Phase II component to evaluate NKTR-214 plus avelumab, combined with either talazoparib or with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on one or more prior regimens. Pfizer and Nektar are finalizing the protocol and we plan to start the clinical trial in 2019. Cohorts will include 20 to 40 patients, and we will measure clinical success based on the specific combinations and reference outcomes in the various settings being investigated in the study. Now I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned are the first 3 tumor types in which BMS and Nektar will launch our registrational trials. I'll also talk about the PIVOT expansion in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, which is currently underway. Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus Opdivo as the standard of care. To that end, we are initiating 3 separate studies in renal cell carcinoma, 3 separate studies in bladder cancer, and we continue to advance our registrational clinical development strategy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. First in melanoma, we are very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, the only company to have developed an immuno oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. We are enrolling 760 patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma into our Phase III trial or NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. Patients will be stratified by PD-L1 status, stage of disease and BRAF. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival with the projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open-label study design and to our comparator arm. This pivotal study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus Opdivo as the first-line I-O standard of care, and we are very excited patient dosing is underway. For more details, the Phase III trial design is available on clinicaltrials.gov. In renal cell carcinoma, Bristol and Nektar are planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advanced patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and Yervoy in this indication. 
The first Phase III trial in first-line metastatic RCC patients will evaluate NKTR-214 plus Opdivo versus a TKI of physician's choice -- either sunitinib or cabozantinib in approximately 600 patients with intermediate or poor risk RCC. This trial design is available on clinicaltrials.gov as well. Patients will be randomized 1 to 1, and will be stratified in the trial based upon multiple factors, including PD-L1 status, IMDC prognostic score and choice of TKI. The study will look at overall survival and has an estimated time to the first interim analysis of survival of 27 months, currently forecasted to read out by the first quarter of 2021. The second Phase III trial in RCC will evaluate NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Yervoy as compared Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with previously untreated metastatic RCC. The study will enroll approximately 800 patients with intermediate or poor risk IMDC scores and will also stratify by PD-L1 status.
The third registrational trial in RCC will be a TKI inclusive regimen with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and a TKI compared to Nivo plus a TKI in patients with metastatic untreated RCC with clear cell component and all IMDC risk levels. The study will include a safety lead-in to determine the TKI combination dose for the second part of the study, which will then evaluate ORR, PFS and overall survival. As you know, we've demonstrated that treatment with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressors. We also observed this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial with NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus Opdivo can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regimen in many different tumor types. As the first example, we are working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registrational program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Cis-ineligible bladder cancer patients are a population with a very high unmet need, particularly those with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. With this in mind, our first trial in bladder cancer will be in cisplatin-ineligible patients and will focus on patients with baseline PD-L1 negative disease. We are currently finalizing the design of this study with input from the FDA. The trial will enroll over 150 patients and we are planning to include a chemotherapy comparative reference arm into the study. You will see this trial design posted on clinicaltrials.gov within the next month. The second Phase III trial on bladder cancer is planned to start in January 2019, and will be conducted in patients with newly diagnosed muscle invasive bladder cancer. The third trial in metastatic bladder cancer will be in the first-line metastatic patient population who are both cis-eligible and cis-ineligible. As Howard stated earlier, we are expanding the second-line relapse non-small cell lung cancer cohort in PIVOT to enroll approximately 100 patients who received a checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first-line. The original design of PIVOT envisions that an expansion arm in an appropriate patient population could potentially serve as a faster registrational pathway in this population which has limited options once their disease has progressed following a checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first-line.
As Howard stated, BMS and Nektar are highly focused on continuing to advance our broad joint development plan. And to that end, we are now designing the next wave of clinical trials beyond the 8 that I just reviewed. As Howard also communicated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual  SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In preclinical mass tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Since NKTR-214 and TAK-659 target different cell populations, the 2 compounds provide a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who are relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect this trial to start in the first part of 2019. With Syndax, we are designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214  with entinostat in patients with IO relapse refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the design before the end of this year with first patients dosed in early 2019. With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call over to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of highlights from Nektar's third quarter of 2018 financial results and then I will review our 2018 financial guidance.We ended the third quarter with $2 billion of cash and",459,"Thank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a brief review of highlights from Nektar's third quarter of 2018 financial results and then I will review our 2018 financial guidance.
We ended the third quarter with $2 billion of cash and investments. Total revenue was $27.8 million for the quarter and $1.15 billion for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $152.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. And $212.2 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. This significant increase in 2018 revenue is a result of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration that we closed last quarter. R&D expense came in at $102.9 million in Q3 and $290.7 million for the first 9 months of 2018 as compared to $65.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $187 million for the first 9 months of 2017. We expect our R&D expense to increase as we continue to execute on the registrational joint development plan with BMS over the coming months. In addition, we will be initiating multiple trials combining NKTR-214 with other synergistic mechanisms in various cancer settings, including trials with Takeda, Syndax, BioXcel, Vaccibody, and our trial with Pfizer in multiple tumor types. It is important to keep in mind that our annual R&D funding obligation with Bristol is subject to $125 million annual funding cap. This cap will not limit our aggregate annual GAAP R&D expense recognition, but will limit our annual cash funding obligation to $125 million prior to the commercialization of NKTR-214. We recognized a net loss of $96.1 million for the quarter, and net income of $779.5 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018. As compared to net income of $60.9 million for the third quarter of 2017, and a net loss of $62.9 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our financial guidance is unchanged. Our full-year revenue guidance remains at $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion, which includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS upfront collaboration payment and a portion of the equity investment and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalties and other revenues. Our GAAP expense guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2018 R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense.
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We continue to estimate that we will end 2018 with a cash position between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.

So to address the first part of your question, in PIVOT-02 we did -- we have a cohort that is second and third line non-small-cell lung cancer patients. As you know, when we saw you at ASCO this year, we did present 3 cases from that cohort and Dr. Gettinger walked through that these patients had been previously treated both with chemotherapy and at least one prior checkpoint inhibitor. Based on the early data that we saw in that cohort, we did go and have a discussion with the FDA about starting a new cohort in non-Small cell lung cancer patients that are relapsed to a checkpoint inhibitor in chemotherapy, the same regimen administered in KEYNOTE-189. Through that discussion with the FDA, this new cohort now includes 100 patients that just it's the second line -- not second and third line as our original cohort was. And we just began enrolling to this cohort: first patient is already in and we anticipate enrolling this cohort over the next 12 months. We then follow these patients for roughly 6 months, and at that time have data to potentially present to the FDA. To address your second question about randomized trial, as both Howard and I mentioned, we are in the process of developing the next wave of clinical trials, and we do have plans for going in randomized trials both in the early setting of non-small cell lung cancer as well as later setting.

So we definitely were very aware of the data with high-dose IL-2 and entinostat in renal cell carcinoma. That was actually one of the reasons that started our initial collaboration with Syndax altogether. And then from those earliest discussions, we went into a very substantial preclinical program where we studied the 2 mechanisms in a range of different mouse and genetic tumor models to address how the underlying mechanisms of each drug work together. And where the synergy might come from when the 2 are dosed together into the same immune system. And one of the things that we discovered was a very high proportion of what we call high cytokine effector cells, that we detected into the tumor microenvironment when both drugs were dosed together. So this means specifically immune cells that were very high in like interferon gamma, TNF, and other kinds of kinds of effector cytokines. And so that was the impetus to then look into, in particular, the relapse refractory setting. Because those kind of cells are expressly the kind of cells that can overcome certain kind of resistance mechanisms. So then targeting the relapse refractory melanoma setting became a very attractive utilization of the 2 molecules. And this is why we prioritized that tumor type into the clinical trial."

And so there, we are rolling relapse refractory patients across a range of different tumor types. And so we are very pleased that we will be presenting some of the early results of that trial. Also coming up later this weekend. What we are able to see is how the mechanism of intertumoral administration of NKTR-262 can really impact the innate immune system, draw innate immune cells into the tumor and then, in combination with NKTR-214, can drive systemic immune responses.

We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018.
As you know, we're planning to presenting data at this weekend's SITC meeting in Washington, D.C. for Stage IV melanoma patients being treated with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo from the PIVOT study. The presentation will include a number of important metrics, including depths of responses over time as well as the complete response rate and disease control rate for the population. We will host a call on Saturday morning at 9 a.m following the oral presentation of updated efficacy safety and bio market data of the evening before.
On the call, we will re-present the data from the previous evening's oral session. Dr. Harriet Kluger of the Yale Cancer Center and Dr. Adi Diab of MD Anderson Cancer Center will join us to review Dr. Diab's presentation and discuss our Phase III trial in melanoma patients, which is underway. In addition, we will also be presenting early data from the first patients in the REVEAL trial evaluating NKTR-262 plus NKTR-214. As we stated last quarter, as data from each of the PIVOT cohorts and other tumor types mature over the next 6 to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the data sets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. We are currently planning the next presentation of PIVOT data from our bladder cancer cohort at the upcoming ASCO GU meeting in February of 2019. We continue to be very excited about the data being generated in the PIVOT trial and the future potential of NKTR-214 as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology.
I'll start today by reviewing the multiple successes we have achieved over our pipeline of Nektar invented medicines across 3 therapeutic areas, immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. So first, let me cover NKTR-181. We all recognize the severe opioid epidemic that is facing our country right now. One significant building block to addressing this crisis is providing new pain medications that don't carry the same profile as the existing opioid medications on the market. We continue to work closely with the FDA during the review of NKTR-181 as we have done throughout its development. And as a reminder, our PDUFA date is May 29, and we currently understand the FDA plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to review our NDA. However, we have not been given a date for this meeting yet. As I stated last quarter, we are in the process of establishing a separate commercial subsidiary with one or more capital partners to launch this important molecule. We believe this will allow us to ensure the commercial launch of NKTR-181 is optimized, and we continue to be very excited about the future for NKTR-181. 
Now let's talk about immuno-oncology. We remained focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that address the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. With this year's collaboration for NKTR-214 with the Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are now in an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. The Bristol-Myers collaboration gives us a unique and broad platform for us to rapidly develop our lead I-O candidate, NKTR-214. 
As a reminder, the collaboration includes a broad joint-development plan with 20 registrational trials across multiple tumor types.
From the start of this collaboration, we've talked about the scope and scale of this development program, and I'm pleased to share with you today that the first 8 of these 20 trials in our joint development plan have been initiated or are being initiated shortly. As you know, our Phase III melanoma trial is already underway, and we dosed our first patients in September. For RCC and bladder cancers, BMS and Nektar are initiating a total of 3 registrational trials in each tumor setting, 3 in the first-line RCC setting and 3 in the first-line bladder cancer setting. As the start of our lung cancer registrational work, BMS and Nektar have added a newly-defined cohort of approximately 100 second-line non-small cell cancer patients to the ongoing PIVOT trial. This is designed to provide us with a potential pathway to registration in this new patient population.
You will see these additional trials begin to be posted externally on clinicaltrials.gov over the coming months and I'll let Mary share more about these 8 study designs and patient populations in a moment. In addition, BMS and Nektar are currently working on the designs for the next wave of trials in the joint development plan, so these can be initiated in the first half of next year. 
The BMS collaboration is exceptionally important to the development of NKTR-214 with Opdivo in multiple tumor types. Recognizing that NKTR-214 is a broad-based mechanism as we told you in the past, we have always planned to collaborate with additional strategic partners to allow us to combine NKTR-214 with other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents in tumor types that are not within the BMS joint development plan. We have substantial interest from companies that recognize the importance of the unique mechanism of NKTR-214 in immuno-oncology, and that is one of the most promising I-O agents in development based on the large body of preclinical and clinical data we've generated for this agent.
To this end, yesterday, we announced an exciting new clinical collaboration with Pfizer to develop new -- NKTR-214 with several agents in their portfolio in 2 new tumor types. The collaboration will pursue development of NKTR-214 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Under the new agreement, Pfizer will develop various doublet and triplet combinations with NKTR-214 and Pfizer and Merck Serono's anti-PD-L1 agent avelumab; Pfizer's PARP inhibitor, talazoparib; and Pfizer and Astellas' anti-androgen agent, enzalutamide. We've worked -- we've enjoyed working very closely with the talented team at Pfizer Oncology to design this important clinical program for these patient populations with a high unmet need. Pfizer will be running the clinical work and will serve as the sponsor of this trial. And later, Mary will summarize the design of the multiple-arm clinical study in prostate and head and neck cancer. We're also planning to initiate 2 additional trials with NKTR-214, which you will see on clinicaltrials.gov within the next several months. The first will be a Phase I trial with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 Takeda's dual SYK-FLT inhibitor known as TAK-659, in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. That is scheduled to start in the first part of next year. The second will be a Phase I trial with Syndax to evaluate NKTR-214 with Syndax's HDAC inhibitor in patients with IO refractory melanoma , which is also planned to start in the first part of next year. In addition, over the last several months, we've entered into new clinical collaborations with 2 new partners, Vaccibody and BioXcel, both of which will include clinical trials with unique mechanisms in combination with NKTR-214. For Vaccibody, we will combine NKTR-214 with their personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine. BioXcel and Nektar are collaborating on the combination of NKTR-214 with their small molecule immunomodulator, a combination DPP 8/9 and FAP inhibitor, and a checkpoint inhibitor in patients with pancreatic cancer. We plan to initiate these trials in the first half of 2019.
As you know, our pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, a TLR 7/8 agonist; and NKTR-255, an IL-15 candidate, which can stimulate both NK cells and memory T cells. In April, we dosed the first patient in the REVEAL trial, which is evaluating a combination of NKTR-262 with NKTR-214. The combination of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 has enormous potential. Our preclinical data for the combination of these 2 agents demonstrates clearly how the individual agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, work together to engage the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, control the maturation and function of the underlying myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. And most importantly, modify systemic immunology to drive an abscopal anti-tumor response in tumor models. The dose escalation phase of the trial of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 is continuing to determine initial safety, efficacy, PK and biomarker characterization. We will also have the later option in the trial to evaluate a triplet of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. As I stated earlier, we plan to share some of the early clinical data from this trial this weekend at SITC. Once we've identified the recommended phase II dose, the trial is projected to enroll up to 400 patients with 8 different tumor types in first and second line as well as refractory settings.
For NKTR-255, our IL-15 candidate, we've been conducting preclinical studies evaluating NKTR-255 in oncology models driven by NK cell expansion and activation. NKTR-255 is a powerful agonist that allows us to modify NK biology for the treatment of hematological malignancies in combination with targeted antibody mechanisms. We plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in the first half of next year. 
In another application, we've been evaluating NKTR-255 in combination with multiple experimental CAR-T cell therapies in collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. High levels of native IL-15 has been associated with remissions and longer duration of response in patients with lymphoid malignancies who have undergone CAR-T regimens. So we're excited about the potential of NKTR-255 to greatly enhance CAR-T incomes as well as its potential to be combined with other mechanisms in I-O. Now moving on to our immunology program. Let me give you an update on the advancement of NKTR-358 with our partner Eli Lilly. As we've stated in the past, the initial data from the ongoing first-in-human Phase IA trial of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers has shown dose-dependent increases in T regulatory cell levels with no increase in conventional T-cells or NK cells. This is comparable to what we saw in our nonhuman primate models, and we're extremely pleased that this mechanism has now been confirmed in humans. We expect to present complete data from the Phase IA trial at a medical meeting in the first half of 2019. We also recently started the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose trial in patients with lupus. The trial is advancing very quickly and we're very excited about the potential for NKTR-358 as a resolution therapeutic to bring a new paradigm to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic, inflammatory conditions.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Mary to review additional details on the clinical work plan with Pfizer in head and neck prostate cancers and the Phase III trials in melanoma, RCC and bladder cancer with BMS."

Let me first start with reviewing the clinical plans with Pfizer in prostate and head and neck cancer. We are very excited to be working with Pfizer oncology to explore the potential of combining multiple mechanisms in 2 new solid tumor settings. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death for American men. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is an incurable disease with a very poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate under 30%. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck tends to be diagnosed very late and also has a poor prognosis. Under the new clinical collaboration, Pfizer oncology will conduct and sponsor a trial with multiple arms evaluating NKTR-214, Pfizer and Merck Serono's anti-PD-L1 agent avelumab; Pfizer's PARP inhibitor, talazoparib; and Pfizer and Astellas' androgen receptor inhibitor, enzalutamide. The planned Phase Ib/II clinical trial will include multiple patient arms. One will be a Phase II cohort to evaluate NKTR-214 plus avelumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have not received any prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Enrollment will include patients with both PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive baseline tumors. The second and third cohorts of the study will feature one Phase Ib dose escalation followed by a Phase II component to evaluate NKTR-214 plus avelumab, combined with either talazoparib or with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on one or more prior regimens. Pfizer and Nektar are finalizing the protocol and we plan to start the clinical trial in 2019. Cohorts will include 20 to 40 patients, and we will measure clinical success based on the specific combinations and reference outcomes in the various settings being investigated in the study. Now I'll spend some time reviewing the plans for melanoma, renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, which Howard mentioned are the first 3 tumor types in which BMS and Nektar will launch our registrational trials. I'll also talk about the PIVOT expansion in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, which is currently underway. Our strategy with BMS is to secure as many potential approvals in early and first-line settings across multiple solid tumor types to establish NKTR-214 plus Opdivo as the standard of care. To that end, we are initiating 3 separate studies in renal cell carcinoma, 3 separate studies in bladder cancer, and we continue to advance our registrational clinical development strategy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. First in melanoma, we are very fortunate to be collaborating with BMS, the only company to have developed an immuno oncology doublet therapy for melanoma patients. We are enrolling 760 patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma into our Phase III trial or NKTR-214 plus Opdivo. Patients will be stratified by PD-L1 status, stage of disease and BRAF. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival with the projected 22-month timeline for the final PFS analysis. Both the FDA and CHMP have agreed to an open-label study design and to our comparator arm. This pivotal study in melanoma is designed to secure NKTR-214 plus Opdivo as the first-line I-O standard of care, and we are very excited patient dosing is underway. For more details, the Phase III trial design is available on clinicaltrials.gov. In renal cell carcinoma, Bristol and Nektar are planning to launch multiple registrational trials in advanced patients, which will include separate trials to evaluate the doublet and triplet regimens of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and Yervoy in this indication. 
The first Phase III trial in first-line metastatic RCC patients will evaluate NKTR-214 plus Opdivo versus a TKI of physician's choice -- either sunitinib or cabozantinib in approximately 600 patients with intermediate or poor risk RCC. This trial design is available on clinicaltrials.gov as well. Patients will be randomized 1 to 1, and will be stratified in the trial based upon multiple factors, including PD-L1 status, IMDC prognostic score and choice of TKI. The study will look at overall survival and has an estimated time to the first interim analysis of survival of 27 months, currently forecasted to read out by the first quarter of 2021. The second Phase III trial in RCC will evaluate NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Yervoy as compared Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with previously untreated metastatic RCC. The study will enroll approximately 800 patients with intermediate or poor risk IMDC scores and will also stratify by PD-L1 status.
The third registrational trial in RCC will be a TKI inclusive regimen with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo and a TKI compared to nivo plus a TKI in patients with metastatic untreated RCC with clear cell component and all IMDC risk levels. The study will include a safety lead-in to determine the TKI combination dose for the second part of the study, which will then evaluate ORR, PFS and overall survival. As you know, we've demonstrated that treatment with NKTR-214 plus Opdivo can convert over 50% of patients whose tumors have a baseline negative PD-L1 expression to positive PD-L1 expressors. We also observed this conversion with NKTR-214 monotherapy in our first Phase I trial with NKTR-214. This is why we believe that NKTR-214 plus Opdivo can deliver on the promise of becoming the preferred standard of care as a doublet I-O regimen in many different tumor types. As the first example, we are working to incorporate this advantage of NKTR-214 observed in PD-L1 negative baseline patients into our registrational strategy in bladder cancer. 
In bladder, we're also planning a registrational program to gain approvals in first-line metastatic bladder cancer and other settings. Cis-ineligible bladder cancer patients are a population with a very high unmet need, particularly those with PD-L1 negative disease at baseline for whom single agent checkpoint inhibitors are no longer the preferred standard of care. With this in mind, our first trial in bladder cancer will be in cisplatin-ineligible patients and will focus on patients with baseline PD-L1 negative disease. We are currently finalizing the design of this study with input from the FDA. The trial will enroll over 150 patients and we are planning to include a chemotherapy comparative reference arm into the study. You will see this trial design posted on clinicaltrials.gov within the next month. The second Phase III trial on bladder cancer is planned to start in January 2019, and will be conducted in patients with newly diagnosed muscle invasive bladder cancer. The third trial in metastatic bladder cancer will be in the first-line metastatic patient population who are both cis-eligible and cis-ineligible. As Howard stated earlier, we are expanding the second-line relapse non-small cell lung cancer cohort in PIVOT to enroll approximately 100 patients who received a checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first-line. The original design of PIVOT envisions that an expansion arm in an appropriate patient population could potentially serve as a faster registrational pathway in this population which has limited options once their disease has progressed following a checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy in first-line.
As Howard stated, BMS and Nektar are highly focused on continuing to advance our broad joint development plan. And to that end, we are now designing the next wave of clinical trials beyond the 8 that I just reviewed. As Howard also communicated, we are advancing NKTR-214 with Takeda's dual SYK/FLT inhibitor, known as TAK-659, into a Phase I/II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the end of this year. TAK-659 is a clinical stage compound developed by Takeda that has already shown clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In preclinical mass tumor models, TAK-659 was shown to reduce the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory N1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Since NKTR-214 and TAK-659 target different cell populations, the 2 compounds provide a unique nonoverlapping and highly complementary mechanism to TAK-659. As the first trial with NKTR-214 in a liquid tumor setting, the study provides a strategic opportunity for us. The trial will enroll patients who are relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy, but no more than 3 prior treatments. And we expect this trial to start in the first part of 2019. With Syndax, we are designing the first combination trial of NKTR-214  with entinostat in patients with IO relapse refractory melanoma, and we expect to finalize the design before the end of this year with first patients dosed in early 2019. With that clinical update, I'd like to hand the call over to Gil."

I will start with a brief review of highlights from Nektar's third quarter of 2018 financial results and then I will review our 2018 financial guidance.
We ended the third quarter with $2 billion of cash and investments. Total revenue was $27.8 million for the quarter and $1.15 billion for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $152.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. And $212.2 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. This significant increase in 2018 revenue is a result of the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration that we closed last quarter. R&D expense came in at $102.9 million in Q3 and $290.7 million for the first 9 months of 2018 as compared to $65.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $187 million for the first 9 months of 2017. We expect our R&D expense to increase as we continue to execute on the registrational joint development plan with BMS over the coming months. In addition, we will be initiating multiple trials combining NKTR-214 with other synergistic mechanisms in various cancer settings, including trials with Takeda, Syndax, BioXcel, Vaccibody, and our trial with Pfizer in multiple tumor types. It is important to keep in mind that our annual R&D funding obligation with Bristol is subject to $125 million annual funding cap. This cap will not limit our aggregate annual GAAP R&D expense recognition, but will limit our annual cash funding obligation to $125 million prior to the commercialization of NKTR-214. We recognized a net loss of $96.1 million for the quarter, and net income of $779.5 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018. As compared to net income of $60.9 million for the third quarter of 2017, and a net loss of $62.9 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. Now let's turn to our 2018 financial guidance. Our financial guidance is unchanged. Our full-year revenue guidance remains at $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion, which includes $1.06 billion of revenue recognized in Q2 from the BMS upfront collaboration payment and a portion of the equity investment and an additional $105 million to $115 million of product sales, royalties and other revenues. Our GAAP expense guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2018 R&D expense to range between $400 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $60 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense.
G&A expense for 2018 is still projected to be between $72 million and $75 million, which includes $28 million of noncash stock compensation and depreciation expense. We continue to estimate that we will end 2018 with a cash position between $1.9 billion and $1.925 billion.

So to address the first part of your question, in PIVOT-02 we did -- we have a cohort that is second and third line non-small-cell lung cancer patients. As you know, when we saw you at ASCO this year, we did present 3 cases from that cohort and Dr. Gettinger walked through that these patients had been previously treated both with chemotherapy and at least one prior checkpoint inhibitor. Based on the early data that we saw in that cohort, we did go and have a discussion with the FDA about starting a new cohort in non-Small cell lung cancer patients that are relapsed to a checkpoint inhibitor in chemotherapy, the same regimen administered in KEYNOTE-189. Through that discussion with the FDA, this new cohort now includes 100 patients that just it's the second line -- not second and third line as our original cohort was. And we just began enrolling to this cohort: first patient is already in and we anticipate enrolling this cohort over the next 12 months. We then would follow these patients for roughly 6 months, and at that time have data to potentially present to the FDA. To address your second question about randomized trial, as both Howard and I mentioned, we are in the process of developing the next wave of clinical trials, and we do have plans for going in randomized trials both in the early setting of non-small cell lung cancer as well as later setting.

So we definitely were very aware of the data with high-dose IL-2 and entinostat in renal cell carcinoma. That was actually one of the reasons that started our initial collaboration with Syndax altogether. And then from those earliest discussions, we went into a very substantial preclinical program where we studied the 2 mechanisms in a range of different mouse and genetic tumor models to address how the underlying mechanisms of each drug work together. And where the synergy might come from when the 2 are dosed together into the same immune system. And one of the things that we discovered was a very high proportion of what we call high cytokine effector cells, that we detected into the tumor microenvironment when both drugs were dosed together. So this means specifically immune cells that were very high in like interferon gamma, TNF, and other kinds of effector cytokines. And so that was the impetus to then look into, in particular, the relapse refractory setting. Because those kind of cells are expressly the kind of cells that can overcome certain kind of resistance mechanisms. So then targeting the relapse refractory melanoma setting became a very attractive utilization of the 2 molecules. And this is why we prioritized that tumor type into the clinical trial."
