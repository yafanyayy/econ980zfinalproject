I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. 
First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very strong year. We grew Q4 revenue 4%, driving higher earnings and cash flow on the continued strength of our Land Mobile Radio solutions led by North America. We see continued demand across both our government and commercial customers around the world reflected in our recent results and our record backlog. 
Second, 2017 was a record year for sales, operating earnings, cash flow and backlog, demonstrating the earnings power of our land mobile radio platforms. In addition to growing the full year revenue 6% with growth in every region, we grew operating earnings 9%, grew EPS 11% and we grew operating cash flow 16%. 
Finally, I'm very pleased with our competitive position moving forward. I expect our LMR platform business to provide continued growth while also driving additional Managed Services expansion and further differentiating our command center software strategy. So now I would like to travel over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before turning to provide some final thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year and organic revenue up 2%. GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from",1322,"Thank you, Greg. Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year and organic revenue up 2%. GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from the year ago quarter, and operating margins were 29.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. 
GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $3.56 compared to an earnings of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. The loss reflects onetime charges of $874 million related to recent U.S. tax reform. The charges are primarily 2 items: $471 million related to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits; and $366 million related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower rate. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $2.10, up 3% from last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.2 billion from last year. Product segment backlog was up $382 million or 25% and services segment backlog was up $860 million or 13%. 
For the full year, revenue grew 6% with growth in every region and organic revenue grew 3%. Products segment revenue grew 3%, led by higher North America system sales and growth in commercial products. Services revenue grew 9% with Managed and Support Services growth in every region. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up $125 million or 9% compared to 2016. Earnings per share grew 11% to $5.46 and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $181 million from last year. 
Moving to product segment results for Q4. Q4 product sales were $1.23 billion, up 1% versus the prior year, driven by growth in North America LMR systems and global commercial products. Q4 product operating income was $425 million or 34.5% of sales, up 130 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Product backlog ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, up $382 million or 25% from last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, backlog was up $140 million or 8%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth was driven by North America and EMEA. 
Q4 services revenue was $724 million, up 10% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 17% inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $151 million or 20.9% of revenue, up 50 basis points from last year on higher sales and mix to Managed and Support Services partially offset by FX from acquisitions. Services backlog ended at $7.7 billion, up $860 million from last year inclusive of a runoff. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $567 million or 8% on continued strong demand in North America, EMEA and Asia Pac. 
Total OpEx in Q4 was $397 million, down $11 million or 3% from the year ago quarter, inclusive of $15 million from acquisitions. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.49 billion, inclusive of $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions. Other income and expense in Q4 was $46 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. 
The Q4 effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 30.7% in the year ago quarter, resulting in $11 million of higher tax expense. The full year 2017 effective tax rate was 31%. 
Q4 operating cash flow was $761 million, an increase of $248 million from last year, driven by higher operating earnings as well as improved working capital. Free cash flow was $740 million, up $287 million. We ended Q4 with $1.3 billion in cash, and during the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of stock at an average price of $91.95 and paid dividends of $76 million. 
Capital allocation in 2017 was $1.3 billion. This included $298 million of acquisitions, $370 million of dividends, $227 million of CapEx and $483 million of share repurchases at an average price of $85.32. In total, our share repurchase program has retired 53% of our shares at an average cost of $58.59. 
Finally, in Q1 of 2018, we are planning a debt funded $500 million pension contribution that takes advantage of the recent tax legislation. This funding pushes any further cash distribution to our U.S. pension plan until minimally 2024, likely beyond. In addition, this planned contribution drove the 2017 tax deduction at 35% versus 21%, providing an MPV of approximately $60 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 7% and organic growth of 5% including approximately $40 million from currency tailwinds. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.83 and $0.88. This assumes current exchange rates and an average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 5% with organic growth of approximately 4.5% with currency tailwinds of approximately $130 million. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65. The outlook does not include the pending Airbus PlantCML or Avigilon acquisitions. Airbus PlantCML is expected to close in Q1 and Avigilon is expected to close in Q2. 
Full year operating expenses are expected to be down again by approximately $20 million from 2017, inclusive of $20 million of OpEx from completed acquisitions and inclusive of $30 million in higher OpEx from currency headwinds. We expect the full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% for 2018 and 2019. 2018 operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion excluding the $500 million debt-funded pension contribution previously mentioned. 
Moving to regional results. The Americas grew 6% in Q4 and 7% for the full year. This broad-based growth was driven by P25 systems, multi-year Managed and Support Services and commercial products. Backlog is up $915 million from last year with double-digit growth in both Products and Services year-over-year as customers continue to invest in their LMR solutions. 
EMEA declined 2% in Q4 on the completion of a large LTE implementation in the prior year. For 2017, EMEA was up 5% on growth in Products and Services and backlog is up $131 million versus last year. Asia Pac grew 1% for the quarter and 1% for the year, driven by growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up $195 million primarily on services growth. 
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. First, in our product segment during Q4, we were awarded a $290 million contract for an LMR system in a Middle Eastern country that recently deployed a private public safety LTE system. The significant investment in LMR is the latest example of customers further validating that LTE and LMR are complementary technologies. We also won several large LMR deals in North America during the quarter, including a $76 million P25 order for the city of Dallas, a $53 million P25 order for the city of Los Angeles and a $39 million P25 order for the city of Toronto. 
In our services segment, we continued to see demand by our customers for multi-year support contracts for their LMR systems. A few notable Q4 awards include a $197 million 7-year managed Services contract extension for the Melbourne Metropolitan Radio Network in Australia; a $40 million 5-year Managed Services contract in Victoria Australia; and an $18 million 7-year Managed Services contract with Dow Chemical. 
I'd also like to mention a few full year operational highlights. During 2017, we launched 85 new products while reducing our device SKUs by 55%. We also launched new or expanded services offerings across devices, commercial infrastructure and LTE. We completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, adding a carrier integrated cellular push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T to provide software applications, devices and services for public safety customers on the FirstNet network. And finally, we completed the acquisition of Interexport a provider of managed services for communications systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Second, I'm especially pleased with our momentum moving forward. Our record backlog reflects the continued strong demand for LMR, led by North America, and we're making continued progress in growing our software and services business as well. And finally, we announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics. Adding Avigilon's end-to-end video capabilities and analytics for our commercial and public safety customers provide not only another key workflow stream to our solutions offering but also significantly expands the total addressable market that we serve today, paving the way for additional future growth.

I think that's testament to the strength of the demand drivers in public safety and state local. From a federal perspective, similar story. We had a great year in 2016, and frankly, we slightly beat that slightly in 2017. The demand drivers right now in the federal government are really twofold. We have a defense team. We're seeing continued spending in the defense around military base communications. That's been a strong story and then what we look at domestically here both from a law enforcement and a border patrol perspective, again, the demand and a lot of what the Trump administration is doing in terms of planning those things look to be beneficial for us as well.

So just talk to us a little bit about what the changes over the last few months have meant as far as your outlook for that business for the year.

Our current planning actually for this year on FirstNet revenues are about $20 million to $40 million. I wouldn't overinterpret that one way or the other. In fact, I hope it's above that. But just from a prudent planning standpoint, I wanted to set those goalposts as more reflective of where we are today. We just don't know what we don't know.

So taking a step back, the strategic rationale on this is -- and we're pretty enthusiastic is, first of all, video surveillance and analytics is growing. It's growing rapidly. Second, the total addressable market is in well in excess of $10 billion or $11 billion and then some. And third, video continues to be a growing proponent, a growing requirement of public safety customers and critical infrastructure customers that want a solution and would like Motorola to provide it. The thing that's especially attractive to me is this is not a commodity business. As you've seen the other actions that we've taken with the portfolio over time, I'm not interested in commodity businesses. I'm not interested in commodity margins. I like a market leader with an end-to-end platform orientation and we believe this end-to-end video surveillance suite of cameras, analytics, video management and video storage is particularly strong. Now as Gino said earlier, it's EPS-neutral and it's not included in our 2018 guidance. But Avigilon is a public company on the Canadian exchange and you can go back and kind of look at their revenue growth and the kind of execution they've had. The other thing I'd say is there's a lot of point solutions in this business. We're an end-to-end platform choice and we believe we have a distinct advantage, or we will have, when we close this acquisition around faster deployment than competitive products. And the thing especially I love is the channel synergies. So this can fit very neatly and nicely and we can take this portfolio into global public safety because they've been enterprise-centric to date largely. We can take it into U.S. Military. We can take it into U.S. federal. We can take it into our large direct sales force that serve enterprises in the commercial markets. So it's got very attractive channel synergies. And lastly, quite frankly, much like mission-critical communications, I think there is a growing aversion to having a Chinese provider do critical video surveillance and security. And I think that trend will lend itself well to us as well."

I think you can go back and track that duration to revenue and it's been consistent for the past several years. On the services side, the duration is a little bit longer as we continue to sign multi-year agreements. I referenced 7- and 5-year agreements, in some cases, 15-year services agreement and the duration, clearly, of that backlog is a bit longer."

I'm particularly comforted by the performance of the record backlog and the composition of the aged backlog that Gino referenced being higher going to '18 than '17. The environment is strong right now. Geopolitically, we grew in every region and it looks like we have the opportunity to grow in every region again. And we're anchored by North America, which continually performs very strongly. Second, I think I really like the performance in the low-end LMR business or what we also referred to as the commercial markets group. I think Malloy's team and Brda's product team have performed exceptionally well there, and we're executing quite well. I mean we've made changes on people. We've moved more front-facing bag-carrying quota-carrying people to the front lines. We continue to prudently manage OpEx. And we're I think doing a better job globally around our channel management. Now that's not meant to be a commercial because there's a lot more work to do, but I think the foundation of growth, the durability of earnings, the visibility we have of the business positions us quite well for 2018."

I believe it was less than 10 people. They were appointed really just at the oil and gas market which, as you know, is highly cyclical. Subsequent to that, we built a team that's gone after the utility market which has been our highest-performing market in commercial in the last 2 years in North America. A year ago, we scaled into transportation logistics, in manufacturing. And we've got a sizable team and really -- then really focused at the Fortune kind of 300 level. We think that's where we played most and we've also got an incredible force multiplayer in terms of our channel, and they have done an outstanding job in covering the small midsized business for us in North America. Now pivot to internationally, we've just stood up a commercial markets team, enterprise selling team in the Europe and the Middle East as well. Again, oil, large manufacturing and the couriers there is the target.

George, it's Jack. So good question by the way. Kelly is our global managed and support service business. I think Kelly has done a great job. So here's really -- there's really an inflection point in the market. We've seen this exist in the last kind of, call it, 5 to 6 years. Historically, a good deal of our customers maintain their own network and think about these are labor union employees. They come at a significant cost to the employee base. It was really an analog world. We supplied our own parts, essentially all the parts around systems. The world through P25 is pivoted to really IP-based networks, a lot of third-party components which has driven the sophistication and, frankly, the complexity of the networks, which has opened the door for us because they're so -- they're quite sophisticated to maintain. The other part of it is this whole thing about having 24-hour -- 24/7 maintenance and, more importantly, potentially looking to move on to statewide network off to just having regional controller network which has really opened the door for Managed Services as well. We've invested NOCs around the world, network operations centers. And so really, frankly, it's been a long slog in terms of North America and it's been an organic story. But around the world, we've also gone out, as Greg and Gino has outlined, and acquired operators as well.

First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very strong year. We grew Q4 revenue 4%, driving higher earnings and cash flow on the continued strength of our land mobile radio solutions led by North America. We see continued demand across both our government and commercial customers around the world reflected in our recent results and our record backlog.
Second, 2017 was a record year for sales, operating earnings, cash flow and backlog, demonstrating the earnings power of our land mobile radio platforms. In addition to growing the full year revenue 6% with growth in every region, we grew operating earnings 9%, grew EPS 11% and we grew operating cash flow 16%.
Finally, I'm very pleased with our competitive position moving forward. I expect our LMR platform business to provide continued growth while also driving additional managed services expansion and further differentiating our command center software strategy.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some final thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year and organic revenue up 2%. GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from",1319,"Thank you, Greg. Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year and organic revenue up 2%. GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were 29.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year.
GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $3.56 compared to earnings of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. The loss reflects onetime charges of $874 million related to recent U.S. tax reform. The charges are primarily 2 items: $471 million related to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits; and $366 million related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower rate.
Non-GAAP EPS was $2.10, up 3% from last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.2 billion from last year. Products segment backlog was up $382 million or 25%, and services segment backlog was up $860 million or 13%.
For the full year, revenue grew 6% with growth in every region and organic revenue grew 3%. Products segment revenue grew 3%, led by higher North America system sales and growth in commercial products. Services revenue grew 9% with Managed and Support Services growth in every region. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up $125 million or 9% compared to 2016. Earnings per share grew 11% to $5.46, and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $181 million from last year.
Moving to Product segment results for Q4. Q4 Product sales were $1.23 billion, up 1% versus the prior year, driven by growth in North America LMR systems and global commercial products. Q4 product operating income was $425 million or 34.5% of sales, up 130 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Product backlog ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, up $382 million or 25% from last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, backlog was up $140 million or 8%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth was driven by North America and EMEA.
Q4 Services revenue was $724 million, up 10% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 17%, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $151 million or 20.9% of revenue, up 50 basis points from last year on higher sales and mix to Managed and Support Services partially offset by OpEx from acquisitions. Services backlog ended at $7.7 billion, up $860 million from last year, inclusive of airwave runoff. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $567 million or 8% on continued strong demand in North America, EMEA and Asia Pac. 
Total OpEx in Q4 was $397 million, down $11 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $15 million from acquisitions. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.49 billion, inclusive of $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions. Other income and expense in Q4 was $46 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter.
The Q4 effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter, resulting in $11 million of higher tax expense. The full year 2017 effective tax rate was 31%.
Q4 operating cash flow was $761 million, an increase of $248 million from last year, driven by higher operating earnings as well as improved working capital. Free cash flow was $740 million, up $287 million. We ended Q4 with $1.3 billion in cash, and during the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of stock at an average price of $91.95 and paid dividends of $76 million.
Capital allocation in 2017 was $1.3 billion. This included $298 million of acquisitions, $370 million of dividends, $227 million of CapEx and $483 million of share repurchases at an average price of $85.32. In total, our share repurchase program has retired 53% of our shares at an average cost of $58.59.
Finally, in Q1 of 2018, we are planning a debt funded $500 million pension contribution that takes advantage of the recent tax legislation. This funding pushes any further cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan until minimally 2024, likely beyond. In addition, this planned contribution drove a 2017 tax deduction at 35% versus 21%, providing an MPV of approximately $60 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 7% and organic growth of 5%, including approximately $40 million from currency tailwinds. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.83 and $0.88. This assumes current exchange rates and an average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares.
For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 5% with organic growth of approximately 4.5% with currency tailwinds of approximately $130 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65. The outlook does not include the pending Airbus PlantCML or Avigilon acquisitions. Airbus PlantCML was expected to close in Q1, and Avigilon is expected to close in Q2.
Full year operating expenses are expected to be down again by approximately $20 million from 2017, inclusive of $20 million of OpEx from completed acquisitions and inclusive of $30 million in higher OpEx from currency headwinds. We expect the full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% for 2018 and 2019. 2018 operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, excluding the $500 million debt funded pension contribution previously mentioned.
Moving to regional results. The Americas grew 6% in Q4 and 7% for the full year. This broad-based growth was driven by P25 systems, multi-year Managed and Support Services and commercial products. Backlog is up $915 million from last year with double-digit growth in both Products and Services year-over-year as customers continue to invest in their LMR solutions.
EMEA declined 2% in Q4 on the completion of a large LTE implementation in the prior year. For 2017, EMEA was up 5% on growth in Products and Services and backlog is up $131 million versus last year.
Asia Pac grew 1% for the quarter and 1% for the year, driven by growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up $195 million primarily on services growth.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. First, in our Product segment, during Q4, we were awarded a $290 million contract for an LMR system in a Middle Eastern country that recently deployed a private public safety LTE system. This significant investment in LMR is the latest example of customers further validating that LTE and LMR are complementary technologies.
We also won several large LMR deals in North America during the quarter, including a $76 million P25 order for the city of Dallas, a $53 million P25 order for the city of Los Angeles and a $39 million P25 order for the city of Toronto.
In our Services segment, we continue to see demand by our customers for multi-year support contracts for their LMR systems. A few notable Q4 awards include a $197 million 7-year managed Services contract extension for the Melbourne Metropolitan Radio Network in Australia; a $40 million 5-year managed services contract in Victoria, Australia; and an $18 million 7-year managed services contract with Dow Chemical.
I'd also like to mention a few full year operational highlights. During 2017, we launched 85 new products while reducing our device SKUs by 55%. We also launched new or expanded services offerings across devices, commercial infrastructure and LTE. We completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, adding a carrier integrated cellular push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T to provide software applications, devices and services for public safety customers on the FirstNet network. And finally, we completed the acquisition of Interexport, a provider of managed services for communications systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

We had a great year in 2016, and frankly, we slightly beat that slightly in 2017. The demand drivers right now in the federal government are really twofold. We have a defense team. We're seeing continued spending in the defense around military base communications. That's been a strong story and then what we look at domestically here both from a law enforcement and a border patrol perspective, again, the demand and a lot of the -- a lot of what the Trump administration is doing in terms of planning, those things have looked to be beneficial for us as well.

So taking a step back, the strategic rationale on this is -- and we're pretty enthusiastic -- is, first of all, video surveillance and analytics is growing. It's growing rapidly. Second, the total addressable market is in well in excess of $10 billion or $11 billion and then some. And third, video continues to be a growing proponent, a growing requirement of public safety customers and critical infrastructure customers that want a solution and would like Motorola to provide it. The thing that's especially attractive to me is this is not a commodity business. As you've seen the other actions that we've taken with the portfolio over time, I'm not interested in commodity businesses. I'm not interested in commodity margins. I like a market leader with an end-to-end platform orientation, and we believe this end-to-end video surveillance suite of cameras, analytics, video management and video storage is particularly strong. Now we're -- as Gino said earlier, it's EPS neutral, and it's not included in our 2018 guidance. But Avigilon is a public company on the Canadian exchange, and you can go back and kind of look at their revenue growth and the kind of execution they've had. The other thing I'd say is it's -- there's a lot of point solutions in this business. We're an end-to-end platform choice, and we believe we have a distinct advantage or we will have when we close this acquisition around faster deployment than competitive products. And the thing especially I love is the channel synergies. So this can fit very neatly and nicely, and we can take this portfolio into global public safety because they've been enterprise centric to date largely. We could take it into U.S. Military. We could take it into U.S. federal. We could take it into our large direct sales force that serve enterprises in the commercial markets. So it's got very attractive channel synergies. And lastly, quite frankly, much like mission-critical communications, I think there is a growing aversion to having a Chinese provider do critical video surveillance and security. And I think that trend will lend itself well to us as well."

So you never can tell of course, but I think we've pretty effectively risk adjusted our thinking around Q1 and the full year both from a revenue standpoint and an EPS standpoint. I'm particularly comforted by the performance of the record backlog and the composition of the aged backlog that Gino referenced being higher going into '18 than '17. The environment is strong right now. Geopolitically, we grew in every region, and it looks like we have the opportunity to grow in every region again. And we're anchored by North America, which continually performs very strongly. Second, I think I really like the performance in the low-end LMR business or what we also referred to as the commercial markets group. I think Molloy's team and Brda's product team have performed exceptionally well there, and we're executing quite well. I mean, we've made changes on people. We've moved more front facing, bag carrying, quota carrying people to the front lines. We continue to prudently manage OpEx. And we're, I think, doing a better job globally around our channel management. Now that's not meant to be a commercial because there's a lot more work to do, but I think the foundation of growth, the durability of earnings, the visibility we have on the business positions us quite well for 2018."

I believe it was less than 10 people. They were appointed just really at oil and gas market, which, as you know, is highly cyclical. Subsequent to that, we built a team that's gone after the utility market, which has been our highest performing market in commercial in the last 2 years in North America. A year ago, we scaled into transportation logistics, in manufacturing, and we've got a sizable team really -- and really been really focused at the Fortune kind of 300 level. We think that's where we played most. And we've also got an incredible force multiplier in terms of our channel, and they have done an outstanding job in covering the small-, mid-sized business for us in North America. Now pivot to internationally, we've just stood up a commercial markets team, enterprise selling team in the Europe and the Middle East as well.

George, it's Jack. So good question by the way. Kelly Mark leads our Global Managed and Support Service business. I think Kelly has done a great job. So here's really -- there's really an inflection point in the market. We've seen this exist in the last kind of, call it, 5 to 6 years. Historically, a good deal of our customers maintain their own network, and think about these are labor union employees. They come at a pretty significant cost to the employee base. It was really an analog world. Our -- we supplied our own parts, essentially supplied all the parts around systems. The world through P25 is pivoted to really IP-based networks, a lot of third-party components, which has driven the sophistication and frankly, the complexity of the networks, which has opened the door for us because they're so -- they're quite sophisticated to maintain. The other part of it is this whole thing about having 24-hour -- 24/7 maintenance and more importantly, potentially looking to move on to statewide network off to just having regional control your network, which has really opened the door for managed services as well. We've invested in NOCs around the world, network operation centers. And so really, frankly, it's been a long slog in terms of North America, and it's been an organic story. But around the world, we've also gone out, as Greg and Gino has outlined, and acquired operators as well. But all in, every region grows. Every region for managed support center will not only grow but as we've kind of said before grow in the mid- to high single digits."

First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very strong year. We grew Q4 revenue 4%, driving higher earnings and cash flow on the continued strength of our land mobile radio solutions led by North America. We see continued demand across both our government and commercial customers around the world reflected in our recent results and our record backlog.
Second, 2017 was a record year for sales, operating earnings, cash flow and backlog, demonstrating the earnings power of our land mobile radio platforms. In addition to growing the full year revenue 6% with growth in every region, we grew operating earnings 9%, grew EPS 11% and we grew operating cash flow 16%.
Finally, I'm very pleased with our competitive position moving forward. I expect our LMR platform business to provide continued growth while also driving additional managed services expansion and further differentiating our command center software strategy.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some final thoughts."

Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from",1319,"Thank you, Greg. Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year and organic revenue up 2%. GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were 29.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year.
GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $3.56 compared to earnings of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. The loss reflects onetime charges of $874 million related to recent U.S. tax reform. The charges are primarily 2 items: $471 million related to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits; and $366 million related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower rate.
Non-GAAP EPS was $2.10, up 3% from last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.2 billion from last year. Products segment backlog was up $382 million or 25%, and services segment backlog was up $860 million or 13%.
For the full year, revenue grew 6% with growth in every region and organic revenue grew 3%. Products segment revenue grew 3%, led by higher North America system sales and growth in commercial products. Services revenue grew 9% with Managed and Support Services growth in every region. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up $125 million or 9% compared to 2016. Earnings per share grew 11% to $5.46, and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $181 million from last year.
Moving to Product segment results for Q4. Q4 Product sales were $1.23 billion, up 1% versus the prior year, driven by growth in North America LMR systems and global commercial products. Q4 product operating income was $425 million or 34.5% of sales, up 130 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Product backlog ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, up $382 million or 25% from last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, backlog was up $140 million or 8%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth was driven by North America and EMEA.
Q4 Services revenue was $724 million, up 10% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 17%, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $151 million or 20.9% of revenue, up 50 basis points from last year on higher sales and mix to Managed and Support Services partially offset by OpEx from acquisitions. Services backlog ended at $7.7 billion, up $860 million from last year, inclusive of airwave runoff. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $567 million or 8% on continued strong demand in North America, EMEA and Asia Pac. 
Total OpEx in Q4 was $397 million, down $11 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $15 million from acquisitions. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.49 billion, inclusive of $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions. Other income and expense in Q4 was $46 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter.
The Q4 effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter, resulting in $11 million of higher tax expense. The full year 2017 effective tax rate was 31%.
Q4 operating cash flow was $761 million, an increase of $248 million from last year, driven by higher operating earnings as well as improved working capital. Free cash flow was $740 million, up $287 million. We ended Q4 with $1.3 billion in cash, and during the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of stock at an average price of $91.95 and paid dividends of $76 million.
Capital allocation in 2017 was $1.3 billion. This included $298 million of acquisitions, $370 million of dividends, $227 million of CapEx and $483 million of share repurchases at an average price of $85.32. In total, our share repurchase program has retired 53% of our shares at an average cost of $58.59.
Finally, in Q1 of 2018, we are planning a debt funded $500 million pension contribution that takes advantage of the recent tax legislation. This funding pushes any further cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan until minimally 2024, likely beyond. In addition, this planned contribution drove a 2017 tax deduction at 35% versus 21%, providing an MPV of approximately $60 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 7% and organic growth of 5%, including approximately $40 million from currency tailwinds. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.83 and $0.88. This assumes current exchange rates and an average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares.
For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 5% with organic growth of approximately 4.5% with currency tailwinds of approximately $130 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65. The outlook does not include the pending Airbus PlantCML or Avigilon acquisitions. Airbus PlantCML was expected to close in Q1, and Avigilon is expected to close in Q2.
Full year operating expenses are expected to be down again by approximately $20 million from 2017, inclusive of $20 million of OpEx from completed acquisitions and inclusive of $30 million in higher OpEx from currency headwinds. We expect the full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% for 2018 and 2019. 2018 operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, excluding the $500 million debt funded pension contribution previously mentioned.
Moving to regional results. The Americas grew 6% in Q4 and 7% for the full year. This broad-based growth was driven by P25 systems, multi-year Managed and Support Services and commercial products. Backlog is up $915 million from last year with double-digit growth in both Products and Services year-over-year as customers continue to invest in their LMR solutions.
EMEA declined 2% in Q4 on the completion of a large LTE implementation in the prior year. For 2017, EMEA was up 5% on growth in Products and Services and backlog is up $131 million versus last year.
Asia Pac grew 1% for the quarter and 1% for the year, driven by growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up $195 million primarily on services growth.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. First, in our Product segment, during Q4, we were awarded a $290 million contract for an LMR system in a Middle Eastern country that recently deployed a private public safety LTE system. This significant investment in LMR is the latest example of customers further validating that LTE and LMR are complementary technologies.
We also won several large LMR deals in North America during the quarter, including a $76 million P25 order for the city of Dallas, a $53 million P25 order for the city of Los Angeles and a $39 million P25 order for the city of Toronto.
In our Services segment, we continue to see demand by our customers for multi-year support contracts for their LMR systems. A few notable Q4 awards include a $197 million 7-year managed Services contract extension for the Melbourne Metropolitan Radio Network in Australia; a $40 million 5-year managed services contract in Victoria, Australia; and an $18 million 7-year managed services contract with Dow Chemical.
I'd also like to mention a few full year operational highlights. During 2017, we launched 85 new products while reducing our device SKUs by 55%. We also launched new or expanded services offerings across devices, commercial infrastructure and LTE. We completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, adding a carrier integrated cellular push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T to provide software applications, devices and services for public safety customers on the FirstNet network. And finally, we completed the acquisition of Interexport, a provider of managed services for communications systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few thoughts. First I'm very, very proud of the 2017 results we posted as a direct result of our employees' dedication and focus and efforts in delivering unmatched technology and unmatched service to our global customers, many of whom put their lives on the line every single day. Second, I'm especially pleased with our momentum moving forward. Our record backlog reflects the continued strong demand for LMR led by North America, and we're making continued progress in growing our software and services business as well. And finally, we announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics. Adding Avigilon's end-to-end video capabilities and analytics for our commercial and public safety customers provides not only another key workflow stream to our solutions offering but it also significantly expands the total addressable market that we serve today, paving the way for additional future growth. The management team here remains acutely focused on continuing to grow this firm profitably and for the long term.

I think that's testament to the strength of the demand drivers in public safety and state and local. From a federal perspective, similar story. We had a great year in 2016, and frankly, we slightly beat that slightly in 2017. The demand drivers right now in the federal government are really twofold. We have a defense team. We're seeing continued spending in the defense around military base communications. That's been a strong story and then what we look at domestically here both from a law enforcement and a border patrol perspective, again, the demand and a lot of the -- a lot of what the Trump administration is doing in terms of planning, those things have looked to be beneficial for us as well. We enter 2018, frankly, in federal in a better backlog position than we did in 2017."

So just talk to us a little bit about what the changes over the last few months have meant as far as your outlook for that business for the year. And then secondly maybe for Gino.

Our current planning actually for this year on FirstNet revenues are about $20 million to $40 million. I wouldn't overinterpret that one way or the other. In fact, I hope it's above that. But just from a prudent planning standpoint, I wanted to set those goalposts as more reflective of where we are today. We just don't know what we don't know. The partnership with AT&T continues to work well and go well, but that's our expectation from a FirstNet standpoint at this point in time."

So taking a step back, the strategic rationale on this is -- and we're pretty enthusiastic -- is, first of all, video surveillance and analytics is growing. It's growing rapidly. Second, the total addressable market is in well in excess of $10 billion or $11 billion and then some. And third, video continues to be a growing proponent, a growing requirement of public safety customers and critical infrastructure customers that want a solution and would like Motorola to provide it. The thing that's especially attractive to me is this is not a commodity business. As you've seen the other actions that we've taken with the portfolio over time, I'm not interested in commodity businesses. I'm not interested in commodity margins. I like a market leader with an end-to-end platform orientation, and we believe this end-to-end video surveillance suite of cameras, analytics, video management and video storage is particularly strong. Now we're -- as Gino said earlier, it's EPS neutral, and it's not included in our 2018 guidance. But Avigilon is a public company on the Canadian exchange, and you can go back and kind of look at their revenue growth and the kind of execution they've had. The other thing I'd say is it's -- there's a lot of point solutions in this business. We're an end-to-end platform choice, and we believe we have a distinct advantage or we will have when we close this acquisition around faster deployment than competitive products. And the thing especially I love is the channel synergies. So this can fit very neatly and nicely, and we can take this portfolio into global public safety because they've been enterprise centric to date largely. We could take it into U.S. Military. We could take it into U.S. federal. We could take it into our large direct sales force that serve enterprises in the commercial markets. So it's got very attractive channel synergies. And lastly, quite frankly, much like mission-critical communications, I think there is a growing aversion to having a Chinese provider do critical video surveillance and security. And I think that trend will lend itself well to us as well."

I noticed that the breakdown of revenues geographically seems to be showing a slowdown in the U.S. but growing very fast in Europe and Asia. Do you see the opportunity essentially a turnaround in the U.S. business while also benefiting from those other tailwinds?"

I mean, I think we're pretty prudent to begin with in the way we guide the firm in Q1 and an annualized basis. So you never can tell of course, but I think we've pretty effectively risk adjusted our thinking around Q1 and the full year both from a revenue standpoint and an EPS standpoint. I'm particularly comforted by the performance of the record backlog and the composition of the aged backlog that Gino referenced being higher going into '18 than '17. The environment is strong right now. Geopolitically, we grew in every region, and it looks like we have the opportunity to grow in every region again. And we're anchored by North America, which continually performs very strongly. Second, I think I really like the performance in the low-end LMR business or what we also refer to as the commercial markets group. I think Molloy's team and Brda's product team have performed exceptionally well there, and we're executing quite well. I mean, we've made changes on people. We've moved more front facing, bag carrying, quota carrying people to the front lines. We continue to prudently manage OpEx. And we're, I think, doing a better job globally around our channel management. Now that's not meant to be a commercial because there's a lot more work to do, but I think the foundation of growth, the durability of earnings, the visibility we have on the business positions us quite well for 2018."

Subsequent to that, we built a team that's gone after the utility market, which has been our highest performing market in commercial in the last 2 years in North America. A year ago, we scaled into transportation logistics, in manufacturing, and we've got a sizable team really -- and really been really focused at the Fortune kind of 300 level. We think that's where we play most. And we've also got an incredible force multiplier in terms of our channel, and they have done an outstanding job in covering the small-, mid-sized business for us in North America.

George, it's Jack. So good question by the way. Kelly Mark leads our Global Managed and Support Service business. I think Kelly has done a great job. So here's really -- there's really an inflection point in the market. We've seen this exist in the last kind of, call it, 5 to 6 years. Historically, a good deal of our customers maintain their own network, and think about these are labor union employees. They come at a pretty significant cost to the employee base. And it was really an analog world. Our -- we supplied our own parts, essentially supplied all the parts around systems. The world through P25 has pivoted to really IP-based networks, a lot of third-party components, which has driven the sophistication and frankly, the complexity of the networks, which has opened the door for us because they're so -- they're quite sophisticated to maintain. The other part of it is this whole thing about having 24-hour -- 24/7 maintenance and more importantly, potentially looking to move on to statewide network off just having regional control your network, which has really opened the door for managed services as well. We've invested in NOCs around the world, network operation centers. And so really, frankly, it's been a long slog in terms of North America, and it's been an organic story. But around the world, we've also gone out, as Greg and Gino has outlined, and acquired operators as well. But all in, every region grows. Every region for managed support center will not only grow but as we've kind of said before grow in the mid- to high-single digits."

First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very strong year. We grew Q4 revenue 4%, driving higher earnings and cash flow on the continued strength of our land mobile radio solutions led by North America. We see continued demand across both our government and commercial customers around the world reflected in our recent results and our record backlog.
Second, 2017 was a record year for sales, operating earnings, cash flow and backlog, demonstrating the earnings power of our land mobile radio platforms. In addition to growing the full year revenue 6% with growth in every region, we grew operating earnings 9%, grew EPS 11% and we grew operating cash flow 16%.
Finally, I'm very pleased with our competitive position moving forward. I expect our LMR platform business to provide continued growth while also driving additional managed services expansion and further differentiating our command center software strategy.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some final thoughts."

GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $3.56 compared to earnings of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. The loss reflects onetime charges of $874 million related to recent U.S. tax reform. The charges are primarily 2 items: $471 million related to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits; and $366 million related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower rate.
Non-GAAP EPS was $2.10, up 3% from last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.2 billion from last year. Products segment backlog was up $382 million or 25%, and services segment backlog was up $860 million or 13%.

Products segment revenue grew 3%, led by higher North America system sales and growth in commercial products. Services revenue grew 9% with Managed and Support Services growth in every region. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up $125 million or 9% compared to 2016. Earnings per share grew 11% to $5.46, and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $181 million from last year.
Moving to Product segment results for Q4. Q4 Product sales were $1.23 billion, up 1% versus the prior year, driven by growth in North America LMR systems and global commercial products. Q4 product operating income was $425 million or 34.5% of sales, up 130 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Product backlog ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, up $382 million or 25% from last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, backlog was up $140 million or 8%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth was driven by North America and EMEA.
Q4 Services revenue was $724 million, up 10% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 17%, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $151 million or 20.9% of revenue, up 50 basis points from last year on higher sales and mix to Managed and Support Services partially offset by OpEx from acquisitions. Services backlog ended at $7.7 billion, up $860 million from last year, inclusive of airwave runoff. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $567 million or 8% on continued strong demand in North America, EMEA and Asia Pac. 
Total OpEx in Q4 was $397 million, down $11 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $15 million from acquisitions. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.49 billion, inclusive of $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions. Other income and expense in Q4 was $46 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter.
The Q4 effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter, resulting in $11 million of higher tax expense. The full year 2017 effective tax rate was 31%.
Q4 operating cash flow was $761 million, an increase of $248 million from last year, driven by higher operating earnings as well as improved working capital. Free cash flow was $740 million, up $287 million. We ended Q4 with $1.3 billion in cash, and during the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of stock at an average price of $91.95 and paid dividends of $76 million.
Capital allocation in 2017 was $1.3 billion. This included $298 million of acquisitions, $370 million of dividends, $227 million of CapEx and $483 million of share repurchases at an average price of $85.32. In total, our share repurchase program has retired 53% of our shares at an average cost of $58.59.
Finally, in Q1 of 2018, we are planning a debt-funded $500 million pension contribution that takes advantage of the recent tax legislation. This funding pushes any further cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan until minimally 2024, likely beyond. In addition, this planned contribution drove a 2017 tax deduction at 35% versus 21%, providing an MPV of approximately $60 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 7% and organic growth of 5%, including approximately $40 million from currency tailwinds. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.83 and $0.88. This assumes current exchange rates and an average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares.
For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 5% with organic growth of approximately 4.5% with currency tailwinds of approximately $130 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65. The outlook does not include the pending Airbus PlantCML or Avigilon acquisitions. Airbus PlantCML was expected to close in Q1, and Avigilon is expected to close in Q2.
Full year operating expenses are expected to be down again by approximately $20 million from 2017, inclusive of $20 million of OpEx from completed acquisitions and inclusive of $30 million in higher OpEx from currency headwinds. We expect the full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% for 2018 and 2019. 2018 operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, excluding the $500 million debt funded pension contribution previously mentioned.
Moving to regional results. The Americas grew 6% in Q4 and 7% for the full year. This broad-based growth was driven by P25 systems, multi-year Managed and Support Services and commercial products. Backlog is up $915 million from last year with double-digit growth in both Products and Services year-over-year as customers continue to invest in their LMR solutions.
EMEA declined 2% in Q4 on the completion of a large LTE implementation in the prior year. For 2017, EMEA was up 5% on growth in Products and Services and backlog is up $131 million versus last year.
Asia Pac grew 1% for the quarter and 1% for the year, driven by growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up $195 million primarily on services growth.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. First, in our Product segment, during Q4, we were awarded a $290 million contract for an LMR system in a Middle Eastern country that recently deployed a private public safety LTE system. This significant investment in LMR is the latest example of customers further validating that LTE and LMR are complementary technologies.
We also won several large LMR deals in North America during the quarter, including a $76 million P25 order for the city of Dallas, a $53 million P25 order for the city of Los Angeles and a $39 million P25 order for the city of Toronto.
In our Services segment, we continue to see demand by our customers for multi-year support contracts for their LMR systems. A few notable Q4 awards include a $197 million 7-year managed Services contract extension for the Melbourne Metropolitan Radio Network in Australia; a $40 million 5-year managed services contract in Victoria, Australia; and an $18 million 7-year managed services contract with Dow Chemical.
I'd also like to mention a few full year operational highlights. During 2017, we launched 85 new products while reducing our device SKUs by 55%. We also launched new or expanded services offerings across devices, commercial infrastructure and LTE. We completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, adding a carrier-integrated cellular push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T to provide software applications, devices and services for public safety customers on the FirstNet network. And finally, we completed the acquisition of Interexport, a provider of managed services for communications systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Second, I'm especially pleased with our momentum moving forward. Our record backlog reflects the continued strong demand for LMR led by North America, and we're making continued progress in growing our software and services business as well. And finally, we announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics. Adding Avigilon's end-to-end video capabilities and analytics for our commercial and public safety customers provides not only another key workflow stream to our solutions offering but it also significantly expands the total addressable market that we serve today, paving the way for additional future growth. The management team here remains acutely focused on continuing to grow this firm profitably and for the long term.

We had a great year in 2016, and frankly, we slightly beat that slightly in 2017. The demand drivers right now in the federal government are really twofold. We have a defense team. We're seeing continued spending in the defense around military base communications. That's been a strong story and then what we look at domestically here both from a law enforcement and a border patrol perspective, again, the demand and a lot of the -- a lot of what the Trump administration is doing in terms of planning, those things have looked to be beneficial for us as well.

Second, the total addressable market is in well in excess of $10 billion or $11 billion and then some. And third, video continues to be a growing proponent, a growing requirement of public safety customers and critical infrastructure customers that want a solution and would like Motorola to provide it. The thing that's especially attractive to me is this is not a commodity business. As you've seen the other actions that we've taken with the portfolio over time, I'm not interested in commodity businesses. I'm not interested in commodity margins. I like a market leader with an end-to-end platform orientation, and we believe this end-to-end video surveillance suite of cameras, analytics, video management and video storage is particularly strong. Now we're -- as Gino said earlier, it's EPS neutral, and it's not included in our 2018 guidance. But Avigilon is a public company on the Canadian exchange, and you can go back and kind of look at their revenue growth and the kind of execution they've had. The other thing I'd say is it's -- there's a lot of point solutions in this business. We're an end-to-end platform choice, and we believe we have a distinct advantage or we will have when we close this acquisition around faster deployment than competitive products. And the thing especially I love is the channel synergies. So this can fit very neatly and nicely, and we can take this portfolio into global public safety because they've been enterprise centric to date largely. We could take it into U.S. Military. We could take it into U.S. federal. We could take it into our large direct sales force that serve enterprises in the commercial markets. So it's got very attractive channel synergies. And lastly, quite frankly, much like mission-critical communications, I think there is a growing aversion to having a Chinese provider do critical video surveillance and security. And I think that trend will lend itself well to us as well."

I mean, I think we're pretty prudent to begin with in the way we guide the firm in Q1 and an annualized basis. So you never can tell of course, but I think we've pretty effectively risk adjusted our thinking around Q1 and the full year both from a revenue standpoint and an EPS standpoint. I'm particularly comforted by the performance of the record backlog and the composition of the aged backlog that Gino referenced being higher going into '18 than '17. The environment is strong right now. Geopolitically, we grew in every region, and it looks like we have the opportunity to grow in every region again. And we're anchored by North America, which continually performs very strongly. Second, I think I really like the performance in the low-end LMR business or what we also refer to as the commercial markets group. I think Molloy's team and Brda's product team have performed exceptionally well there, and we're executing quite well. I mean, we've made changes on people. We've moved more front facing, bag carrying, quota carrying people to the front lines. We continue to prudently manage OpEx. And we're, I think, doing a better job globally around our channel management. Now that's not meant to be a commercial because there's a lot more work to do, but I think the foundation of growth, the durability of earnings, the visibility we have on the business positions us quite well for 2018."

I believe it was less than 10 people. They were appointed just really at oil and gas market, which, as you know, is highly cyclical. Subsequent to that, we built a team that's gone after the utility market, which has been our highest performing market in commercial in the last 2 years in North America. A year ago, we scaled into transportation logistics, in manufacturing, and we've got a sizable team really -- and really been really focused at the Fortune kind of 300 level. We think that's where we play most. And we've also got an incredible force multiplier in terms of our channel, and they have done an outstanding job in covering the small-, mid-sized business for us in North America. Now pivot to internationally, we've just stood up a commercial markets team, enterprise selling team in the Europe and the Middle East as well. Again, oil, large manufacturing and the couriers there is the target and so to your point, moving from just an oil and gas practice into really a multi-manufacturing environment, where really Bruce's portfolio scales quite well.

George, it's Jack. So good question by the way. Kelly Mark leads our Global Managed and Support Service business. I think Kelly has done a great job. So here's really -- there's really an inflection point in the market. We've seen this exist in the last kind of, call it, 5 to 6 years. Historically, a good deal of our customers maintain their own network, and think about these are labor union employees. They come at a pretty significant cost to the employee base. And it was really an analog world. Our -- we supplied our own parts, essentially supplied all the parts around systems. The world through P25 has pivoted to really IP-based networks, a lot of third-party components, which has driven the sophistication and frankly, the complexity of the networks, which has opened the door for us because they're so -- they're quite sophisticated to maintain. The other part of it is this whole thing about having 24-hour -- 24/7 maintenance and more importantly, potentially looking to move on to statewide network off just having regional control your network, which has really opened the door for managed services as well. We've invested in NOCs around the world, network operation centers. And so really, frankly, it's been a long slog in terms of North America, and it's been an organic story. But around the world, we've also gone out, as Greg and Gino has outlined, and acquired operators as well. But all in, every region grows. Every region for managed support center will not only grow but as we've kind of said before grow in the mid- to high-single digits."

I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15% with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region led by North America organic growth of 8%. 
Second, we're raising full year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14% which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5% and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85. 
And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7% including $39 million of favorable FX. During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission which has historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses. For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS which occurred in Q1. 
GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 million versus last year. Product segment backlog was up $166 million or 11% and services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%. Q1 product sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year on growth in every region. North America product revenue was up 14% in the quarter. 
Q1 product segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard ASC 606. 
Turning to services. Q1 services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 21% to $496 million inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued managed and support growth. Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed and Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%. 
Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million. FX added $12 million and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business. 
For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017. 
Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago, and the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year. Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017. 
Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy iridium settlement in India and $50 million of costs related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and plant. 
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and use $400 million from our credit revolver as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15% with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February. Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5% with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance. This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance. EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85, versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant with approximately $0.04 of EPS net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million with approximately $0.01 of EPS. 
Looking at regional results. Americans revenue was up 15% with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period. And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year. 
And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% and growth on growth Products and Services including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong services demand. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the state of Florida to build and manage a new statewide public safety network. This multi-year award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio. Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Maryland; a $20 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Indiana; a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade from county in Florida; a $6 million Managed and Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America; and we announced the LEX L11 mission-critical LTE handheld device for mobile broadband networks including FirstNet in the U.S. 
Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and next-generation 911. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Now it's worth noting that in Q1, we have the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in Q1. That was 4x larger than the next largest shipment, and that's great. But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%. Second half is 4% and the full year is 4%. I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up.

Obviously, as Greg has alluded to in the previous call, we kept this company as operating as they were before, and we've got a couple of significant opportunities. First and foremost, the United States federal government. Avigilon did not sell into the Fed's space, either the federal or the military space. We have opportunities really throughout that market, and obviously, we're losing our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the federal government. The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like safe city, the Detroit greenlight projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after.

But interestingly enough, they don't do much business because they were a smaller company and they found that the business turned better focused on enterprise securities space. They haven't focused on public safety. Now we have done large cities. Obviously, we manage the city of Chicago's video network, which is the largest public safety video network in the country. We've done Cleveland and the Detroit project as well. So we really -- frankly, James Henderson and I have talked about this. We looked at government public safety as, frankly, open space. And we think that is a market, obviously, our sales team knows very well and we think there's only uplift as it applies to public safety and government in terms of Avigilon."

I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15% with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region led by North America organic growth of 8%.
Second, we're raising full year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5%, and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85.
And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year, including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7%, including $39 million of favorable FX.
During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission, which has historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses. For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS, which occurred in Q1.
GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year.
Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 million versus last year. Product segment backlog was up $166 million or 11%, and Services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%. Q1 product sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year on growth in every region. North America product revenue was up 14% in the quarter.
Q1 product segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard, ASC 606. 
Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 21% to $496 million, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued Managed and Support growth. Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed and Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%.
Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million. FX added $12 million, and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business.
For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017.
Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%.
Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year. Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017.
Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy Iridium settlement in India and $50 million of cost related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant.
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt, which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and use $400 million from our credit revolver as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15%, with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February. Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5%, with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance.
This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance. EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85, versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant, with approximately $0.04 of EPS net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million, with approximately $0.01 of EPS.
Looking at regional results. Americas' revenue was up 15%, with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas' growth was driven by strong demand for LMR, Products and Services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period. And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services, including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% on growth on growth Products and Services, including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong services demand.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the state of Florida to build and manage a new state-wide public safety network. This multiyear award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio. Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Maryland; a $20 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Indiana; a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade from Miami-Dade County in Florida; a $6 million Managed and Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America; and we announced the LEX L11 Mission Critical LTE handheld device for mobile broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S.
Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and next-generation 911.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Now it's worth noting that in Q1 we have the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in a Q1. That was 4x larger than the next largest shipment, and that's great. But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%. Second half is 4% and the full year is 4%. I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up. I don't -- we don't look at it as a deceleration normalized for that large order. We look at it more as a constant linearity of demand throughout the year."

And obviously, we're using our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the federal government. The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like, safe city, the Detroit Green Light Projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after.

I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15% with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region, led by North America organic growth of 8%.
Second, we're raising full year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5%, and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85.
And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year, including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7%, including $39 million of favorable FX.
During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission, which has historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses. For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS, which occurred in Q1.
GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year.
Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 billion versus last year. Product segment backlog was up $166 million or 11%, and Services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%. Q1 product sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year on growth in every region. North America product revenue was up 14% in the quarter.
Q1 product segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard, ASC 606. 
Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 21% to $496 million, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued Managed and Support growth. Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed and Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%.
Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million. FX added $12 million, and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business.
For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017.
Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%.
Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year. Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017.
Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy Iridium settlement in India and $50 million of cost related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant.
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt, which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and used $400 million from our credit revolver as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15%, with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February. Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5%, with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance.
This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance. EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85 versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant, with approximately $0.04 of EPS net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million, with approximately $0.01 of EPS.
Looking at regional results. Americas' revenue was up 15%, with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas' growth was driven by strong demand for LMR, Products and Services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period. And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services, including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% on growth in both Products and Services, including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong Services demand.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the state of Florida to build and manage a new state-wide public safety network. This multiyear award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio. Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Maryland; a $20 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Indiana; a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade from Miami-Dade County in Florida; a $6 million Managed and Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America; and we announced the LEX L11 Mission Critical LTE handheld device for mobile broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S.
Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and next-generation 911.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Now it's worth noting that in Q1 we had the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in a Q1. That was 4x larger than the next-largest shipment, and that's great. But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%. Second half is 4% and the full year is 4%. I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up. I don't -- we don't look at it as a deceleration normalized for that large order. We look at it more as a constant linearity of demand throughout the year."

Obviously, as Greg has alluded to in the previous call, we've kept this company as -- operating as they were before, and we've got a couple of significant opportunities. First and foremost, the United States federal government. Avigilon did not sell into the Fed's space, either the federal or the military space. We have opportunities, really, throughout that market. And obviously, we're using our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the federal government. The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like, safe city, the Detroit Green Light Projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after.

I think the way we're modeling this business and what's contemplated in our full year growth is a double-digit revenue growth comparable to last year. Look, they were a public company. You've seen what they did. I think they were $353 million to $408 million publicly traded on the Vancouver exchange. That kind of growth rate is our current expectation, by the way. I mean, I think we want to be very prudent in modeling the business and don't get out ahead of our headlights. But there's no question, the demand is pretty strong. Video is there.

I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15% with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region, led by North America organic growth of 8%.
Second, we're raising full year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5%, and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85.
And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year, including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7%, including $39 million of favorable FX.
During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission, which has historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses. For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS, which occurred in Q1.
GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year.
Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 billion versus last year. Product segment backlog was up $166 million or 11%, and Services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%. Q1 product sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year on growth in every region. North America product revenue was up 14% in the quarter.
Q1 product segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard, ASC 606. 
Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 21% to $496 million, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions. Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued Managed and Support growth. Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed and Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%.
Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million. FX added $12 million, and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business.
For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017.
Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%.
Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year. Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017.
Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy Iridium settlement in India and $50 million of cost related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant.
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt, which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and used $400 million from our credit revolver as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15%, with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February. Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5%, with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance.
This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance. EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85 versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant, with approximately $0.04 of EPS net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million, with approximately $0.01 of EPS.
Looking at regional results. Americas' revenue was up 15%, with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas' growth was driven by strong demand for LMR, Products and Services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period. And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services, including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% on growth in both Products and Services, including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong Services demand.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the state of Florida to build and manage a new state-wide public safety network. This multiyear award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio. Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Maryland; a $20 million Managed and Support Services contract with the state of Indiana; a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade from Miami-Dade County in Florida; a $6 million Managed and Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America; and we announced the LEX L11 Mission Critical LTE handheld device for mobile broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S.
Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and next-generation 911.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Now it's worth noting that in Q1 we had the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in a Q1. That was 4x larger than the next-largest shipment, and that's great. But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%. Second half is 4% and the full year is 4%. I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up. I don't -- we don't look at it as a deceleration normalized for that large order. We look at it more as a constant linearity of demand throughout the year."

Obviously, as Greg has alluded to in the previous call, we've kept this company as -- operating as they were before, and we've got a couple of significant opportunities. First and foremost, the United States federal government. Avigilon did not sell into the Fed's space, either the federal or the military space. We have opportunities, really, throughout that market. And obviously, we're using our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the federal government. The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like, safe city, the Detroit Green Light Projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after. And the last thing is really heavy industry or enterprise Fortune kind of 300 kind of companies in both -- in North America but throughout the world, and we're also looking to work closely with them on that.

We've done Cleveland, and the Detroit project as well. So we really -- frankly, James Henderson and I have talked about this. We look at government and public safety as, frankly, open space. And we think that is a market, obviously, our sales team knows very well, and we think there's only uplift as it applies to public safety and government in terms of Avigilon."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."
99186,574625383,1519696,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2018",2018-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software. The change consists of moving systems integration from our former Services",1100,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software. The change consists of moving systems integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from a our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes Managed and Support Services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisition and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72 based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. In Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

As it relates to Hytera, first of all, we're very pleased with the progress on Hytera.

As you probably know, just a few weeks ago, less than 10 days ago, we filed an additional copyright infringement lawsuit, which basically is effectively them copying source codes. So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hecker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the Services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, in my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will still be facing many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states.

I think execution's better. By the way, there's better products as well. And I'm talking LMR. Not just this year, but some things on tap for next year. So the inorganic growth is excellent, and the organic growth is excellent. And I think we largely are either holding or taking share, and the execution is pretty sound. I don't know Jack if you want to add anything on that."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."

First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Service",1099,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes managed and support services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and Wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond, in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72, based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. In Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, in my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay -- be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states.

After the demonstration, there's typically anytime -- anywhere between a 3- to 6-month process, whereby they make an award decision, negotiate a contract and then have to take it to a county board. So all-in, you're typically looking at a 2-year sales cycle, but the important thing for us was it was incremental to government capital budgets. It's 911 money, which was new money, that we had no ability to compete for in the past."

Is that true? And does that impact your financial model at all? Who's the subsidy provider there on that? Or is it more that's what the media says and maybe those are test devices? How should we think about the subsidies on some of those devices? And then my second question, which is probably more for Gino, is you had a very good Financial Analyst Day earlier in the year, and a lot of the investors in buy side and sell side are getting very comfortable with your financial reporting model. And now it appears you're making some changes for it. What's really behind the model changes for your reporting structure? Are there certain things you really, really, really, want to drive home to focus on in the next few years?

What you referenced on FirstNet and subsidies doesn't affect the way we are modeling the business or thinking about FirstNet, either this year or beyond. By the way, FirstNet revenue contribution was virtually 0 again for us in Q2 as it was in Q1. I think that the kind of subscriber that we were looking for hasn't materialized there. That's fine. A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push-to-talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us. So that's a good thing. But -- and also, I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan. So we don't see material growth in FirstNet to date, and our expectations for the full year in 2018 are minimal."

And it's pretty high consistently. I think there's also things internally on the management side, whether it's compensation adjustments, sales coverage, stronger indirect channels, EMEA work that was done very well by Viv Francis and Mark Schmidl out there. I think execution is better. By the way, there's better products as well, not -- and I'm talking LMR. Not just this year, but some things on tap for next year.

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."
99186,574625383,1532640,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2018",2018-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Service",1100,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes managed and support services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and Wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond, in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72, based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

As it relates to Hytera, first of all, we're very pleased with the progress on Hytera. We won a court ruling in the ITC in July, and we recently won a ruling in Germany in Mannheim federal court for patent infringement. As you probably know, just a few weeks ago, less than 10 days ago, we filed an additional copyright infringement lawsuit, which basically is effectively them copying source code. So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

On Services and Software, as Gino and I have already mentioned, I think that there's a meaningful operating margin improvement in 2019 and beyond.

But our belief is that the opportunity probably in that segment is more on the gross margin side. As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, and my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay -- be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states. I think at the end of the day, there's a few ingredients in the blender, if you will, that we'll take under consideration.

One of the reasons we made the acquisitions in the command center and the organic R&D investments we've made is because we looked at that as being a distinct and additive funding stream to our customers. We didn't necessarily play in the 911 funding space before. So as you start to drill that down at any particular project, typically, these command center, 911 radio console, computer aided dispatch are around a 2-year selling cycle. Typically, they would sometimes they'll write it homegrown. Oftentimes, they'll hire a consultant. They'll put it out for RFP. They'll down-select into maybe 2, sometimes 3 vendors. At which time, they'll go through a demonstration. After the demonstration, there's typically anytime -- anywhere between a 3- to 6-month process, whereby they'd make an award decision, negotiate a contract and then have to take it to a county board. So all-in, you're typically looking at a 2-year sales cycle, but the important thing for us was it was incremental to government capital budgets.

A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push-to-talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us. So that's a good thing. But -- and also, I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan.

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."

First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Service",1100,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes managed and support services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and Wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond, in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72, based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

On Services and Software, as Gino and I have already mentioned, I think that there's a meaningful operating margin improvement in 2019 and beyond. I think we're looking for something more like 30% operating margins or close to 30% operating margins for 2019. And I don't think there's any reason to stop there on that segment.

But our belief is that the opportunity probably in that segment is more on the gross margin side. As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, and my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay -- be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states.

Typically, they would sometimes they'll write it homegrown. Oftentimes, they'll hire a consultant. They'll put it out for RFP. They'll down-select into maybe 2, sometimes 3 vendors.

By the way, with that extension of Airwave, obviously, there'll be device opportunities that are contemplated. And given the fact that Airwave will be in for much longer, Jack's team has already engaged in conversations with the customer this year. And I'm sure that we'll go into next year for device refresh because of the new understanding that Airwave will be extended."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."

First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Service",1100,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes managed and support services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and Wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond, in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72, based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

But our belief is that the opportunity probably in that segment is more on the gross margin side. As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, and my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay -- be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states.

Is that true? Does that impact your financial model at all? Who's the subsidy provider there on that? Or is it more that's what the media says and maybe those are test devices? How should we think about the subsidies on some of those devices? And then my second question, which is probably more for Gino, is you had a very good Financial Analyst Day earlier in the year, and a lot of the investors in buy side and sell side are getting very comfortable with your financial reporting model. And now it appears you're making some changes for it. What's really behind the model changes for your reporting structure? Are there certain things you really, really, really, want to drive home to focus on in the next few years? And then, are there a few things that we need to deemphasize that maybe you have historically in the past?"

What you referenced on FirstNet and subsidies doesn't affect the way we are modeling the business or thinking about FirstNet, either this year or beyond. By the way, FirstNet revenue contribution was virtually 0 again for us in Q2 as it was in Q1. I think that the kind of subscriber that we were looking for hasn't materialized there. That's fine. A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push-to-talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us. So that's a good thing. But -- and also, I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan. So we don't see material growth in FirstNet to date, and our expectations for the full year in 2018 are minimal."

I think there's also things internally on the management side, whether it's compensation adjustments, sales coverage, stronger indirect channels, EMEA work that was done very well by Viv Francis and Mark Schmidl out there. I think execution is better. By the way, there's better products as well, not -- and I'm talking LMR. Not just this year, but some things on tap for next year.

We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Greg."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter. 
Second, our outlook. We're raising both revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. 
And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position, coupled with our Avigilon acquisition, provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few -- some closing thoughts."
99186,574625383,1544930,"Motorola Solutions, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2018",2018-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Service",1100,"Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our reporting -- our segment reporting. The new segments are: Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment. 
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes managed and support services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and Wave solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing. 
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. 
GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year. GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. 
Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase. 
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. 
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform. We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond, in both Services and Software. 
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition. 
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. 
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during that second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition, and we paid dividends of $84 million. 
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13%, with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72, based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR Products and Services as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year. 
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million 5-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services. In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multiyear support agreement for a large countywide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multiyear managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations, with Q2 growth in the high teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. 
Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products. 
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base, and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Product and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically -- it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. 
And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris."

So we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever he we need to do to protect our IP, and we feel very good about the progress we're making. We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting, there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside in ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground, and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know, but that's my view on Hytera. In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves."" There might be 1 or 2 that materialize this year. Hard to say, but we're always looking, given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark, to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So we'll continue to evaluate accordingly."

But our belief is that the opportunity probably in that segment is more on the gross margin side. As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view, and my view, is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay -- be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution. And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the U.K. Home Office solution between those 2 will look more and more like FirstNet here in the states.

First of all, good question. There's 2 things. One of the reasons we made the acquisitions in the command center and the organic R&D investments we've made is because we looked at that as being a distinct and additive funding stream to our customers. We didn't necessarily play in the 911 funding space before. So as you start to drill that down at any particular project, typically, these command center, 911 radio console, computer aided dispatch are around a 2-year selling cycle. Typically, they would sometimes they'll write it homegrown. Oftentimes, they'll hire a consultant. They'll put it out for RFP. They'll down-select into maybe 2, sometimes 3 vendors. At which time, they'll go through a demonstration. After the demonstration, there's typically anytime -- anywhere between a 3- to 6-month process, whereby they'd make an award decision, negotiate a contract and then have to take it to a county board. So all-in, you're typically looking at a 2-year sales cycle, but the important thing for us was it was incremental to government capital budgets.

A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push-to-talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us. So that's a good thing. But -- and also, I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan.

First, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 13%; grew EPS, 27%; generated more cash compared to last year on continued strength in both segments. Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year and now sits at a Q3 record ending $9.5 billion and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog related to the Airwave ESN extensions or the state of Florida award. And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency.
GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings as well as lower tax rate.
Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record and was up $572 million or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with Systems Integration on a few large projects. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%.
Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million or 9% versus last year with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million or 22% from last year with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable as margin mix. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28% and continue to expect full year 2019 margins of approximately 30%.
Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million or 5% versus last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year due to 2017 tax reform, returned to provision adjustments both in the quarter and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending and IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw a strong demand for LMR Products and Services, command center software and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was down 1% with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%.
Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded the contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing Tetra network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the city of Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million orders from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command-and-control and management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the city of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral vault integrates with our customers existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion and earnings potential of this segment going forward.
And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments and large addressable markets. We have a strong team focus on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.

From the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I. Yes, the way to think about [ PS&I ] is obviously, PS&I now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional cost in the acquisitions, both from a [ VGM ] perspective and frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year, I think I mentioned in my prior comments, to end the year at approximately 21%.

Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year and now sits at a Q3 record-ending $9.5 billion and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog related to the Airwave and ESN extensions or the State of Florida award. And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency.
GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings as well as a lower tax rate.
Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million or 9% versus last year with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million or 22% from last year with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28% and continue to expect full year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million or 5% versus last year driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments both in the quarter and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw a strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was down 1% with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command-and-control and management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results that were led by North America.

Second, I like our momentum in the Services and Software segment. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion and earnings potential of this segment going forward.
And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments with large addressable markets. We have a strong team focus on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.

From a -- the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I (sic) [ P&SI ], yes, so the way to think about PS&I is, obviously, PS&I now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional cost in the acquisitions, both from a VGM perspective and, frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year -- I think I mentioned in my prior comments, to end the year at approximately 21%.

You talked about Software and Services and Avigilon, but I'm very pleased with the land mobile radio business as well. Look, as we -- we're not going to guide specifically on 2019, but the way we think about it currently is the segment of Product and Systems Integration is generally a low single-digit revenue growth business, Services and Software all-in is a high single-digit business. And our current thinking -- I feel very good about our momentum, feel very good about our record Q3 backlog. But our current thinking is organic revenue growth constant currency next year can be comparable to this year. And that's with about $80 million of FX headwinds for next year. And that current thinking also contemplates no meaningful FirstNet revenue contribution next year. Now having said that, from a linearity standpoint, we always have Q1 being much lighter than normal as we look at the full year. And I think that, that kind of performance for '19 will be comparable to '18. But that's our current thinking."

The LMR project business remains -- frankly, it's very robust. I would tether that comment to the fact that the team's executed very well with the portfolio that we've got a couple new product introductions. We have not announced the new product yet but both from command center software, we've got a lot on the horizon there, but also some nice things here in 2019 related to our devices as well.

Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year and now sits at a Q3 record-ending $9.5 billion and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog related to the Airwave and ESN extensions or the State of Florida award. And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.

Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency.
GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings as well as a lower tax rate.
Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million or 9% versus last year with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million or 22% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28% and continue to expect full year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million or 5% versus last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year ago quarter due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million compared to $41 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments both in the quarter and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw a strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was down 1% with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs, given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command-and-control and the management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral Vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral Vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments and large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.

From a -- the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I (sic) [ P&SI ], yes, so the way to think about PS&I is, obviously, PS&I now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional cost in the acquisitions, both from a VGM perspective and, frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year -- I think I mentioned in my prior comments, to end the year at approximately 21%.

So first of all, I think the first part of the question was related to big deals. Obviously, in Greg's intro, we talked about the State of Florida, which is, frankly, the biggest state-wide project. It was a legacy Harris customer that we've been awarded. So we have that, and we have multiple other state-wide upgrades that we're in pursuit of. The LMR project business remains -- frankly, it's very robust. I would tether that comment to the fact that the team's executed very well with the portfolio that we've got a couple new product introductions. We have not announced the new product yet, but both from command center software, we've got a lot on the horizon there, but also some nice things here in 2019 related to our devices as well. So the sales team is very poised, very excited to take that to market. But -- so I think the culmination of the market driver, state and local revenue, receipts being up, very good federal budget situation for us, coupled with new product on the horizon, it's exciting times, I think, in the Project 25 and PCR business."

First, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 13%, grew EPS 27% and generated more cash compared to last year on continued strength in both segments. Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year and now sits at a Q3 record-ending $9.5 billion and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog related to the Airwave and ESN extensions or the State of Florida award. And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.

Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency.
GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings as well as a lower tax rate.
Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million or 9% versus last year with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million or 22% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28% and continue to expect full year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million or 5% versus last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year ago quarter due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million compared to $41 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments both in the quarter and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw a strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was down 1% with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs, given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command-and-control and the management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral Vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral Vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Second, I like our momentum in the Services and Software segment. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion and earnings potential of this segment going forward.
And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments and large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.
I'll now turn the call back over to Chris."

From a -- the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I (sic) [ P&SI ], yes, so the way to think about PS&I is, obviously, PS&I now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional cost in the acquisitions, both from a VGM perspective and, frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year -- I think I mentioned in my prior comments, to end the year at approximately 21%.

So I'm pleased with the way Jack is running it. Remember, we're operating it as a fully contained subsidiary.

I think it will take some traction to get utilization and a final definition in agreement. But the Airwave extension is pretty cut and dry and clear for that 3-year monetization of $1.45 billion.

Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings as well as a lower tax rate.
Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million or 9% versus last year with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million or 22% from last year with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix. We expect full year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28% and continue to expect full year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million or 5% versus last year driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments both in the quarter and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw a strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was down 1% with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command-and-control and the management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral Vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral Vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results that were led by North America. We see strong demand across land mobile radio products, Services and Software, and the Avigilon acquisition continues to perform ahead of our expectations.
Second, I like our momentum in the Services and Software segment. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion and earnings potential of this segment going forward.
And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments and large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.
I'll now turn the call back over to Chris."

So we do expect PS&I gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year -- I think I mentioned in my prior comments, to end the year at approximately 21%.

This is a long-standing EPA site and related to one of our legacy businesses in Scottsdale, Arizona. And really, what it represents is, if you look at the $57 million, about $20 million is additive cost. But from a cost perspective per year, in 2019, the additive cost is about $800,000. So the cost is really related to an extension beyond 2039 of monitoring that we need to do in Scottsdale, both groundwater and vapor intrusion monitoring. There's -- and then there's also a change in the discount rate that we used. So from a cash perspective, you shouldn't expect any different cash-out position anywhere in the near term.

So first of all, I think the first part of the question was related to big deals. Obviously, in Greg's intro, we talked about the State of Florida, which is, frankly, the biggest statewide project. It was a legacy Harris customer that we've been awarded. So we have that, and we have multiple other state-wide upgrades that we're in pursuit of. The LMR project business remains -- frankly, it's very robust. I would tether that comment to the fact that the team's executed very well with the portfolio that we've got a couple new product introductions. We have not announced the new product yet, but both from command center software, we've got a lot on the horizon there, but also some nice things here in 2019 related to our devices as well. So the sales team is very poised, very excited to take that to market. But -- so I think the culmination of the market driver, state and local revenue, receipts being up, very good federal budget situation for us, coupled with new product on the horizon, it's exciting times, I think, in the Project 25 and PCR business."
