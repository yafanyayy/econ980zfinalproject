We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3%, both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company. For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandise and categories, formats and regions and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter, so we are well-positioned as we begin the year. 
Sam's Club comps improved to 2.4%. And in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of the slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as created a healthier long term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted gross. Overall, we finished the year with e-commerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we expect e-commerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the new year with about 40% growth for the year. We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by 4 key objectives: make every day easier for busy families; change how we work; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer. 
We are accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more. By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process. We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets. 
It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. 
Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S. 
We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training. Finally, we are always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve. 
In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We also continued to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States. 
Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We are becoming more efficient and is contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year. Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future. In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of over 250,000 associates. So our stores are executing better. We're innovating more, we're lowering prices and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. As I mentioned earlier, this has also been a year of good progress in e-commerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com and customers continued to love online grocery pickup. We're expanding our tests of same-day and next day delivery and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs. 
Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor, will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our e-commerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward. The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets. 
Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well-positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. e-commerce growth number. 
Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made the decision close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future. Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business. 
We also took additional steps to recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs. In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity and buying rules. The strategy continues to come to life and we are already seeing progress. 
Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with e-commerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience. 
As we mentioned at our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first party e-commerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places. So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strength to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about costs and capital, and we're acting faster as a company, but are pushing to increase our speed. 
Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?"
313055,420346392,1395601,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone.

We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively. Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet of healthier business. In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs with greater emphasis on comp sales and e-commerce growth. We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. 
A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release. 
During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates. 
Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leverage expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and strong working capital improvements continued. 
Now let's move onto the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. 
International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex. Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately 2/3 of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing e-commerce business. The remaining 1/3 was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first party e-commerce business. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some, but not to the extent of this quarter. Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%. 
Let's move on to U.S. e-commerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect e-commerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the new year with about 40% growth for the year. 
Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units. During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2-year stack was the best in 8 years and e-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment. 
Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working and customers are responding. 
International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets and results at Walmex were particularly strong. Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion. It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind in the sales of about $400 million when compared to last year. From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year. 
Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from International business, and we feel good about the year ahead. Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by a traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. E-commerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp. Also in the e-commerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from samsclub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time. 
I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape and our largest markets remain generally consistent. You will recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly -- primarily as a result of tax reform. 
Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global bended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we paid outside of the U.S. 
In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation. Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law, but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation. 
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced the $20 billion share repurchase program back in October. We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long-term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long-term. 
We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll loo to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and e-commerce to better position the company for the future, we'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value. 
At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: A wind down of the first party e-commerce business in Brazil; the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S.; and a decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. 
These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to  total sales growth. So I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance. Let's first talk about Brazil e-commerce. We expect a headwind of sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down. As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year. The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October. 
As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps, excluding fuel and tobacco, should range between 3% and 4%. And flat to negative 1% when, including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. 
Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October. On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business and we remain pleased with the progress. 
As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year adjusted for the discrete items. Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October. 
Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. 
Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted. We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year. There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And I'd be happy along with Doug to take your questions."

As we came around the fourth quarter, looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we expect at a lower growth rate. The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough [ cube ] that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items and our basic in-stock for e-commerce suffered as a result.

As we've talked about before, there's a number of things that impact gross margin, price shrink, transportation expenses, all of that go into that. And so as we've said before, it's tough to look at gross margin quarter-to-quarter. I think you have to look at it on a longer base. And what I said in my comment is that we expect the next year's decrease won't be what we saw in the fourth quarter. And if you look at where we've guided, operating income and the comment we made about slightly leveraging expenses, you can kind of back into what -- a bit of what we're expecting from a gross margin perspective. So we do take into consideration the mix of the business. We'll continue to be aggressive, but thoughtful on pricing. Where we invest, how we invest, both in stores and e-commerce, but we'll be thoughtful about those investments."

I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in e-commerce as we go month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in e-commerce this year than we did last year. But generally speaking, we think it would be about the same level of losses. Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there and where -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through. As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing a higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar. Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice. And that choice was made before we made the acquisition. I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where do we've positioned it. But our thoughts before we bought it, that basically confirmed it, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling in some cases some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com. So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities. Whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business and growing it will be a priority."

This is Doug, I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic is up, we're in really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong. Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned, we're seeing more traction improvement in that part of the business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex Canada and even in the U.K., which is a big part of our International business has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's a vital strategic importance. So now let's click to e-commerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food e-commerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food e-commerce business, and that's what we're doing. Learning how to pick in-store enables online grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year. Now let's click to the part of the e-commerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into e-commerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an e-commerce basket, not just selling eaches like telling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money but driving baskets on e-commerce is. So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands before increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand. So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment. It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue."

As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis point you mentioned was total company and there is about 1/3 of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil e-commerce shut down and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was about 1/3 of that was one time type items. In the U.S. again, there's just so many things that go into margin in the quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price. As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years. And so now we're 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."

It's one of our big levers and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after. And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable. And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic and we'll manage margins just like we do in parts of the P&L a quarter at a time, balancing short-term and long-term."

As the shape of a basket changes, food and nonfood and it goes up, and remember Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of e-commerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you drop basket economics rather than eaches. So part of what we are trying to build with e-commerce, and I think you see it frankly in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches is that we are really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key profitability."

And you can imagine for competitive reasons, we're not going to get a lot of things that we plan to do. We'll be talking about those as we go throughout the year. We mentioned, we think EPS growth will be pretty consistent throughout the year quarter-by-quarter. There could be a quarter or two where we make an investment that's different than the other quarters. And if that's the case, we would talk about that when we release earnings. But right now, I don't anticipate major changes quarter-to-quarter."

We're only giving guidance for this year coming forward. We did leverage expenses. Excluding discrete items for the year, leverage got better as we went throughout the year. So I am optimistic about the expense leverage that we're seeing in the business, particularly in International and Walmart U.S. stores. And I expect that we'll continue to see that progress. So that gives us -- we've always talked about that being better with expenses gives us more flexibility and more ways in which to hit the P&L that we would like to and do what we want to do for our customers. So that's the only guidance we're going to give, will be this year on operating income. On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices, fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In those last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter."

If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn and basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those, that's going to help us with speed, it's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape.

As you think about price investments in-store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods that are high turn price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way, the supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We are not cutting short the e-commerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in e-commerce. There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on e-commerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically. As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms that we'll use. Depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores, in particular. Our online grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score. And we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good for delivery as it is for pick up. So we've got some things to learn there. And it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience."

At that moment time, we had been through all of the 11,600 plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, maybe Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time. We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking about it is, we make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused -- focusing on building an e-commerce business, that's still underway, obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club. We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there.

We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company. 
For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year. Sam's Club comps improved to -- 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth. Overall, we finished the year with e-commerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter.  Looking ahead, we expect e-commerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the new year with about 40% growth for the year. 
We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by 4 key objectives: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer. We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more. 
By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process. We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets. 
It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S. 
We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training. Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve. 
In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States. 
Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year. 
Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future. In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates.  So our stores are executing better. We're innovating more, we're lowering prices, and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. 
As I mentioned earlier, this has also been a year of good progress in e-commerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs. 
Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our e-commerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward. 
The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets. Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. e-commerce growth number. 
Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future. Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business. 
We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs. In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress. 
Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with e-commerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience. 
As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our -- on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party e-commerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places. So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed. 
Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?"
313055,420346392,1395739,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal",2043,"All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively. Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business. In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and e-commerce growth. We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release. 
During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates. 
Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. 
We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued. 
Now let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex. 
Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately 2/3 of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing e-commerce business. The remaining 1/3 was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party e-commerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter. 
Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%. 
Let's move on to U.S. e-commerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect e-commerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the new year, with about 40% growth for the year. 
Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units. During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2-year stack was the best in 8 years, and e-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment. 
Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding. 
International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong. Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion.  It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year. 
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year...  Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead. 
Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. E-commerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp. Also in the e-commerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time. 
I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent. You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly -- primarily as a result of tax reform. 
Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S. 
In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation. Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation. 
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October. We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term. 
We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and e-commerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value. 
At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind down of the first-party e-commerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance. 
Let's first talk about Brazil e-commerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down. As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year. 
The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October. 
As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. 
Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October. On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress. 
As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items. Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October. 
Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted. We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year. There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions."

As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we've expected a lower growth rate. The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for e-commerce suffered as a result. So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue.

Maybe some thoughts on where you might be investing in price. And also, I think the guidance, Brett, was that gross margin rate would be down less in fiscal '19. So if e-commerce is going to reaccelerate to a sort of 40% type growth rate, why wouldn't we see more pressure on gross margin?"

Like do you feel as good as you have always felt in terms of the prospects for Jet and this is just pure math, it just makes more sense to go after the Walmart.com customer?"

It'",370,"Yes. Karen, this is Doug. Great questions. I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in e-commerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in e-commerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses. Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through. As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar. Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition. I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com. So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority."

I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. sup",468,"Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong. Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance. So now let's click to e-commerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food e-commerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food e-commerce business, and that's what we're doing. Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year. Now let's click to the part of the e-commerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into e-commerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an e-commerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on e-commerce is. So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand. So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment. It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue."

So it was -- about 1/3 of that was onetime type items. In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price. As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."

So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after. And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable. And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long term."

As the shape of a basket changes, food and nonfood, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of e-commerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches. So part of what we're trying to build with e-commerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability."

We're only giving guidance for this year coming forward. We did leverage expenses. Excluding discrete items for the year, leverage got better as we went throughout the year. So I am optimistic about the expense leverage that we're seeing in the business, particularly in International and Walmart U.S. stores, and I expect that we'll continue to see that progress. So that gives us -- we've always talked about that being better with expenses gives us more flexibility and more ways in which to hit the P&L that we would like to and do what we want to do for our customers. So that's the only guidance we're going to give, is we'll be this, this year on operating income. On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices -- fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In this last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter."

I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side. So I think there's more room to go. I won't quantify what I think that could be, but I do believe working capital can continue to be a source of cash for Walmart going forward."

So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here. If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today."

As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way. The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the e-commerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in e-commerce. There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on e-commerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically. As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular. Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience."

I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those. At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time. We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an e-commerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club. We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway."

We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company. 
For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year. Sam's Club comps improved to -- 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth. Overall, we finished the year with e-commerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter.  Looking ahead, we expect e-commerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the new year with about 40% growth for the year. 
We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by 4 key objectives: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer. We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more. 
By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process. We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets. 
It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S. 
We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training. Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve. 
In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States. 
Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year. 
Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future. In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates.  So our stores are executing better. We're innovating more, we're lowering prices, and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. 
As I mentioned earlier, this has also been a year of good progress in e-commerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs. 
Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our e-commerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward. 
The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets. Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. e-commerce growth number. 
Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future. Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business. 
We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs. In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress. 
Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with e-commerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience. 
As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our -- on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party e-commerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places. So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed. 
Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?"
313055,420346392,1395892,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal",2043,"All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively. Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business. In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and e-commerce growth. We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release. 
During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates. 
Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. 
We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued. 
Now let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex. 
Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately 2/3 of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing e-commerce business. The remaining 1/3 was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party e-commerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter. 
Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%. 
Let's move on to U.S. e-commerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect e-commerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the new year, with about 40% growth for the year. 
Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units. During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2-year stack was the best in 8 years, and e-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment. 
Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding. 
International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong. Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion.  It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year. 
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year.  Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead. 
Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. E-commerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp. Also in the e-commerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time. 
I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent. You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly -- primarily as a result of tax reform. 
Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S. 
In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation. Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation. 
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October. We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term. 
We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and e-commerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value. 
At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind down of the first-party e-commerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance. 
Let's first talk about Brazil e-commerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down. As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year. 
The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October. 
As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. 
Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October. On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress. 
As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items. Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October. 
Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted. We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year. There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions."

First of all, I would say that, as we try to communicate in our remarks, most of that was expected and planned. As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we've expected a lower growth rate. The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for e-commerce suffered as a result. So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue. Most of this was planned and in our numbers."

I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in e-commerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in e-commerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses. Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through. As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar. Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition. I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com. So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority."

I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. sup",468,"Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong. Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance. So now let's click to e-commerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food e-commerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food e-commerce business, and that's what we're doing. Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year. Now let's click to the part of the e-commerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into e-commerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an e-commerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on e-commerce is. So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand. So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment. It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue."

As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis points you mentioned was total company, and there is about 1/3 of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil e-commerce shutdown and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was -- about 1/3 of that was onetime type items. In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price. As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."

So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after. And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable. And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long term."

As the shape of a basket changes, food and nonfood, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of e-commerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches. So part of what we're trying to build with e-commerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability."

So that's the only guidance we're going to give, is we'll be this, this year on operating income. On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices -- fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In this last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter."

Some of the technology that we've talked about and investments will continue to lead to easier ways for our associates to move goods, stock goods. So all of that helps, and all of that matters. I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side. So I think there's more room to go. I won't quantify what I think that could be, but I do believe working capital can continue to be a source of cash for Walmart going forward."

And Marc and the team are learning how to mirror inventory in certain places to improve customer service levels and to lower cost. So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here. If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today."

As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way. The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the e-commerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in e-commerce. There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on e-commerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically. As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular. Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience."

I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those. At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time. We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an e-commerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club. We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway."

We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business.

We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company. 
For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year. Sam's Club comps improved to -- 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth. Overall, we finished the year with e-commerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter.  Looking ahead, we expect e-commerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the new year with about 40% growth for the year. 
We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by 4 key objectives: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer. We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more. 
By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process. We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets. 
It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S. 
We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training. Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve. 
In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States. 
Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year. 
Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future. In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates.  So our stores are executing better. We're innovating more, we're lowering prices, and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. 
As I mentioned earlier, this has also been a year of good progress in e-commerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs. 
Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our e-commerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward. 
The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets. Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. e-commerce growth number. 
Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future. Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business. 
We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs. In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress. 
Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with e-commerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience. 
As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our -- on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party e-commerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places. So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed. 
Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?"
313055,420346392,1396518,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2018",2018-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal",2040,"All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively. Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business. In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and e-commerce growth. We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release. 
During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates. 
Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. 
We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued. 
Now let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex. 
Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately 2/3 of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing e-commerce business. The remaining 1/3 was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party e-commerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter. 
Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%. 
Let's move on to U.S. e-commerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect e-commerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the new year, with about 40% growth for the year. 
Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units. During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2-year stack was the best in 8 years, and e-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment. 
Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding. 
International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong. Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion.  It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year. 
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year.  Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead. 
Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. E-commerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp. Also in the e-commerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time. 
I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent. You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly -- primarily as a result of tax reform. 
Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S. 
In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation. Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation. 
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October. We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term. 
We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and e-commerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value. 
At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind-down of the first-party e-commerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance. 
Let's first talk about Brazil e-commerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind-down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind-down. As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year. 
The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October. 
As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. 
Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October. On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress. 
As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items. Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October. 
Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted. We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year. There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions."

First of all, I would say that, as we try to communicate in our remarks, most of that was expected and planned. As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for some time now, we've expected a lower growth rate. The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for e-commerce suffered as a result. So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue.

And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar. Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition. I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com. So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority."

I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. sup",468,"Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong. Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance. So now let's click to e-commerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food e-commerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food e-commerce business, and that's what we're doing. Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year. Now let's click to the part of the e-commerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into e-commerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an e-commerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on e-commerce is. So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand. So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment. It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue."

So it was -- about 1/3 of that was onetime type items. In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price. As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."

So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after. And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable. And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long term."

As the shape of a basket changes, food and nonfood, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of e-commerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches. So part of what we're trying to build with e-commerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability."

We've got a big apparel business. It has been growing, but we have even more opportunity to grow it in store. And then online, there are numerous opportunities for us to build private brands, leverage the DNVBs of the world like Bonobos and ModCloth and maybe more in the future and attract other brands to both Walmart and Jet that will help us drive our apparel business and manage the mix.

I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side. So I think there's more room to go.

So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here. If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today."

As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way. The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the e-commerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in e-commerce. There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on e-commerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically. As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular. Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience."

I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those. At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time. We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an e-commerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club. We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway."

This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Shirish Gupta from our IR team. Hopefully, you've had some time to review our press release this morning along with our other Q3 earnings documents. I'll hit on some key points and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
As a reminder, our Q3 earnings press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentations are available on the Investor page of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. We may make forward-looking statements during this call. Please review the Q3 earnings presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.
In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing a strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. e-commerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club e-commerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance executable from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full-year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Kshitij Gupta from our IR team. 
Hopefully, you've had some time to review our press release this morning along with our other Q3 earnings documents. I'll hit on some key points and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
As a reminder, our Q3 earnings press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentations are available on the Investor page of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. We may make forward-looking statements during this call. Please review the Q3 earnings presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.
In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. e-commerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club e-commerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance ex-fuel from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. 
Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Kshitij Gupta from our IR team. 
Hopefully, you've had some time to review our press release this morning along with our other Q3 earnings documents. I'll hit on some key points and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
As a reminder, our Q3 earnings press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentations are available on the Investor page of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. We may make forward-looking statements during this call. Please review the Q3 earnings presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.
In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. e-commerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club e-commerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance ex-fuel from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. 
Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

And as we think about next year, is maybe there's some more pressure from the tariffs, from some of the discretionary categories. Is -- I guess, do you think it's an advantage to kind of maybe balance the 2 where there's maybe not some pressure on the food and grocery categories, but maybe some more on the other side? And I guess, just how you're thinking about that into 2019?"

This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Kshitij Gupta from our IR team. 
Hopefully, you've had some time to review our press release this morning along with our other Q3 earnings documents. I'll hit on some key points and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
As a reminder, our Q3 earnings press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentations are available on the Investor page of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. We may make forward-looking statements during this call. Please review the Q3 earnings presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.
In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. eCommerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club eCommerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance ex-fuel from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. 
Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. eCommerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club eCommerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance ex-fuel from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. 
Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Kshitij Gupta from our IR team. Hopefully, you've had some time",587,"Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings. This is Dan Binder, and I'm joined today by Kary Brunner, James Mann, Michael Brigance and Kshitij Gupta from our IR team. 
Hopefully, you've had some time to review our press release this morning along with our other Q3 earnings documents. I'll hit on some key points and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
As a reminder, our Q3 earnings press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentations are available on the Investor page of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. We may make forward-looking statements during this call. Please review the Q3 earnings presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.
In terms of key takeaways, we had good quarter with strength in many areas of the business. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue was up 2.4% or $2.9 billion year-over-year and exceeded plan. On a reported basis, this was just under $125 billion in revenue and currency negatively affected the top line by about $1.2 billion and operating profit by nearly $60 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 per share and that was about an 8% increase over last year. From a GAAP perspective, we posted $0.58.
Now let me give you a little bit of color on sales. We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the U.S., up 3.4%, and on a 2-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back quarters with 2-year stack comps above 6%, so we're pleased with the momentum in the business.
At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I'm pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results, and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don't break out grocery comps specifically, I will tell you that it was the best 2-year stack comp in nearly 9 years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category, and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh.
As you also saw in today's release, U.S. eCommerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year. We also continue to see good top line results for International and Sam's Club. 9 of the 10 international markets reported positive comps, led by Mexico. In Sam's Club, we saw reported strong comp store sales growth of 3.2% excluding fuel, and 5.7% excluding fuel and tobacco. Sam's Club eCommerce sales grew 32%, and we continue to be pleased with membership trends.
Lastly, as detailed in our release, we did raise our Walmart U.S. comp store sales guidance ex-fuel from around 3% to at least 3%. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, which was raised from our previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.80. 
Just in terms of a reminder, I'd like to remind you that we will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2020 earnings releases -- release dates on our IR website.
So with that, I'm happy to open up the call to your questions. Operator, if we could get started. Thanks."

We have seen some cost input increases but, similar to last quarter, that's largely been offset by price investment which, as you can see in our gross margin, continues to be a factor, in fact, the leading factor for gross margin pressure. The reason for ticket improvement, I think, is a function of a few things: one, Online Grocery continues to grow rapidly and that is a significantly higher ticket than the average; second, eCommerce also continues to grow rapidly and that is a higher ticket. And then even if you look within the store, fresh is higher ticket. That's been a leading comp category within grocery.

We haven't broken that out specifically, nor have we broken out the specific level of impact that we would expect, but obviously, the world -- many companies are experiencing it. The key takeaway, I think, should be that we're going to manage the margins through this period. The merchants have been in these situations before. We are going to maintain our price gaps with the market, but I think ultimately, it's a case-by-case situation. There's situations where we'll be able to take cost out to offset. So it's not a -- I couldn't describe it in a really simple form for you, but I think what I'd want you to leave the call with is that we're going to be able to manage through it.
