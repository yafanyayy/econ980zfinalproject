We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0.

We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0. As you may have seen, we hit the ground running in early January with new organizational announcements. We're adding well-respected outside leaders to help us intensify our drive for growth and bring a fresh perspective. 
Hopefully, you all know the number of new initiatives to further my 3 key themes for 2018: integration, collaboration and innovation. If we go back to our investor conference in December, we spoke about our focus in 2018 on better integrating the enterprise. This is a company with a lot of potential and a lot of work to be done. We are actively at work improving our processes, streamlining our procedures, deepening our L3 [ 65 ] initiatives, which is our improvement focus and, in some areas, moving and changing our people for improved growth and accountability.
We're positioning the company for higher margins this year, and at the same time, we're investing in new processes as well as getting more strategic on our technology road map. It's important to push open the aperture for more top line growth in the years ahead. 
I believe and our segment presidents believe we can be doing better across the board, and we're raising expectations to achieve that. I'm a big believer in continuous improvement, and we have embarked on a number of internal initiatives. 
Before we discuss our results, I want to touch quickly on the Defense budget. The recent vote to end the shutdown and from the government for 3 weeks show some progress, but it is still temporary. Like the rest of the industry, we are concerned about how the continuing resolution impacts the U.S. Military's ability to plan and execute its mission. We will leverage our strength of agility and adaptability to support our customers as they navigate in this uncertain budget environment. We are watching the matter closely, and our guidance assumes that we don't have a protracted CR.
In terms of our financials. We had a good quarter and ended the year with increased sales, improved margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Our 2017 EPS and margins could have been higher, but we continue to make decisions to increase our efficiency and profitability by integrating and restructuring our businesses. 
As I've said before, we'll take a short-term onetime charge in exchange for recurring long-term profitable earnings growth. Ralph will explain some of the fourth quarter decisions in a few minutes. 
We entered the year with a goal of growing sales for the first time since the turn of the decade, and we accomplished that goal. I will also add that with the new tax law, we had a onetime gain of almost $80 million and we will have a lower tax provision in the future. We're one of the few companies that recorded a gain from the tax reform due to our various tax planning strategies. 
We also increased our strong cash position, giving us the ability to grow our business through acquisitions and various organic growth initiatives. This is and will always be a priority for L3. 
Free cash flow and cash conversion are important metrics to me and the leadership team. It's a big part of how we evaluate our performance, and we'll be discussing it regularly in our conversations with you. At the same time, we are investing to drive more top line and earnings growth in the years ahead. We know where we're headed, and we're determined to become a nontraditional [indiscernible]. We have the resources to execute this vision, and we will invest in new technologies that are vital to the warfighter and our commercial aviation customers. 
As we began 2018, our leadership team is energized and we're starting from a unique position. We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lien corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. 
To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strength. And we're pushing agility, technology and rapid adaptability deeper into our markets. We believe, and the world around our shows, that the future belongs not to the biggest but to the fastest. 
Operationally, we are integrating our businesses and internal systems to increase productivity and accelerate information flow. This will lead to more timely decisions and increased profitability. We are intensifying the focus on collaboration by bundling capabilities into total solutions as well as collaborating on technology development and strategic pursuits. 
In addition, we are investing in areas that are aligned with the new National Defense strategy. Across L3, we are developing advanced technologies in important growth markets to enhance our leadership position, including ISR, protected communications, sensors, night vision and airport security. We also have affordable and innovative solutions in both commercial and military pilot training. 
As we execute on our vision for L3, it is clear that some capabilities are no longer a good fit and would be better in another company. We've begun the sale process for Vertex, and we've seen a significant amount of interest in the business. We expect to receive initial indications of interest before the end of February and remain on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of this year. By divesting it, we'll enable the Aerospace Systems' leadership team to redirect our focus into areas where it is best suited to grow. We continually evaluate the portfolio based on market trends and outlook. 
Structurally, our business leaders have been working hard at secularizing our divisions. By integrating and optimizing our sectors, we are creating businesses that have critical mass and are aligned with customer priorities. 
We're also taking steps to improve how we market ourselves internationally. At the beginning of this year, we established 3 new boards in Australia, Canada and the U.K. These boards will help our focus on growing more international business, strengthen customer relationships and support the thousands of employees who are working every day to meet the needs of our customers in these regions. 
Looking ahead, we have prioritized a dozen or so countries, primarily in the Middle East and Asia, and we're [indiscernible] strategies for doing more business in each. 
Let's now turn to talent as I'm putting the right people in the right places. We've made some great additions to the management team. Sean [indiscernible] has joined us as our Vice President of Strategic Advanced Programs and Technologies. Sean was a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was one of the most respected leaders in the Pentagon. We also brought on [ Pat O'Reilly ]as our Vice President of corporate engineering. Pat was the Director of the missile defense agency and will help us expand our system engineering capabilities. John [indiscernible] recently joined us as the new Vice President of Business Development and Marketing. John is a well recognized expert in commercial aviation and will help us better connect with customers in that market. Just last night, John was recognized as the face of aviation at the Dublin Airline Conference. So congratulations to John. 
And finally, we recently promoted Andy [indiscernible] to lead our Communication Systems segment. Many of you got a chance to meet him at the investor conference, and he has done a great job running several businesses within Communication Systems and has consistently delivered strong operational and financial performance while maintaining a focus on our customers. And he succeeds John [indiscernible], who has been with L3 since the beginning and was instrumental in growing that segment into a multibillion-dollar business. After 44 years in the industry, John will be retiring, and we wish him well. 
Let me now talk about our cash deployment priorities. As I noted earlier, we are approaching R&D in a more strategic way, by aligning it with our technology road map and investing in the most promising technology. We will continue to spend about 3% of our revenues on R&D.
Turning now to M&A. We are stepping up activity in attractive growth areas and strengthening areas of strategic significance for us. We invested over $300 million in 8 acquisitions in 2017. Right now, we have about 20 companies of varying sizes in our pipeline. I think it is reasonable to say we can spend $1 billion a year in M&A. 
Moving forward, we are deploying most of our cash to build the company through M&A, and we will buy back shares to offset share creep as a secondary use of our cash. 
In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and professionalism of our employees. We have a terrific team at headquarters in across all segments that is executing on our strategy. We're embarking on a number of changes to the growth -- to grow the company over the long term, and we'll continue to improve our margins and deliver organic growth, quality earnings and strong free cash flow. 
In addition, we are going to accomplish this by keeping our eye on the ball, being customer-centric and never being satisfied as we pursue excellence every day.
Ralph will now take you through the financial performance and outlook, and then we'll take some questions."
93538,549814502,1374072,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2018",2018-01-25,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling as reclassified to be",1132,"Thanks, Chris. I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling as reclassified to be discontinued operations. 
Reviewing the fourth quarter, our results were generally in line with our outlook with strong orders, plus higher free cash flow and favorable tax items, mostly due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Admittedly, there are a few moving parts in our results, including the Vertex reclassification to discontinued operations, so we added a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from our midpoint guidance to our actual fourth quarter results in our website financial charts. 
So if you look at Page 5 of our web charts, you will see that our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.34 and it exceeded the midpoint guidance by $1.12. The largest component of our higher EPS was a tax reform gain of $0.99. We also had a tax benefit of $0.38 from realigning our foreign legal entities. Partially offsetting these tax gains was charges of $0.24, mostly for new business integration and restructuring actions, which we took to further improve our core structure.
Fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $2.6 billion. Regarding the negative sales growth, you should recall that our accounting calendar added an extra week to our first quarter, which reversed in the fourth quarter. And everything else being equal, this lowered our growth rate by about 6 percentage points. Fourth quarter sales were in the high end of our outlook. Within the segments, DoD sales were solid, including the start of the new Compass Call recap program in Aerospace Systems and higher classified contract and airborne datalink sales at Communication Systems. Soft market conditions continue to weigh on aviation security and Electronic Systems and commercial SATCOM and Communication Systems. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.2%, declining [ 50 ] basis points compared to 2016 fourth quarter because of an increase in restructuring charges.
As we previously explained, we are decisively pursuing our integration strategy. Our fourth quarter results included business integration and restructuring charges of $39 million, which lowered margin by [ 150 ] basis points. Almost $30 million of those restructuring charges were not anticipated in our last guidance update. 
The components of the $30 million are a $12 million asset write-down on our property containing one of our IR detective boundaries that we will consolidate; a $4 million pension curtailment charge; a $4 million of severance expansions to combine our 2 Canadian business in aerospace; and approximately $10 million for incremental costs on in-process restructuring activities, primarily the traveling [indiscernible] business consolidation to Communication Systems.
The IR foundry consolidation is a new restructuring action in Sensor Systems, which we expect to generate annual cost savings of about $9 million beginning toward the end of 2019. 
Regarding the pension curtailment, at our investor conference, Chris and I commented that we were evaluating our pension plans. And since then, we've decided to freeze substantially all of our salary pension plans effective January [ 1 ], 2009, to no longer accrue annual service rate. We expect this action to reduce our pension expense by at least $25 million in 2019. 
Communication Systems margin was 7.8%. And excluding the $15 million of restructuring expenses there, it would have been 10.3%, slightly below our 2017 margin estimate. Communication Systems margin was also affected by the softness in the commercial satellite market, which cost lower overhead absorption and inventory provisioning in the space and power sector. 
Sensor Systems margin was 10.9%. And without the foundry consolidation charge, its margin would have been 13.6% for the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was robust at [ $347 ] million, and it benefited from higher receivable collections. Orders were also very healthy at $2.7 billion, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.06 in the fourth quarter and 1.04 for the full year 2017. 
Moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased our EPS midpoint by [ $0.67 ] to $9.40. The EPS increase is due to lower estimated taxes with a tax rate now of 20% arising from the U.S. tax reform, which adds $0.80 to EPS, partially offset by [ $15 ] million of a higher estimated pension expenses for 2018 based on the final December 31 pension assumptions, which subtracts $0.13 from EPS. Adjusting to exclude the 2017 tax reform gain, we expect 2018 EPS to grow [ about ] 11% over 2017. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains just under $10 billion with expected growth of 4% over 2017. We maintained all of our 2018 segment guidance ranges, and we now expect the growth over 2017 of 7% for Electronics, 2% for Communications, 12% for Sensors. And this growth is partially offset by a 4% decline at Aerospace.
Our updated operating margin guidance of 11.2% subtracts the higher pension expense, and we expect 2018 margin to increase 40 basis points versus 2017 with operating income growing 8%.
We also adjusted our 2018 margin guidance for 3 of our segments for the higher pension expense, and we now expect margins of 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11.1% for Communications, and we increased Sensor Systems margin by 30 basis points to 11.8% unrelated to the pension expense.
Regarding free cash flow, we increased our estimate by $35 million to [ $900 ] million due to lower taxes, partially offset by an expectation of fewer receivable collections. 
Regarding capital allocation, after paying dividends, as Chris explained, we continue to favor acquisitions. During 2017, we invested [ $317 ] million on acquisitions. We also repurchased $89 million of our stock during the fourth quarter and [ $180 ] million for the full year 2017. We ended with a cash balance of [ $662 ] million and expected to increase $1.2 billion by the end of 2018 after paying more dividends and repurchasing $300 million of our stock in 2018. So we will have plenty of firepower to make acquisitions.
Taking a quick look at the 2018 first quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion with operating margin in low 10% range and diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had a very solid 2017. Compared to 2016, we grew orders 5%, sales 4%, operating income 7%, EPS 20% and free cash flow 3%. We also increased margins 30 basis points to 10.7%. We remain focused on continuously improving our operational financial performance. In 2018, we will grow order sales and all the profit metrics, and we're also strategically executing our disciplined growth capital allocation plan and have ample liquidity to support those plans. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

But on the annual bonus program, we're making changes in 2018 on a couple of fronts. First of all, instead of being solely focused on the earnings and cash metric, we're adding a third metric, which I'll be proposing to our Compensation Committee and board in a few weeks, and that is one of organic growth. So of the team will all be compensated on earnings, cash and growth. And then secondarily, we're going to have a mixed bonus where you will be compensated not only for how your entity does but the entity above you, which will drive collaboration.

And we're on a path to get to 12%. And as I continue to say and will continue to say, we're looking at long-term growth. We'll take restructuring charges. We'll take charges for layoffs. We'll take charges for selling facilities at a loss, and we will lower our earnings, as I told you, in the October time frame to increase R&D as we have in Sensor Systems for opportunity.

There's really 2 parts to it, the -- which I don't want to downplay. The first part is the nontraditional part, which I think aligns very well with the National Security strategy and some of the initiatives that Secretary Gordon and other in acquisition form and it's really, I think, one of our key differentiators when we're talking about agility and innovation and speed to market. So that's the nontraditional piece. The 6 prime, of course, is having us prime more work or move up the foodchain or bundle systems subsystems, subsystems into products and such. So that's kind of what I laid out, and that's what the team has embraced. 
But relative to service by service, what I said internally and publicly, aligns with the strategy our nation on this disaggregation. As much as I'd love to have a multibillion-dollar bomber or multibillion-dollar submarine or a multibillion-dollar ship, we're not going to have that. What we're going to do is support those in our unmanned vehicles are a good example. So when we look at the Navy, we have 3 acquisitions last year to really get into a new market of unmanned undersea vehicles. And by all accounts, that's off to a great start. It's still in development. The medians we're having in DC are very favorable, and I think there are hundreds, if not thousands, of UUV potential in the years and decades to come. So that's an example on the Navy strategy. With the Army, there's a whole push on soldier as a system. As you know, there's a whole Army modernization uptick, and I think we're going to have some progress there that we can talk about in the months ahead. And of course, with the Air Force, while we're platform agnostic because we don't have a platform. I think when you look at some of the things we're doing in Aero, there's some great opportunities, whether it's C130-amp, there's some classify things we're doing. They're some things we're doing for the new presidential craft. At the end of the day, we have, I think, the best ISR capabilities out there, and that's an area we're going to continue to grow. And we do have some unmanned air vehicles, probably like everybody else that they can't talk about. But that's the vision. And of course, sticking with the Air Force, the pilot training is an important part, and we made an acquisition a year ago. And I think we're the only company that actually does live training for the Air Force to get the pilots into the queue. So that's how we've laid it out. It's one of the things that [indiscernible] has been spent a lot of time on Chief Strategy Officer and we have very unique and specific strategies that we're developing and implementing."

We're not happy, as I said and Mike said even before I got here about where we are in Aero, it's a tough market. It's been shrinking, and it's a key year. The main focus is on Waco. We need to get more base in there, and we have a bid for the [ P8 ] depo award. We expect 2 awards hopefully in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter. And our goal is to get one of those 2 awards. And as you would imagine, this would replace the [ P3 ] work that finished a couple of years ago. So strategically, I'll keep an eye on [ P8 ]. It's a slow ramp, but it will give us the base that is so important on these capital intense facilities. 
The one I'm excited about is later in this year, C130-amp, and this the avionics upgrade program for the C130s. There's 3 or 4 competitors, probably guess who they are. And we've invested in some new avionic packages. They're flying quite well on the C130s, and it's a big cockpit upgrade. It's in our sweet spot, and the proposal is in. We'll know more in the fourth quarter. And I'm sure we'll go through the normal fee process. And then we have a classified program that's pretty exciting. So I feel like we have opportunities in Waco. We have a couple of big proposals then, and that's something you guys and I and more [indiscernible] and others will be watching closely. 
Greenville is kind of the bread-and-butter of Aero, and they have a great tradition in ISR capability. And we had every international award last year with the business jets. And there's 3 countries in the near term that we have discussions with, and those could be 2019 orders. And I think in the next 12 months, in addition to Mark and a few of us out personally be visiting those 3 countries to let them know of our corporate commitment and the importance of that. And it's really about, I think, in the near term fleet expansion. And ISR capabilities are so good. There's high demand to give them the [indiscernible] of the world, and it's really about short supply. So it's going to be a key year and a transitional year. We did mention that we're doing work on the new presidential aircraft for the mission Communication Systems. So there's a whole lot out there. 
And then I'll just say on M&A, and mentioned we did 8. We've got a pipeline here, everybody's focus on it. Every one of our core groups, core segments has something. And just like the last 2 years, they vary from niche bolt-on all the way up to what I'd like to say are more interesting acquisitions. But they're all under $0.5 billion, and there's a couple of international and mainly defense-related things. We get a lot of pilot training and security detection the last couple of years. So that's where we are. 
I guess if you want to email questions in, we seem some sort of technical difficulty. Just email them to Ivy would. And someone is actually handing me a new iPhone 10 here that says from [ Carter Copeland ]. I guess I need to be this out loud to myself and answer. 
Chris, here's a two-part question. $30 million of incremental restructuring [indiscernible] just in the month of December. Has been wondering specifically the pace with which you and the team are identifying opportunities, whether they be on cost, talent, process improvement, M&A, you name it. Can you provide insight on that perspective? And then secondly, the comment you made on the widening these aperture of technology, can you elaborate a little bit on what that means for both of your existing business as well as things you may want to acquire. This is kind of cool, like I read myself a question from -- I'm going to have to get myself an iPhone 10. It's actually a nice large screen. 
So the first question, I guess, is the pace. Well, if anything isn't obvious, I like to go fast, making likes to go fast. And I can assure you, we are going very fast. We had a 4 group presidents have been in the job less than a year. We were all together just 2 days this week going through our plans and strategies, and it's quicker is kind of our theme here. We're taking a cost on the structuring. We'll continue to do that. We have some big wins we need to get. But if they don't play out, we will have layoffs. We will restructure. We will move facilities. Clearly, we're working with local state to get to incentives where appropriate to help offset some of the cost, selling [indiscernible] for the gain out in California. We have another property real looking at. We got a lot of interest. We might do something creative there on a sale-leaseback. Everything's on the table. On the M&A side, we're not averse to joint ventures. Again, the National Security strategy talks a lot about partnerships around the globe, and I think we are in an incredibly unique position. We have great relationships in Europe and around the world who are trusted partner. And I think that's going to give us the strategic advantage that we seem to be well aligned. 
So on the M&A front, we did 8 last year. I have no issue doing 8 this year if they made sense, and we're looking at them. We have a couple with maybe we'll be able to close them in the next [ 60 ] days and we'll keep you abreast on that. But we're all moving very, very quickly. 
And then the second question can someone go back to the second question. It was about widening the aperture on the technology. That comes in a couple of forms. We -- there are some things we're looking at where we have to do a better job, maybe tying in with commercial companies and taking the technologies the market. Some of these markets we're looking at that our customers want are literally hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of investment. So we're looking at how we can partner with some companies out in the West and bring them in to the Department of Defense. And we're also looking at different customers. It's the same old -- some of these ISR capabilities are world-class, and we tend to focus on 1 or 2 customers, but there's other services in the U.S. and there's international countries, so we're going to be much more aggressive on that front. 
So historically, our group president, maybe myself, have been focused on the internal operations and the financials, which will continue, but we're going to be traveling the globe, we're going to meet with customers, we're going to meeting with members of Congress. And we're going to aggressively grow this company. Ralph?"

So with respect to discount rate, our discount rate has declined by about [ 60 ] basis points from the end of 2016 through the end of 2017. So the assumption that we're using is 3.87%. And what happened there is not only did we see a reduction in the treasury yields, but there's also been a tightening of credit spreads, especially across the investment grade bonds, and that's what's driving the reduction in discount rate. 
Fortunately, we have very good asset return in 2017, where the pension trust returned [ 15.5% ], which is much better than our assumption, which is just under 8%. And we'll be assuming the same tax return type assumption for 2018. So..."

Thanks, Jon. I think industry, including myself, has been in DC. Me recently, last week, the recurring question is what is the impact of the CR and I've taken the approach, which I believe is the biggest concern is the impact on our customers. And we all know the impact of the CR, the inability to have new start, the inability to ramp up. And clearly, there's a strategy that's requiring certain systems. And when you can provide them to the warfighter, I think they're the ones most harmed. And something that doesn't get a lot of attention in my opinion are the second, third and fourth year subs. There's a lot of small companies that we all work with, especially L3, and we find our self may be popping these guys up financially with cash. So the bread and butter of our country are these small innovative businesses. And I've told you, and think we're the federation of entrepreneurs, but much larger than some of these companies. And I don't think people understand and appreciate the impact they're having. So we're focus on supply chain and customer. And then ultimately, everything I'm reading is there should be a budget in mid-February, maybe it slips a week or 2. And once that happens, it will be a matter of how quickly everyone can get the new contracts on to the new orders on the contracts. So 7 straight years, I think the industry has probably figured it out. It's the obvious stuff, we're not hiring people. If we don't have business, we're trying to keep the R&D spend up. But it just puts a drag on the business. And we all know the situation around the world. The new strategy focuses more on near peers than the terrorist threat, and that has a different ramifications. There's a lot of discussion about having more agile military, and I like that because I believe we're an agile company. There's a lot of discussions about [indiscernible] and partnerships. So that's the start with the strategy and then ebb and flow just like the company into the budget. And we'll be prepared to keep with our customer and try to get stuff under contract as quickly as possible. So hopefully, that answers your question, Jon. And I think we'll take our last question next."

We do a lot of business supporting primes and other partners on systems that may or may not be deployed internationally. So we don't throw that number in. But no, I think all the trends are good. There's been discussions about accelerating the licensing and the export approval process. And I think this is an area where we set up the board. I'm looking at adding more talents in these international area. Because when you look at the portfolio and you look at the affordability and the agility of our systems, notwithstanding ISR is a larger one, there's a lot of neat. And a lot of these countries with tight budgets. I was recently in Singapore and Japan and Taiwan. We've got some of these trips coming up in a few months, and we can get under contract quickly and we have capabilities that they need. So things always take longer abroad, but I like the fact that the administration is aligning with industry and trying to get these things that are appropriate into our partners and allies hands. So that will be a focus of ours for 2018 as it was in 2017. And I'm just talking the military stuff. 
The commercial side, clearly, the pilot shortage is a global issue. We have trained centers in Taiwan and U.K. and are looking to expand elsewhere. So I feel real good about what we could do on the pilot training side internationally. In security and detection, as I told some people, Europe is ahead of the U.S., which I think is unfortunate and un-American to be lagging the rest of the world. So we're actually doing quite well in security and detection in Europe. And hopefully, our country catches up and gets some new systems in. 
So with that, I apologize for the technical glitch. I thought we did all right filling that space, Ralph?"

We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0. As you may have seen, we hit the ground running in early January with new organizational announcements. We're adding well-respected outside leaders to help us intensify our drive for growth and bring a fresh perspective. 
Hopefully, you all know the number of new initiatives to further my 3 key themes for 2018: integration, collaboration and innovation. If we go back to our investor conference in December, we spoke about our focus in 2018 on better integrating the enterprise. This is a company with a lot of potential and a lot of work to be done. We are actively at work improving our processes; streamlining our procedures; deepening our L365 initiatives, which is our continuous improvement focus; and in some areas, moving and changing our people for improved growth and accountability.
We're positioning the company for higher margins this year, and at the same time, we're investing in new processes as well as getting more strategic on our technology road map. It's important to push open the aperture for more top line growth in the years ahead. 
I believe and our segment presidents believe we can be doing better across the board, and we're raising expectations to achieve that. I'm a big believer in continuous improvement, and we have embarked on a number of internal initiatives. 
Before we discuss our results, I want to touch quickly on the Defense budget. The recent vote to end the shutdown and fund the government for 3 weeks shows some progress, but it is still temporary. Like the rest of the industry, we are concerned about how the continuing resolution impacts the U.S. Military's ability to plan and execute its mission. We will leverage our strength of agility and adaptability to support our customers as they navigate in this uncertain budget environment. We are watching the matter closely, and our guidance assumes that we don't have a protracted CR.
In terms of our financials. We had a good quarter and ended the year with increased sales, improved margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Our 2017 EPS and margins could have been higher, but we continue to make decisions to increase our efficiency and profitability by integrating and restructuring our businesses. As I've said before, we'll take a short-term onetime charge in exchange for recurring long-term profitable earnings growth. Ralph will explain some of the fourth quarter decisions in a few minutes. 
We entered the year with a goal of growing sales for the first time since the turn of the decade, and we accomplished that goal. I will also add that with the new tax law, we had a onetime gain of almost $80 million, and we will have a lower tax provision in the future. We're one of the few companies that recorded a gain from the tax reform due to our various tax planning strategies. 
We also increased our strong cash position, giving us the ability to grow our business through acquisitions and various organic growth initiatives. This is and will always be a priority for L3. 
Free cash flow and cash conversion are important metrics to me and the leadership team. It's a big part of how we evaluate our performance, and we'll be discussing it regularly in our conversations with you. At the same time, we are investing to drive more top line and earnings growth in the years ahead. We know where we're headed, and we're determined to become a nontraditional 6th Prime. We have the resources to execute this vision, and we will invest in new technologies that are vital to the warfighter and our commercial aviation customers. 
As we began 2018, our leadership team is energized, and we're starting from a unique position. We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lien corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strength. And we're pushing agility, technology and rapid adaptability deeper into our markets. We believe, and the world around us shows, that the future belongs not to the biggest but to the fastest. 
Operationally, we are integrating our businesses and internal systems to increase productivity and accelerate information flow. This will lead to more timely decisions and increased profitability. We are intensifying the focus on collaboration by bundling capabilities into total solutions as well as collaborating on technology development and strategic pursuits. In addition, we are investing in areas that are aligned with the new National Defense strategy. 
Across L3, we are developing advanced technologies in important growth markets to enhance our leadership position, including ISR, protected communications, sensors, night vision and airport security. We also have affordable and innovative solutions in both commercial and military pilot training. 
As we execute on our vision for L3, it is clear that some capabilities are no longer a good fit and would be better in another company. We've begun the sale process for Vertex, and we've seen a significant amount of interest in the business. We expect to receive initial indications of interest before the end of February and remain on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of this year. Divesting it will enable the Aerospace Systems' leadership team to redirect our focus into areas where it is best suited to grow. We continually evaluate the portfolio based on market trends and outlook. 
Structurally, our business leaders have been working hard at sectorizing our divisions. By integrating and optimizing our sectors, we are creating businesses that have critical mass and are aligned with customer priorities. 
We're also taking steps to improve how we market ourselves internationally. At the beginning to this year, we established 3 new boards in Australia, Canada and the U.K. These boards will help our focus on growing more international business, strengthen customer relationships and support the thousands of employees who are working every day to meet the needs of our customers in these regions. Looking ahead, we have prioritized a dozen or so countries, primarily in the Middle East and Asia, and we're tailoring strategies for doing more business in each. 
Let's now turn to talent as I'm putting the right people in the right places. We've made some great additions to the management team. Sean Stackley has joined us as our Vice President of Strategic Advanced Programs and Technologies. Sean was a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was one of the most respected leaders in the Pentagon. We also brought on Pat O'Reilly as our Vice President of Corporate Engineering. Pat was the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and will help us expand our system engineering capabilities. John Feren recently joined us as the new Vice President of Business Development and Marketing. John is a well-recognized expert in commercial aviation and will help us better connect with customers in that market. Just last night, John was recognized as the face of aviation at the Dublin Airline Conference. So congratulations to John. And finally, we recently promoted Andy Ivers to lead our Communication Systems segment. Many of you got a chance to meet him at the investor conference, and he has done a great job running several businesses within Communication Systems and has consistently delivered strong operational and financial performance while maintaining a focus on our customers. And he succeeds John Mega, who has been with L3 since the beginning and was instrumental in growing that segment into a multibillion-dollar business. After 44 years in the industry, John will be retiring, and we wish him well. 
Let me now talk about our cash deployment priorities. As I noted earlier, we are approaching R&D in a more strategic way by aligning it with our technology road map and investing in the most promising technology. We will continue to spend about 3% of our revenues on R&D.
Turning now to M&A. We are stepping up activity in attractive growth areas and strengthening areas of strategic significance for us. We invested over $300 million in 8 acquisitions in 2017. Right now, we have about 20 companies of varying sizes in our pipeline. I think it is reasonable to say we can spend $1 billion a year in M&A. Moving forward, we are deploying most of our cash to build the company through M&A, and we will buy back shares to offset share creep as a secondary use of our cash. 
In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and professionalism of our employees. We have a terrific team at headquarters and across all segments that is executing on our strategy. We're embarking on a number of changes to the growth -- to grow the company over the long term, and we'll continue to improve our margins and deliver organic growth, quality earnings and strong free cash flow. 
In addition, we're going to accomplish this by keeping our eye on the ball, being customer-centric and never being satisfied as we pursue excellence every day.
Ralph will now take you through the financial performance and outlook, and then we'll take some questions."

I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and reclassified to",1118,"Thanks, Chris. 
I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and reclassified to discontinued operations. 
Reviewing the fourth quarter, our results were generally in line with our outlook with strong orders, plus higher free cash flow and favorable tax items, mostly due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Admittedly, there are a few moving parts in our results, including the Vertex reclassification to discontinued operations, so we added a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from our midpoint guidance to our actual fourth quarter results in our website financial charts. 
So if you look at Page 5 of our web charts, you will see that our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.34, and it exceeded the midpoint guidance of -- by $1.12. The largest component of our higher EPS was a tax reform gain of $0.99. We also had a tax benefit of $0.38 from realigning our foreign legal entities. Partially offsetting these tax gains was charges of $0.24, mostly for new business integration and restructuring actions, which we took to further improve our core structure.
Fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $2.6 billion. Regarding the negative sales growth, you should recall that our accounting calendar added an extra week to our first quarter, which reversed in the fourth quarter. And everything else being equal, this lowered our growth rate by about 6 percentage points. Fourth quarter sales were in the high end of our outlook. Within the segments, DoD sales were solid, including the start of the new Compass Call recap program in Aerospace Systems and higher classified contract and airborne data link sales at Communication Systems. Soft market conditions continue to weigh on aviation security and Electronic Systems and commercial SATCOM and Communication Systems. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.2%, declining 50 basis points compared to 2016 fourth quarter because of an increase in restructuring charges. 
As we previously explained, we are decisively pursuing our integration strategy. Our fourth quarter results included business integration and restructuring charges of $39 million, which lowered margin by 150 basis points. Almost $30 million of those restructuring charges were not anticipated in our last guidance update. The components of the $30 million are a $12 million asset write-down on our property containing one of our IR detector foundries that we will consolidate; a $4 million pension curtailment charge; a $4 million of severance expansions to combine our 2 Canadian business in aerospace; and approximately $10 million for incremental costs on in-process restructuring activities, primarily the Traveling-Wave Tube business consolidation in Communication Systems.
The IR foundry consolidation is a new restructuring action in Sensor Systems, which we expect to generate annual cost savings of about $9 million beginning toward the end of 2019. 
Regarding the pension curtailment, at our investor conference, Chris and I commented that we were evaluating our pension plans. And since then, we've decided to freeze substantially all of our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2009 (sic) [ January 1, 2019 ] to no longer accrue annual service credit. We expect this action to reduce our pension expense by at least $25 million in 2019. 
Communication Systems margin was 7.8%. And excluding the $15 million of restructuring expenses there, it would have been 10.3%, slightly below our 2017 margin estimate. Communication Systems margin was also affected by the softness in the commercial satellite market, which caused lower overhead absorption and inventory provisioning in the space and power sector. 
Sensor Systems margin was 10.9%. And without the foundry consolidation charge, its margin would have been 13.6% for the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was robust at $347 million, and it benefited from higher receivable collections. Orders were also very healthy at $2.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the fourth quarter and 1.04 for the full year 2017. 
Moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased our EPS midpoint by $0.67 to $9.40. The EPS increase is due to lower estimated taxes with a tax rate now at 20% arising from the U.S. tax reform, which adds $0.80 to EPS, partially offset by $15 million of higher estimated pension expenses for 2018 based on the final December 31 pension assumptions, which subtracts $0.13 from EPS. Adjusting to exclude the 2017 tax reform gain, we expect 2018 EPS to grow about 11% over 2017. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains just under $10 billion with expected growth of 4% over 2017. We maintained all of our 2018 segment guidance ranges, and we now expect the growth over 2017 of 7% for Electronics, 2% for Communications, 12% for Sensors, and this growth is partially offset by a 4% decline at Aerospace.
Our updated operating margin guidance of 11.2% subtracts the higher pension expense, and we expect 2018 margin to increase 40 basis points versus 2017, with operating income growing 8%.
We also adjusted our 2018 margin guidance for 3 of our segments for the higher pension expense, and we now expect margins of 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11.1% for Communications, and we increased Sensor Systems margin by 30 basis points to 11.8% unrelated to the pension expense.
Regarding free cash flow, we increased our estimate by $35 million to $900 million due to lower taxes, partially offset by an expectation of fewer receivable collections. 
Regarding capital allocation, after paying dividends, as Chris explained, we continue to favor acquisitions. During 2017, we invested $317 million on acquisitions. We also repurchased $89 million of our stock during the fourth quarter and $180 million for the full year 2017. We ended with a cash balance of $662 million and expected to increase to $1.2 billion by the end of 2018 after paying more dividends and repurchasing $300 million of our stock in 2018 so that we will have plenty of firepower to make acquisitions.
Taking a quick look at the 2018 first quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion with operating margin in low 10% range and diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had a very solid 2017. Compared to 2016, we grew orders 5%, sales 4%, operating income 7%, EPS 20% and free cash flow 3%. We also increased margins 30 basis points to 10.7%. We remain focused on continuously improving our operational financial performance. In 2018, we will grow order sales and all the profit metrics, and we are also strategically executing our disciplined growth capital allocation plan and have ample liquidity to support those plans. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

So the team will all be compensated on earnings, cash and growth.

But if I look back on what's been accomplished the last 2 years, if you recall in 2016, we had 10.4% margins. We just wrapped up at 10.7%, and we're guiding to 11.2%. So I think in the last couple of years, I like the trajectory that we have. I've said, and we've jointly said, that we want to get to 12% by 2020. So I'm happy with the progress that we're making. I don't think there's a lot of guys that are growing year-over-year the way we are, and I think we're tracking. The decision on the pension, the defined benefit pension freeze, which, just to be clear, is effective January of '19, so in 11 months, that will kick in. That will be contributing favorably to our 2019 and beyond earnings. There's a lot of calculations and assumptions in that, but it's going to be at least $25 million based on what Ralph and I have seen for 2019. So that's going to obviously help us. And we're on a path to get to 12%. And as I continue to say and will continue to say, we're looking at long-term growth. We'll take restructuring charges. We'll take charges for layoffs. We'll take charges for selling facilities at a loss, and we will lower our earnings, as I told you in the October time frame, to increase R&D as we have in Sensor Systems for opportunity. So I like the trajectory we're on. I think we get everything we said we would, and we plan to continue with that. I don't know, Ralph, if there's anything further you want to add."

And then -- and maybe I'm not including the foundry and some of the other things you're talking about, but I just wanted to get a sense of the confidence in that. And then, Chris, for you a higher level question, going back to the 6th Prime discussion and so forth. When you break this up into the services and I think about some of the hires that you've made, you called out Sean Stackley, which we all know is an excellent hire. How do you think about L3 going forward from a service targeting perspective, especially with the loss of some of this Army work recently that we've all talked about. How -- is there a strategy here by service?"

And with respect to Communication Systems, your question was, how do we get to our guidance for 2018, which is around 11% from where we were in 2017? And there's basically 3 drivers of that. One, we expect that we're going to begin to realize cost savings or profit improvement from the Traveling-Wave to consolidation that we've been working on for the last 1.5 years. That's going to end in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect to generate about $7 million of savings from that consolidation in 2018. Additionally, I talked about the softness in the commercial satellite or commercial SATCOM market that we've been enduring in 2017, which caused low overhead absorption as well as some inventory reserving. So I don't expect that, that's going to recur in 2018. And then lastly..."

There's really 2 parts to it. The -- which I don't want to downplay. The first part is the nontraditional part, which I think aligns very well with the National Security strategy and some of the initiatives that secretary, board and other have on acquisition form. And it's really, I think, one of our key differentiators when we're talking about agility and innovation and speed to market. So that's the nontraditional piece. The 6th prime, of course, is having us prime, more work or move up the food chain or bundle our different systems into subsystems, subsystems into products and such. So that's kind of what I've laid out, and that's what the team has embraced. But relative to service by service, what I've said internally and publicly, aligns with the strategy that our nation has on this aggregation. And as much as I'd love to have a multibillion-dollar bomber or multibillion-dollar submarine or a multibillion-dollar ship, we're not going to have that. What we're going to do is support those, and our unmanned vehicles are a good example. So when we look at the Navy, you know we have 3 acquisitions last year to really get into a new market of unmanned undersea vehicles. And by all accounts, that's off to a great start. It's still in development. The mediums we're having in D.C. are very favorable. And I think there are hundreds, if not thousands, of UUV potential in the years and decades to come. So that's an example on the Navy strategy. With the Army, there's a whole push on soldier as a system. As you know, there's a whole Army modernization uptick, and I think we're going to have some progress there that we can talk about in the months ahead. And of course, with the Air Force, while we're platform-agnostic because we don't have a platform, I think when you look at some of the things we're doing in Aero, there's some great opportunities, whether it's C-130-amp. There's some classified things we're doing. There's some things we're doing for the new presidential aircraft. But at the end of the day, we have, I think, the best ISR capabilities out there, and that's an area where we're going to continue to grow. And we do have some unmanned air vehicles, probably like everybody else that they can't talk about. But that's the vision. And of course, sticking with the Air Force, the pilot training is an important part, and we made an acquisition a year ago. And I think we're the only company that actually does live training for the Air Force to get the pilots into the queue. So that's how we've laid it out. It's one of the things that Heidi Wood is spending a lot of time on as our Chief Strategy Officer, and we do have very unique and specific strategies that we're developing and implementing."

We're not happy, as I've said and Mike said even before I got here about where we are in Aero. It's a tough market. It's been shrinking, and it's a key year. The main focus is on Waco. We need to get more base in there, and we have a bid for the P-8 depot award. We expect 2 awards hopefully in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, and our goal is to get one of those 2 awards. And as you would imagine, this would replace the P-3 work that finished a couple of years ago. So strategically, I'd keep an eye on P-8. It's a slow ramp, but it will give us the base that is so important in these capital-intense facilities. The one I'm excited about is later in this year, is C-130-amp, and this is the avionics upgrade program for the C-130s. There's 3 or 4 competitors. You probably guessed who they are. And we've invested in some new avionic packages that are flying quite well on the C-130s, and it's a big cockpit upgrade. It's in our sweet spot, and the proposal is in. We'll know more in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure we'll go through the normal fee and process. And then we have a classified program that's pretty exciting. So I feel like we have opportunities in Waco. We have a couple of big proposals then, and that's something you guys and I and Mark Von Schwarz and others will be watching closely. Greenville is kind of the bread-and-butter of Aero, and they have a great tradition in ISR capability. And we had a big international award last year with the business jets. And there's 3 countries in the near term that we have discussions with, and those could be 2019 orders. And I think in the next 12 months, in addition to Mark and a few of us, I'll personally be visiting those 3 countries to let them know of our corporate commitment and the importance of that. And it's really about, I think, in the near term fleet expansion. These ISR capabilities are so, so good. There's high demand to give them the threats in the world, and there really is a fair amount of short supply. So it's going to be a key year and a transitional year. We did mention that we're doing work on the new presidential aircraft for the mission communications systems. So there's a whole lot out there. And then I'll just say on M&A. I mentioned we did 8. We got a pipeline here. Everybody's focused on it. Every one of our core groups, core segments, has something. And just like the last 2 years, they vary from niche bolt-on all the way up to what I'd like to say are more interesting acquisitions. But they're all under $0.5 billion, and there's a couple of international and mainly defense-related things. We get a lot of pilot training and security detection the last couple of years. So that's where we are. 
I guess if you want to email questions in, we seem to have some sort of technical difficulty, just email them to Heidi Wood. And someone is actually handing me a new iPhone 10 here that says, oh, from Carter Copeland. I guess I got to read this out loud to myself and answer. 
Chris, here's a 2-part question. $30 million of incremental restructuring, this all just in the month of December. Has been wondering specifically about the pace with which you and the rest of the team are identifying opportunities, whether they be on cost, talent, process improvement, M&A, you name it. Can you provide some insight on that perspective? And then secondly, the comment you made about widening the aperture of technology, can you elaborate on what that means for both of your existing business as well as things you may want to acquire? This was kind of cool, like I read myself a question from -- I'm going to have to get myself an iPhone 10. It's actually a nice large screen. 
So the first question, I guess, is the pace. Well, if anything isn't obvious, I like to go fast. My team likes to go fast. And I can assure you, we are going very fast. Three of the 4 group presidents have been in the job less than a year. We were all together just 2 days this week going through our plans and strategies. And it's -- just quicker is kind of our theme here. So we're taking out cost on the structuring. We'll continue to do that. We have some big wins that we need to get. But if they don't play out, we will have layoffs. We will restructure. We will move facilities. Clearly, we're working with local state to get incentives where appropriate to help offset some of the cost, selling the building for the gain out in California. We have another property we're looking at that's got a lot of interest, so we might do something creative there on a sale-leaseback. Everything's on the table. On the M&A side, we're not adverse to joint ventures. Again, the National Security strategy talks a lot about partnerships around the globe, and I think we are in an incredibly unique position. We have great relationships in Europe and around the world, who are a trusted partner, and I think that's going to give us a strategic advantage, so we seem to be well aligned. So on the M&A front, we did 8 last year. I have no issue doing 8 this year if they made sense, and we're looking at them. We have a couple we'd --  may be able to close them in the next 60 days, and we'll keep you abreast on that. But we're all moving very, very quickly. 
And then the second question. He just deleted that. Someone -- can you go back to the second question? It was about widening the aperture on the technology. Well, that comes in a couple of forms. We -- there are some things we're looking at where we have to do a better job, maybe tying in with commercial companies and taking their technologies to market. Some of these markets we're looking at and our customers want are literally hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of investment. So we're looking at how we can partner with some companies out in the West and bring them in to the Department of Defense. And we're also looking at different customers. It's the same old -- some of these ISR capabilities are world-class, and we tend to focus on 1 or 2 customers. But there's other services in the U.S., and there's international countries, so we're going to be much more aggressive on that front. So historically, our group president, maybe myself, have been focused on the internal operations and the financials, which will continue, but we're going to be traveling the globe. We're going to meet with customers. We're going to be meeting with members of Congress, and we're going to aggressively grow this company. Ralph?"

So we also received a follow-up question from Cai at Cowen regarding the underlying assumptions for our pension expense for 2018. So I'll quickly review those. So we basically had a few items that resulted in us increasing our estimated pension expense by $15 million for 2018. And even after that increase, we still anticipate that our year-over-year net pension expense, FAS expense less to CAS recoveries is going to decline by about $13 million. So with respect to discount rate, our discount rate has declined by about 60 basis points from the end of 2016 through the end of 2017, so the assumption that we're using is 3.78%. And what happened there is, not only did we see a reduction in the treasury yields, but there's also been a tightening of credit spreads, especially across the investment grade bonds, and that's what's driving the reduction in discount rate. Fortunately, we have very good asset return in 2017, where the pension trust returned 15.5%, which is much better than our assumption, which is just under 8%. And we'll be assuming the same asset return-type assumption for 2018. So..."

I mean, I think the industry, including myself, had been in D.C. Me, as recently, as last week. And the recurring question is what is the impact of the CR, and I've taken the approach, which I believe in is the biggest concern is the impact on our customers. And we all know the impact of the CR, the inability to have new start, the inability to ramp up. And clearly, there's a strategy that's requiring certain systems. And when you can't provide them to the warfighter, I think they're the ones most harmed. And something that doesn't get a lot of attention in my opinion are the second, third and fourth year subs. There's a lot of small companies that we all work with, especially L3, and we find our self maybe propping these guys up financially with cash. So the bread and butter of our country are these small innovative businesses. And I've told you I think we're the federation of entrepreneurs, but much larger than some of these companies, and I don't think people understand and appreciate the impact they're having. So we're focusing on the supply chain and customer. And then ultimately, everything I'm reading is there should be a budget in mid-February, maybe it slips a week or 2. And once that happens, it will be a matter of how quickly everyone can get the new contracts onto -- or the new orders on the contract. So 7 straight years, I think the industry has probably figured it out. It's the obvious stuff. We're not hiring people if we don't have business. We're trying to keep the R&D spend up. But it just puts a drag on the business. And we all know the situation around the world. The new strategy focuses more on near peers than the terrorist threat, and that has different ramifications. There's a lot of discussion about having a more agile military, and I like that because I believe we're an agile company. There's a lot of discussions about [ neutrality ] and partnerships. So that's the start with the strategy, and then it has to flow, just like a company, into the budget. And we'll be prepared to be with our customer and try to get the stuff under contract as quickly as possible. So hopefully, that answers your question, Jon. And I think we'll take our last question next."

But no, I think all the trends are good. There's been discussions about accelerating the licensing and the export approval process. And I think this is an area where we set up the board. I'm looking at adding more talents in these international area. Because when you look at our portfolio and you look at the affordability and the agility of our systems, notwithstanding ISR is a larger one, there's a lot of need, and a lot of these countries have tight budgets. I was recently in Singapore and Japan and Taiwan. We've got some Mid East trips coming up in a few months. And we can get under contract quickly, and we have capabilities that they need. So things always take longer abroad, but I like the fact that the administration is aligning with the industry and trying to get these things that are appropriate into our partners and allies' hands. So that will be a focus of ours for 2018 as it was in 2017. And I'm just talking the military stuff. The commercial side, clearly, the pilot shortage is a global issue. We have trained centers in Taiwan and U.K. and are looking to expand elsewhere. So I feel real good about what we can do on the pilot training side internationally. In security and detection, as I told some people, Europe is ahead of the U.S., which I think is unfortunate as an American to be lagging the rest of the world. So we're actually doing quite well in security and detection in Europe, and hopefully, our country catches up and get some new systems in.

We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0. As you may have seen, we hit the ground running in early January with new organizational announcements. We're adding well-respected outside leaders to help us intensify our drive for growth and bring a fresh perspective. 
We'll be rolling out a number of new initiatives to further my 3 key themes for 2018: integration, collaboration and innovation. If we go back to our investor conference in December, we spoke about our focus in 2018 on better integrating the enterprise. This is a company with a lot of potential and a lot of work to be done. We are actively at work improving our processes; streamlining our procedures; deepening our L365 initiatives, which is our continuous improvement focus; and in some areas, moving and changing our people for improved growth and accountability.
We're positioning the company for higher margins this year, and at the same time, we're investing in new processes as well as getting more strategic on our technology road map. It's important to push open the aperture for more top line growth in the years ahead. 
I believe, and our segment presidents believe, we can be doing better across the board, and we're raising expectations to achieve that. I'm a big believer in continuous improvement, and we have embarked on a number of internal initiatives. 
Before we discuss our results, I want to touch quickly on the Defense budget. The recent vote to end the shutdown and fund the government for 3 weeks shows some progress, but it is still temporary. Like the rest of the industry, we are concerned about how the continuing resolution impacts the U.S. military's ability to plan and execute its mission. We will leverage our strengths of agility and adaptability to support our customers as they navigate in this uncertain budget environment. We are watching the matter closely, and our guidance assumes that we don't have a protracted CR.
In terms of our financials, we had a good quarter and ended the year with increased sales, improved margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Our 2017 EPS and margins could have been higher, but we continue to make decisions to increase our efficiency and profitability by integrating and restructuring our businesses. As I've said before, we'll take a short-term onetime charge in exchange for recurring long-term profitable earnings growth. Ralph will explain some of the fourth quarter decisions in a few minutes. 
We entered the year with a goal of growing sales for the first time since the turn of the decade, and we accomplished that goal. I would also add that with the new tax law, we had a onetime gain of almost $80 million, and we will have a lower tax provision in the future. We're one of the few companies that recorded a gain from the tax reform due to our various tax planning strategies. 
We also increased our strong cash position, giving us the ability to grow our business through acquisitions and various organic growth initiatives. This is and will always be a priority for L3. 
Free cash flow and cash conversion are important metrics to me and the leadership team. It's a big part of how we evaluate our performance, and we'll be discussing it regularly in our conversations with you. At the same time, we are investing to drive more top line and earnings growth in the years ahead. We know where we're headed, and we're determined to become a nontraditional 6th Prime. We have the resources to execute this vision, and we will invest in new technologies that are vital to the warfighter and our commercial aviation customers. 
As we began 2018, our leadership team is energized, and we're starting from a unique position. We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lean corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strengths. And we're pushing agility, technology and rapid adaptability deeper into our markets. We believe, and the world around us shows, that the future belongs not to the biggest but to the fastest. 
Operationally, we are integrating our businesses and internal systems to increase productivity and accelerate information flow. This will lead to more timely decisions and increased profitability. We are intensifying the focus on collaboration by bundling capabilities into total solutions as well as collaborating on technology developments and strategic pursuits. In addition, we are investing in areas that are aligned with the new national defense strategy. 
Across L3, we are developing advanced technologies in important growth markets to enhance our leadership position, including ISR, protected communications, sensors, night vision and airport security. We also have affordable and innovative solutions in both commercial and military pilot training. 
As we execute on our vision for L3, it is clear that some capabilities are no longer a good fit and would be better in another company. We've begun the sale process for Vertex, and we've seen a significant amount of interest in the business. We expect to receive initial indications of interest before the end of February and remain on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of this year. Divesting it will enable the Aerospace Systems leadership team to redirect their focus into areas where it is best suited to grow. We continually evaluate the portfolio based on market trends and outlook. 
Structurally, our business leaders have been working hard at sectorizing our divisions. By integrating and optimizing our sectors, we are creating businesses that have critical mass and are aligned with customer priorities. 
We are also taking steps to improve how we market ourselves internationally. At the beginning of this year, we established 3 new boards in Australia, Canada and the U.K. These boards will help our focus on growing more international business, strengthen customer relationships and support the thousands of employees who are working every day to meet the needs of our customers in these regions. Looking ahead, we have prioritized a dozen or so countries, primarily in the Middle East and Asia, and we're tailoring strategies for doing more business in each. 
Let's now turn to talent as I'm putting the right people in the right places. We've made some great additions to the management team. Sean Stackley has joined us as our Vice President of Strategic Advanced Programs and Technologies. Sean was a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was one of the most respected leaders in the Pentagon. We also brought on Pat O'Reilly as our Vice President of Corporate Engineering. Pat was the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and will help us expand our system engineering capabilities. John Feren recently joined us as the new Vice President of Business Development and Marketing. John is a well-recognized expert in commercial aviation and will help us better connect with customers in that market. Just last night, John was recognized as the face of aviation at the Dublin Airline Conference. So congratulations to John. And finally, we recently promoted Andy Ivers to lead our Communication Systems segment. Many of you got a chance to meet him at the investor conference, and he has done a great job running several businesses within Communication Systems and has consistently delivered strong operational and financial performance while maintaining the focus on our customers. Andy succeeds John Mega, who has been with L3 since the beginning and was instrumental in growing that segment into a multibillion-dollar business. After 44 years in the industry, John will be retiring, and we wish him well. 
Let me now talk about our cash deployment priorities. As I noted earlier, we are approaching R&D in a more strategic way by aligning it with our technology road map and investing in the most promising technologies. We will continue to spend about 3% of our revenues on R&D.
Turning now to M&A. We are stepping up activity in attractive growth areas and strengthening areas of strategic significance for us. We invested over $300 million in 8 acquisitions in 2017. Right now, we have about 20 companies of varying sizes in our pipeline. I think it is reasonable to say we can spend $1 billion a year in M&A. Moving forward, we are deploying most of our cash to build the company through M&A, and we will buy back shares to offset share creep as a secondary use of our cash. 
In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and professionalism of our employees. We have a terrific team at headquarters and across all segments that is executing on our strategy. We're embarking on a number of changes to the growth -- to grow the company over the long term, and we'll continue to improve our margins and deliver organic growth, quality earnings and strong free cash flow. 
In addition, we're going to accomplish this by keeping our eye on the ball, being customer-centric and never being satisfied as we pursue excellence every day.
Ralph will now take you through the financial performance and outlook, and then we'll take some questions."

I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and have reclassified to discontinued operations. 
Reviewing the fourth quarter, our results were generally in line with our outlook, with strong orders plus higher free cash flow and favorable tax items, mostly due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Admittedly, there are a few moving parts in our results, including the Vertex reclassification to discontinued operations, so we added a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from our midpoint guidance to our actual fourth quarter results in our website financial charts. 
So if you look at Page 5 of our web charts, you will see that our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.34, and it exceeded the midpoint guidance of -- by $1.12. The largest component of our higher EPS was a tax reform gain of $0.99. We also had a tax benefit of $0.38 from realigning our foreign legal entities. Partially offsetting these tax gains was charges of $0.24, mostly for new business integration and restructuring actions, which we took to further improve our core structure.
Fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $2.6 billion. Regarding the negative sales growth, you should recall that our accounting calendar added an extra week to our first quarter, which reversed in the fourth quarter, and everything else being equal, this lowered our growth rate by about 6 percentage points. Fourth quarter sales were on the high end of our outlook. Within the segments, DoD sales were solid, including the start of a new Compass Call recap program at Aerospace Systems and higher classified contract and airborne data link sales at Communication Systems. Soft market conditions continue to weigh on aviation security in Electronic Systems and commercial SATCOM in Communication Systems. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.2%, declining 50 basis points compared to the 2016 fourth quarter because of an increase in restructuring charges. 
As we previously explained, we are decisively pursuing our integration strategy. Our fourth quarter results included business integration and restructuring charges of $39 million, which lowered margin by 150 basis points. Almost $30 million of those restructuring charges were not anticipated in our last guidance update. The components of the $30 million are a $12 million asset write-down on our property containing one of our IR detector foundries that we will consolidate; a $4 million pension curtailment charge; $4 million of severance expansions to combine our 2 Canadian businesses in Aerospace; and approximately $10 million for incremental costs on in-process restructuring activities, primarily the Traveling-Wave Tube business consolidation in Communication Systems.
The IR foundry consolidation is a new restructuring action in Sensor Systems, which we expect to generate annual cost savings of about $9 million beginning toward the end of 2019. 
Regarding the pension curtailment, at our investor conference, Chris and I commented that we were evaluating our pension plans. And since then, we've decided to freeze substantially all of our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2009 (sic) [ January 1, 2019 ] to no longer accrue annual service credit. We expect this action to reduce our pension expense by at least $25 million in 2019. 
Communication Systems' margin was 7.8%. And excluding the $15 million of restructuring expenses there, it would have been 10.3%, slightly below our 2017 margin estimate. Communication Systems margin was also affected by the softness in the commercial satellite market, which caused lower overhead absorption and inventory provisioning in the space and power sector. 
Sensor Systems' margin was 10.9%. And without the foundry consolidation charge, its margin would have been 13.6% for the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was robust at $347 million, and it benefited from higher receivable collections. Orders were also very healthy at $2.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the fourth quarter and 1.04 for the full year 2017. 
Moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased our EPS midpoint by $0.67 to $9.40. The EPS increase is due to lower estimated taxes, with a tax rate now at 20% arising from the U.S. tax reform, which adds $0.80 to EPS, partially offset by $15 million of higher estimated pension expenses for 2018 based on the final December 31 pension assumptions, which subtracts $0.13 from EPS. Adjusting to exclude the 2017 tax reform gain, we expect 2018 EPS to grow about 11% over 2017. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains just under $10 billion, with expected growth of 4% over 2017. We maintained all of our 2018 segment guidance ranges, and we now expect growth over 2017 of 7% for Electronics, 2% for Communications, 12% for Sensors, and this growth is partially offset by a 4% decline at Aerospace.
Our updated operating margin guidance of 11.2% subtracts the higher pension expense, and we expect 2018 margin to increase 40 basis points versus 2017, with operating income growing 8%.
We also adjusted our 2018 margin guidance for 3 of our segments for the higher pension expense, and we now expect margins of 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11.1% for Communications, and we increased Sensor Systems margin by 30 basis points to 11.8%, unrelated to the pension expense.
Regarding free cash flow, we increased our estimate by $35 million to $900 million due to lower taxes, partially offset by an expectation of fewer receivable collections. 
Regarding capital allocation, after paying dividends, as Chris explained, we continue to favor acquisitions. During 2017, we invested $317 million on acquisitions. We also repurchased $89 million of our stock during the fourth quarter and $180 million for the full year 2017. We ended with a cash balance of $662 million and expect it to increase to $1.2 billion by the end of 2018 after paying our dividends and repurchasing $300 million of our stock in 2018 so that we will have plenty of firepower to make acquisitions.
Taking a quick look at the 2018 first quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion with operating margin in the low 10% range and diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had a very solid 2017. Compared to 2016, we grew orders 5%, sales 4%, operating income 7%, EPS 20% and free cash flow 3%. We also increased margins 30 basis points to 10.7%. We remain focused on continuously improving our operational and financial performance. In 2018, we will grow order sales and all the profit metrics, and we are also strategically executing our disciplined growth capital allocation plan and have ample liquidity to support those plans. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

And there's no significant changes there, because there's only, as you know, one share of L3 stock, and we all share in its ultimate growth. But on the annual bonus program, we're making changes in 2018 on a couple of fronts. First of all, instead of being solely focused on the earnings and cash metric, we're adding a third metric, which I'll be proposing to our Compensation Committee and Board in a few weeks, and that is one of organic growth. So the team will all be compensated on earnings, cash and growth. And then secondarily, we're going to have a mixed bonus where you will be compensated not only for how your entity does but the entity above you, which will drive collaboration. And then I reserved the right to make discretionary adjustments for cross-segment collaboration. So I think excellent question. And you get what you measure, and you pay what you measure. So we made those adjustments. I'll be proposing them. I have no doubt the board we'll embrace them, and I think that's going to help assure our success."

And within security and detection systems or aviation security, we definitely had lower order flow in 2017, and we see the orders improving this year, in 2018. So that's going to be a contributor to sales growth and operating income. And we see continued growth in the training and simulation businesses both on the military side and the commercial side.

I don't think there's a lot of guys that are growing year-over-year the way we are, and I think we're tracking. The decision on the pension, the defined benefit pension freeze, which, just to be clear, is effective January of '19, so in 11 months, that will kick in, that will be contributing favorably to our 2019 and beyond earnings. There's a lot of calculations and assumptions in that, but it's going to be at least $25 million based on what Ralph and I have seen for 2019. So that's going to obviously help us. And we're on a path to get to 12%. And as I continue to say and will continue to say, we're looking at long-term growth. We'll take restructuring charges. We'll take charges for layoffs. We'll take charges for selling facilities at a loss, and we will lower our earnings, as I told you in the October time frame, to increase R&D, as we have in Sensor Systems, for opportunity. So I like the trajectory we're on. I think we've hit everything we said we would, and we plan to continue with that. I don't know, Ralph, if there's anything further you want to add?"

And with respect to Communication Systems, your question was how do we get to our guidance for 2018, which is around 11%, from where we were in 2017? And there's basically 3 drivers of that. One, we expect that we're going to begin to realize cost savings or profit improvement from the Traveling-Wave Tube consolidation that we've been working on for the last 1.5 years. That's going to end in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect to generate about $7 million of savings from that consolidation in 2018. Additionally, I talked about the softness in the commercial satellite or commercial SATCOM market that we've been enduring in 2017, which caused low overhead absorption as well as some inventory reserving. So I don't expect that, that's going to recur in 2018. And then lastly..."

There's really 2 parts to it. The -- which I don't want to downplay. The first part is the nontraditional part, which I think aligns very well with the national security strategy and some of the initiatives that the secretary, board, and others have on the acquisition form. And it's really, I think, one of our key differentiators when we're talking about agility and innovation and speed to market. So that's the nontraditional piece. The 6th Prime, of course, is having us prime more work, or move up the food chain, or bundle our different systems into subsystems, subsystems into products and such. So that's kind of what I've laid out, and that's what the team has embraced. But relative to service by service, what I've said internally and publicly aligns with the strategy that our nation has on disaggregation. And as much as I'd love to have a multibillion-dollar bomber or a multibillion-dollar submarine or a multibillion-dollar ship, we're not going to have that. What we're going to do is support those, and our unmanned vehicles are a good example. So when we look at the Navy, we had 3 acquisitions last year to really get into a new market of unmanned undersea vehicles. And by all accounts, that's off to a great start. It's still in development. The meetings we're having in D.C. are very favorable. And I think there are hundreds, if not thousands, of UUV potential in the years and decades to come. So that's an example on the Navy strategy. With the Army, there's a whole push on soldier as a system. As you know, there's a whole Army modernization uptick, and I think we're going to have some progress there that we can talk about in the months ahead. And of course, with the Air Force, while we're platform-agnostic because we don't have a platform, I think when you look at some of the things we're doing in Aero, there's some great opportunities, whether it's a C-130-amp, there's some classified things we're doing, there's some things we're doing for the new presidential aircraft. But at the end of the day, we have, I think, the best ISR capabilities out there, and that's an area where we're going to continue to grow. And we do have some unmanned air vehicles, probably like everybody else, that they can't talk about. But that's the vision. And of course, sticking with the Air Force, the pilot training is an important part, and we made an acquisition a year ago, and I think we're the only company that actually does live training for the Air Force to get their pilots into the queue. So that's how we've laid it out. It's one of the things that Heidi Wood is spending a lot of time on as our Chief Strategy Officer, and we do have very unique and specific strategies that we're developing and implementing."

We're not happy, as I've said and Mike said even before I got here about where we are in Aero. It's a tough market. It's been shrinking, and it's a key year. The main focus is on Waco. We need to get more base in there, and we have a bid for the P-8 depot award. We expect 2 awards hopefully in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, and our goal is to get one of those 2 awards. And as you would imagine, this would replace the P-3 work that finished a couple of years ago. So strategically, I'd keep an eye on P-8. It's a slow ramp, but it will give us the base that is so important in these capital-intense facilities. The one I'm excited about is later in this year, is C-130-amp, and this is the avionics upgrade program for the C-130s. There's 3 or 4 competitors. You can probably guess who they are. And we've invested in some new avionic packages that are flying quite well on the C-130s, and it's a big cockpit upgrade. It's in our sweet spot, and the proposal is in. We'll know more in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure we'll go through the normal [ key-in ] process. And then we have a classified program that's pretty exciting. So I feel like we have opportunities in Waco. We have a couple of big proposals in, and that's something you guys and I and Mark Von Schwarz and others will be watching closely. Greenville is kind of the bread-and-butter of Aero, and they have a great tradition in ISR capability. And we had a big international award last year with some business jets. And there's 3 countries in the near term that we have discussions with, and those could be 2019 orders. And I think in the next 12 months, in addition to Mark and a few of us, I'll personally be visiting those 3 countries to let them know of our corporate commitment and the importance of that. And it's really about, I think, in the near term, fleet expansion. These ISR capabilities are so good, there's high demand given the threats in the world, and there really is a fair amount of short supply. So it's going to be a key year and a transitional year. We did mention that we're doing work on the new presidential aircraft for the mission communications system. So there's a whole lot out there. And then I'll just say on M&A, I mentioned we did 8. We've got a pipeline here. Everybody's focused on it. Every one of our core groups, core segments, has something. And just like the last 2 years, they vary from niche bolt-ons all the way up to what I like to say are more interesting acquisitions. But they're all under $0.5 billion, and there's a couple of international and mainly defense-related things. We did a lot of pilot training and security detection the last couple of years. So that's where we are. 
I guess if you want to email questions in, we seem to have some sort of technical difficulty, just email them to Heidi Wood. And someone is actually handing me a new iPhone 10 here that says, oh, from Carter Copeland. I guess I've got to read this out loud to myself and answer. 
Chris, here's a 2-part question. $30 million of incremental restructuring, this all just in the month of December, has been wondering specifically about the pace with which you and the rest of the team are identifying opportunities, whether they be on cost, talent, process improvement, M&A, you name it. Can you provide some insight on that perspective? And then secondly, the comment you made about widening the aperture of technology, can you elaborate on what that means for both your existing business as well as things you may want to acquire? Those are kind of cool, like I read myself a question from it. I'm going to have to get myself an iPhone 10. It's actually a nice large screen. 
So the first question, I guess, is the pace. Well, if anything isn't obvious, I like to go fast. My team likes to go fast. And I can assure you, we are going very fast. Three of the 4 group presidents have been in their job less than a year. We were all together just 2 days this week going through our plans and strategies. And it's -- just quicker is kind of our theme here. So we're taking out costs on the structuring. We'll continue to do that. We have some big wins that we need to get. But if they don't play out, we will have layoffs. We will restructure. We will move facilities. Clearly, we're working with the local states to get incentives where appropriate to help offset some of the costs. Selling the building for the gain out in California. We have another property we're looking at that's got a lot of interest, so we might do something creative there on a sale-leaseback. Everything's on the table. On the M&A side, we're not adverse to joint ventures. Again, the national security strategy talks a lot about partnerships around the globe, and I think we are in an incredibly unique position. We have great relationships in Europe and around the world. We're a trusted partner. And I think that's going to give us a strategic advantage as we seem to be well aligned. So on the M&A front, we did 8 last year. I have no issue doing 8 this year if they make sense, and we're looking at them. We have a couple that may be able to close in the next 60 days, and we'll keep you abreast on that. But we're all moving very, very quickly. 
And then the second question. He just deleted that. Someone -- can we go back to the second question? It was about widening the aperture on the technology. Well, that comes in a couple of forms. We -- there are some things we're looking at where we have to do a better job maybe tying in with commercial companies and taking their technologies to market. Some of these markets we're looking at and our customers want are literally hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of investment. So we're looking at how we can partner with some companies out in the West and bring them in to the Department of Defense. And we're also looking at different customers. It's the same old -- some of these ISR capabilities are world-class, and we tend to focus on 1 or 2 customers. But there's other services in the U.S., and there's international countries, so we're going to be much more aggressive on that front. So historically, our group president, maybe myself, have been focused on the internal operations and the financials, which will continue, but we're going to be traveling the globe. We're going to meet with customers. We're going to be meeting with members of Congress, and we're going to aggressively grow this company. Ralph?"

So we also received a follow-up question from Cai at Cowen regarding the underlying assumptions for our pension expense for 2018. So I'll quickly review those. So we basically had a few items that resulted in us increasing our estimated pension expense by $15 million for 2018. And even after that increase, we still anticipate that our year-over-year net pension expense, the FAS expense less the CAS recoveries, is going to decline by about $13 million. So with respect to discount rate, our discount rate has declined by about 60 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, so the assumption that we're using is 3.78%. And what happened there is not only did we see a reduction in the treasury yields, but there's also been a tightening of credit spreads, especially across the investment grade bonds, and that's what's driving the reduction in the discount rate. Fortunately, we had very good asset return in 2017, where the pension trust returned 15.5%, which is much better than our assumption, which is just under 8%. And we'll be assuming the same asset return-type assumption for 2018. So..."

I mean, I think industry, including myself, have been in D.C. Me, as recently, as last week. And the recurring question is what is the impact of the CR, and I've taken the approach, which I believe in, is the biggest concern is the impact on our customers. And we all know the impact of a CR, the inability to have new starts, the inability to ramp up. And clearly, there's a strategy that's requiring certain systems. And when you can't provide them to the warfighter, I think they're the ones most harmed. And something that doesn't get a lot of attention in my opinion are the second, third and fourth-year subs. There's a lot of small companies that we all work with, especially L3, and we find ourself maybe propping these guys up financially with cash. So the bread and butter of our country are these small innovative businesses. And I've told you I think we're a federation of entrepreneurs, but much larger than some of these companies, and I don't think people understand and appreciate the impact they're having. So we're focusing on the supply chain and our customer. And then ultimately, everything I'm reading is there should be a budget in mid-February, maybe it slips a week or 2. And once that happens, it will be a matter of how quickly everyone can get the new contracts onto -- or the new orders on to contract. So 7 straight years, I think the industry has probably figured it out. It's the obvious stuff. We're not hiring people if we don't have business. We're trying to keep the R&D spend up. But it just puts a drag on the business. And we all know the situation around the world. The new strategy focuses more on our near peers than the terrorist threat, and that has different ramifications. There's a lot of discussion about having a more agile military, and I like that because I believe we're an agile company. There's a lot of discussions about [indiscernible] and partnerships. So that's the start with the strategy, and then it has to flow, just like a company, into the budget. And we'll be prepared to meet with our customer and try to get the stuff under contract as quickly as possible. So hopefully, that answers your question, Jon. And I think we'll take our last question next."

We do have a lot of business supporting primes and other partners on systems that may or may not be deployed internationally, so we don't throw that number in. But no, I think all the trends are good. There's been discussions about accelerating the licensing and the export approval process. And I think this is an area where we set up the boards. I'm looking at adding more talents in the international area. Because when you look at our portfolio and you look at the affordability and the agility of our systems, notwithstanding ISR as a larger one, there's a lot of need. And a lot of these countries have tight budgets. I was recently in Singapore and Japan and Taiwan. I've got some Mid East trips coming up in a few months. And we can get under contract quickly, and we have capabilities that they need. So things always take longer abroad, but I like the fact that the administration is aligning with industry in trying to get these things that are appropriate into our partners' and allies' hands. So that will be a focus of ours for 2018, as it was in 2017. And I'm just talking the military stuff. The commercial side, clearly, the pilot shortage is a global issue. We have training centers in Taiwan and the U.K. and are looking to expand elsewhere. So I feel real good about what we can do on the pilot training side internationally. In security and detection, as I've told some people, Europe is ahead of the U.S., which I think is unfortunate, as an American, to be lagging the rest of the world. So we're actually doing quite well in security and detection in Europe, and hopefully, our country catches up and gets some new systems in.

We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0. As you may have seen, we hit the ground running in early January with new organizational announcements. We're adding well-respected outside leaders to help us intensify our drive for growth and bring a fresh perspective. 
We'll be rolling out a number of new initiatives to further my 3 key themes for 2018: integration, collaboration and innovation. If we go back to our investor conference in December, we spoke about our focus in 2018 on better integrating the enterprise. This is a company with a lot of potential and a lot of work to be done. We are actively at work improving our processes; streamlining our procedures; deepening our L365 initiatives, which is our continuous improvement focus; and in some areas, moving and changing our people for improved growth and accountability.
We're positioning the company for higher margins this year, and at the same time, we're investing in new processes as well as getting more strategic on our technology road map. It's important to push open the aperture for more top line growth in the years ahead. 
I believe, and our segment presidents believe, we can be doing better across the board, and we're raising expectations to achieve that. I'm a big believer in continuous improvement, and we have embarked on a number of internal initiatives. 
Before we discuss our results, I want to touch quickly on the Defense budget. The recent vote to end the shutdown and fund the government for 3 weeks shows some progress, but it is still temporary. Like the rest of the industry, we are concerned about how the continuing resolution impacts the U.S. military's ability to plan and execute its mission. We will leverage our strengths of agility and adaptability to support our customers as they navigate in this uncertain budget environment. We are watching the matter closely, and our guidance assumes that we don't have a protracted CR.
In terms of our financials, we had a good quarter and ended the year with increased sales, improved margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Our 2017 EPS and margins could have been higher, but we continue to make decisions to increase our efficiency and profitability by integrating and restructuring our businesses. As I've said before, we'll take a short-term onetime charge in exchange for recurring long-term profitable earnings growth. Ralph will explain some of the fourth quarter decisions in a few minutes. 
We entered the year with a goal of growing sales for the first time since the turn of the decade, and we accomplished that goal. I would also add that with the new tax law, we had a onetime gain of almost $80 million, and we will have a lower tax provision in the future. We're one of the few companies that recorded a gain from the tax reform due to our various tax planning strategies. 
We also increased our strong cash position, giving us the ability to grow our business through acquisitions and various organic growth initiatives. This is and will always be a priority for L3. 
Free cash flow and cash conversion are important metrics to me and the leadership team. It's a big part of how we evaluate our performance, and we'll be discussing it regularly in our conversations with you. At the same time, we are investing to drive more top line and earnings growth in the years ahead. We know where we're headed, and we're determined to become a nontraditional 6th Prime. We have the resources to execute this vision, and we will invest in new technologies that are vital to the warfighter and our commercial aviation customers. 
As we began 2018, our leadership team is energized, and we're starting from a unique position. We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lean corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strengths. And we're pushing agility, technology and rapid adaptability deeper into our markets. We believe, and the world around us shows, that the future belongs not to the biggest but to the fastest. 
Operationally, we are integrating our businesses and internal systems to increase productivity and accelerate information flow. This will lead to more timely decisions and increased profitability. We are intensifying the focus on collaboration by bundling capabilities into total solutions as well as collaborating on technology developments and strategic pursuits. In addition, we are investing in areas that are aligned with the new national defense strategy. 
Across L3, we are developing advanced technologies in important growth markets to enhance our leadership position, including ISR, protected communications, sensors, night vision and airport security. We also have affordable and innovative solutions in both commercial and military pilot training. 
As we execute on our vision for L3, it is clear that some capabilities are no longer a good fit and would be better in another company. We've begun the sale process for Vertex, and we've seen a significant amount of interest in the business. We expect to receive initial indications of interest before the end of February and remain on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of this year. Divesting it will enable the Aerospace Systems leadership team to redirect their focus into areas where it is best suited to grow. We continually evaluate the portfolio based on market trends and outlook. 
Structurally, our business leaders have been working hard at sectorizing our divisions. By integrating and optimizing our sectors, we are creating businesses that have critical mass and are aligned with customer priorities. 
We are also taking steps to improve how we market ourselves internationally. At the beginning of this year, we established 3 new boards in Australia, Canada and the U.K. These boards will help our focus on growing more international business, strengthen customer relationships and support the thousands of employees who are working every day to meet the needs of our customers in these regions. Looking ahead, we have prioritized a dozen or so countries, primarily in the Middle East and Asia, and we're tailoring strategies for doing more business in each. 
Let's now turn to talent as I'm putting the right people in the right places. We've made some great additions to the management team. Sean Stackley has joined us as our Vice President of Strategic Advanced Programs and Technologies. Sean was a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was one of the most respected leaders in the Pentagon. We also brought on Pat O'Reilly as our Vice President of Corporate Engineering. Pat was the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and will help us expand our system engineering capabilities. John Feren recently joined us as the new Vice President of Business Development and Marketing. John is a well-recognized expert in commercial aviation and will help us better connect with customers in that market. Just last night, John was recognized as the face of aviation at the Dublin Airline Conference. So congratulations to John. And finally, we recently promoted Andy Ivers to lead our Communication Systems segment. Many of you got a chance to meet him at the investor conference, and he has done a great job running several businesses within Communication Systems and has consistently delivered strong operational and financial performance while maintaining the focus on our customers. Andy succeeds John Mega, who has been with L3 since the beginning and was instrumental in growing that segment into a multibillion-dollar business. After 44 years in the industry, John will be retiring, and we wish him well. 
Let me now talk about our cash deployment priorities. As I noted earlier, we are approaching R&D in a more strategic way by aligning it with our technology road map and investing in the most promising technologies. We will continue to spend about 3% of our revenues on R&D.
Turning now to M&A. We are stepping up activity in attractive growth areas and strengthening areas of strategic significance for us. We invested over $300 million in 8 acquisitions in 2017. Right now, we have about 20 companies of varying sizes in our pipeline. I think it is reasonable to say we can spend $1 billion a year in M&A. Moving forward, we are deploying most of our cash to build the company through M&A, and we will buy back shares to offset share creep as a secondary use of our cash. 
In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and professionalism of our employees. We have a terrific team at headquarters and across all segments that is executing on our strategy. We're embarking on a number of changes to the growth -- to grow the company over the long term, and we'll continue to improve our margins and deliver organic growth, quality earnings and strong free cash flow. 
In addition, we're going to accomplish this by keeping our eye on the ball, being customer-centric and never being satisfied as we pursue excellence every day.
Ralph will now take you through the financial performance and outlook, and then we'll take some questions."

I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and have reclassified to discontinued operations. 
Reviewing the fourth quarter, our results were generally in line with our outlook, with strong orders plus higher free cash flow and favorable tax items, mostly due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Admittedly, there are a few moving parts in our results, including the Vertex reclassification to discontinued operations, so we added a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from our midpoint guidance to our actual fourth quarter results in our website financial charts. 
So if you look at Page 5 of our web charts, you will see that our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.34, and it exceeded the midpoint guidance of -- by $1.12. The largest component of our higher EPS was a tax reform gain of $0.99. We also had a tax benefit of $0.38 from realigning our foreign legal entities. Partially offsetting these tax gains was charges of $0.24, mostly for new business integration and restructuring actions, which we took to further improve our core structure.
Fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $2.6 billion. Regarding the negative sales growth, you should recall that our accounting calendar added an extra week to our first quarter, which reversed in the fourth quarter, and everything else being equal, this lowered our growth rate by about 6 percentage points. Fourth quarter sales were on the high end of our outlook. Within the segments, DoD sales were solid, including the start of a new Compass Call recap program at Aerospace Systems and higher classified contract and airborne data link sales at Communication Systems. Soft market conditions continue to weigh on aviation security in Electronic Systems and commercial SATCOM in Communication Systems. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.2%, declining 50 basis points compared to the 2016 fourth quarter because of an increase in restructuring charges. 
As we previously explained, we are decisively pursuing our integration strategy. Our fourth quarter results included business integration and restructuring charges of $39 million, which lowered margin by 150 basis points. Almost $30 million of those restructuring charges were not anticipated in our last guidance update. The components of the $30 million are a $12 million asset write-down on our property containing one of our IR detector foundries that we will consolidate; a $4 million pension curtailment charge; $4 million of severance expansions to combine our 2 Canadian businesses in Aerospace; and approximately $10 million for incremental costs on in-process restructuring activities, primarily the Traveling-Wave Tube business consolidation in Communication Systems.
The IR foundry consolidation is a new restructuring action in Sensor Systems, which we expect to generate annual cost savings of about $9 million beginning toward the end of 2019. 
Regarding the pension curtailment, at our investor conference, Chris and I commented that we were evaluating our pension plans. And since then, we've decided to freeze substantially all of our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2009 (sic) [ January 1, 2019 ] to no longer accrue annual service credit. We expect this action to reduce our pension expense by at least $25 million in 2019. 
Communication Systems' margin was 7.8%. And excluding the $15 million of restructuring expenses there, it would have been 10.3%, slightly below our 2017 margin estimate. Communication Systems margin was also affected by the softness in the commercial satellite market, which caused lower overhead absorption and inventory provisioning in the space and power sector. 
Sensor Systems' margin was 10.9%. And without the foundry consolidation charge, its margin would have been 13.6% for the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was robust at $347 million, and it benefited from higher receivable collections. Orders were also very healthy at $2.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the fourth quarter and 1.04 for the full year 2017. 
Moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased our EPS midpoint by $0.67 to $9.40. The EPS increase is due to lower estimated taxes, with a tax rate now at 20% arising from the U.S. tax reform, which adds $0.80 to EPS, partially offset by $15 million of higher estimated pension expenses for 2018 based on the final December 31 pension assumptions, which subtracts $0.13 from EPS. Adjusting to exclude the 2017 tax reform gain, we expect 2018 EPS to grow about 11% over 2017. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains just under $10 billion, with expected growth of 4% over 2017. We maintained all of our 2018 segment guidance ranges, and we now expect growth over 2017 of 7% for Electronics, 2% for Communications, 12% for Sensors, and this growth is partially offset by a 4% decline at Aerospace.
Our updated operating margin guidance of 11.2% subtracts the higher pension expense, and we expect 2018 margin to increase 40 basis points versus 2017, with operating income growing 8%.
We also adjusted our 2018 margin guidance for 3 of our segments for the higher pension expense, and we now expect margins of 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11.1% for Communications, and we increased Sensor Systems margin by 30 basis points to 11.8%, unrelated to the pension expense.
Regarding free cash flow, we increased our estimate by $35 million to $900 million due to lower taxes, partially offset by an expectation of fewer receivable collections. 
Regarding capital allocation, after paying dividends, as Chris explained, we continue to favor acquisitions. During 2017, we invested $317 million on acquisitions. We also repurchased $89 million of our stock during the fourth quarter and $180 million for the full year 2017. We ended with a cash balance of $662 million and expect it to increase to $1.2 billion by the end of 2018 after paying our dividends and repurchasing $300 million of our stock in 2018 so that we will have plenty of firepower to make acquisitions.
Taking a quick look at the 2018 first quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion with operating margin in the low 10% range and diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had a very solid 2017. Compared to 2016, we grew orders 5%, sales 4%, operating income 7%, EPS 20% and free cash flow 3%. We also increased margins 30 basis points to 10.7%. We remain focused on continuously improving our operational and financial performance. In 2018, we will grow order sales and all the profit metrics, and we are also strategically executing our disciplined growth capital allocation plan and have ample liquidity to support those plans. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

First of all, instead of being solely focused on the earnings and cash metric, we're adding a third metric, which I'll be proposing to our Compensation Committee and Board in a few weeks, and that is one of organic growth. So the team will all be compensated on earnings, cash and growth. And then secondarily, we're going to have a mixed bonus where you will be compensated not only for how your entity does but the entity above you, which will drive collaboration. And then I reserved the right to make discretionary adjustments for cross-segment collaboration. So I think excellent question. And you get what you measure, and you pay what you measure.

I don't think there's a lot of guys that are growing year-over-year the way we are, and I think we're tracking. The decision on the pension, the defined benefit pension freeze, which, just to be clear, is effective January of '19, so in 11 months, that will kick in, that will be contributing favorably to our 2019 and beyond earnings. There's a lot of calculations and assumptions in that, but it's going to be at least $25 million based on what Ralph and I have seen for 2019. So that's going to obviously help us. And we're on a path to get to 12%. And as I continue to say and will continue to say, we're looking at long-term growth. We'll take restructuring charges. We'll take charges for layoffs. We'll take charges for selling facilities at a loss, and we will lower our earnings, as I told you in the October time frame, to increase R&D, as we have in Sensor Systems, for opportunity. So I like the trajectory we're on. I think we've hit everything we said we would, and we plan to continue with that. I don't know, Ralph, if there's anything further you want to add?"

And with respect to Communication Systems, your question was how do we get to our guidance for 2018, which is around 11%, from where we were in 2017? And there's basically 3 drivers of that. One, we expect that we're going to begin to realize cost savings or profit improvement from the Traveling-Wave Tube consolidation that we've been working on for the last 1.5 years. That's going to end in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect to generate about $7 million of savings from that consolidation in 2018. Additionally, I talked about the softness in the commercial satellite or commercial SATCOM market that we've been enduring in 2017, which caused low overhead absorption as well as some inventory reserving. So I don't expect that, that's going to recur in 2018. And then lastly..."

There's really 2 parts to it. The -- which I don't want to downplay. The first part is the nontraditional part, which I think aligns very well with the national security strategy and some of the initiatives that the secretary, board, and others have on the acquisition form. And it's really, I think, one of our key differentiators when we're talking about agility and innovation and speed to market. So that's the nontraditional piece. The 6th Prime, of course, is having us prime more work, or move up the food chain, or bundle our different systems into subsystems, subsystems into products and such. So that's kind of what I've laid out, and that's what the team has embraced. But relative to service by service, what I've said internally and publicly aligns with the strategy that our nation has on disaggregation. And as much as I'd love to have a multibillion-dollar bomber or a multibillion-dollar submarine or a multibillion-dollar ship, we're not going to have that. What we're going to do is support those, and our unmanned vehicles are a good example. So when we look at the Navy, we had 3 acquisitions last year to really get into a new market of unmanned undersea vehicles. And by all accounts, that's off to a great start. It's still in development. The meetings we're having in D.C. are very favorable. And I think there are hundreds, if not thousands, of UUV potential in the years and decades to come. So that's an example on the Navy strategy. With the Army, there's a whole push on soldier as a system. As you know, there's a whole Army modernization uptick, and I think we're going to have some progress there that we can talk about in the months ahead. And of course, with the Air Force, while we're platform-agnostic because we don't have a platform, I think when you look at some of the things we're doing in Aero, there's some great opportunities, whether it's a C-130-amp, there's some classified things we're doing, there's some things we're doing for the new presidential aircraft. But at the end of the day, we have, I think, the best ISR capabilities out there, and that's an area where we're going to continue to grow. And we do have some unmanned air vehicles, probably like everybody else, that they can't talk about. But that's the vision. And of course, sticking with the Air Force, the pilot training is an important part, and we made an acquisition a year ago, and I think we're the only company that actually does live training for the Air Force to get their pilots into the queue. So that's how we've laid it out. It's one of the things that Heidi Wood is spending a lot of time on as our Chief Strategy Officer, and we do have very unique and specific strategies that we're developing and implementing."

And then more importantly, as we look forward, when you look at the guidance we've given and the midpoints and such, we're over 10% year-over-year growth in Sensors and 7% in Electronics. So the thought of splitting this into 2, getting more focused on this strategy, closer to your customer, and integrating and collaborating is paying off, and you can see it in just 2 years. So I'm glad we did it, and we'll continue to look for other opportunities to realign for the benefit of the shareholders and the customers."

We're not happy, as I've said and Mike said even before I got here about where we are in Aero. It's a tough market. It's been shrinking, and it's a key year. The main focus is on Waco. We need to get more base in there, and we have a bid for the P-8 depot award. We expect 2 awards hopefully in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, and our goal is to get one of those 2 awards. And as you would imagine, this would replace the P-3 work that finished a couple of years ago. So strategically, I'd keep an eye on P-8. It's a slow ramp, but it will give us the base that is so important in these capital-intense facilities. The one I'm excited about is later in this year, is C-130-amp, and this is the avionics upgrade program for the C-130s. There's 3 or 4 competitors. You can probably guess who they are. And we've invested in some new avionic packages that are flying quite well on the C-130s, and it's a big cockpit upgrade. It's in our sweet spot, and the proposal is in. We'll know more in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure we'll go through the normal [ key-in ] process. And then we have a classified program that's pretty exciting. So I feel like we have opportunities in Waco. We have a couple of big proposals in, and that's something you guys and I and Mark Von Schwarz and others will be watching closely. Greenville is kind of the bread-and-butter of Aero, and they have a great tradition in ISR capability. And we had a big international award last year with some business jets. And there's 3 countries in the near term that we have discussions with, and those could be 2019 orders. And I think in the next 12 months, in addition to Mark and a few of us, I'll personally be visiting those 3 countries to let them know of our corporate commitment and the importance of that. And it's really about, I think, in the near term, fleet expansion. These ISR capabilities are so good, there's high demand given the threats in the world, and there really is a fair amount of short supply. So it's going to be a key year and a transitional year. We did mention that we're doing work on the new presidential aircraft for the mission communications system. So there's a whole lot out there. And then I'll just say on M&A, I mentioned we did 8. We've got a pipeline here. Everybody's focused on it. Every one of our core groups, core segments, has something. And just like the last 2 years, they vary from niche bolt-ons all the way up to what I like to say are more interesting acquisitions. But they're all under $0.5 billion, and there's a couple of international and mainly defense-related things. We did a lot of pilot training and security detection the last couple of years. So that's where we are. 
I guess if you want to email questions in, we seem to have some sort of technical difficulty, just email them to Heidi Wood. And someone is actually handing me a new iPhone 10 here that says, oh, from Carter Copeland. I guess I've got to read this out loud to myself and answer. 
Chris, here's a 2-part question. $30 million of incremental restructuring, this all just in the month of December, has been wondering specifically about the pace with which you and the rest of the team are identifying opportunities, whether they be on cost, talent, process improvement, M&A, you name it. Can you provide some insight on that perspective? And then secondly, the comment you made about widening the aperture of technology, can you elaborate on what that means for both your existing business as well as things you may want to acquire? Those are kind of cool, like I read myself a question from it. I'm going to have to get myself an iPhone 10. It's actually a nice large screen. 
So the first question, I guess, is the pace. Well, if anything isn't obvious, I like to go fast. My team likes to go fast. And I can assure you, we are going very fast. Three of the 4 group presidents have been in their job less than a year. We were all together just 2 days this week going through our plans and strategies. And it's -- just quicker is kind of our theme here. So we're taking out costs on the structuring. We'll continue to do that. We have some big wins that we need to get. But if they don't play out, we will have layoffs. We will restructure. We will move facilities. Clearly, we're working with the local states to get incentives where appropriate to help offset some of the costs. Selling the building for the gain out in California. We have another property we're looking at that's got a lot of interest, so we might do something creative there on a sale-leaseback. Everything's on the table. On the M&A side, we're not adverse to joint ventures. Again, the national security strategy talks a lot about partnerships around the globe, and I think we are in an incredibly unique position. We have great relationships in Europe and around the world. We're a trusted partner. And I think that's going to give us a strategic advantage as we seem to be well aligned. So on the M&A front, we did 8 last year. I have no issue doing 8 this year if they make sense, and we're looking at them. We have a couple that may be able to close in the next 60 days, and we'll keep you abreast on that. But we're all moving very, very quickly. 
And then the second question. He just deleted that. Someone -- can we go back to the second question? It was about widening the aperture on the technology. Well, that comes in a couple of forms. We -- there are some things we're looking at where we have to do a better job maybe tying in with commercial companies and taking their technologies to market. Some of these markets we're looking at and our customers want are literally hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of investment. So we're looking at how we can partner with some companies out in the West and bring them in to the Department of Defense. And we're also looking at different customers. It's the same old -- some of these ISR capabilities are world-class, and we tend to focus on 1 or 2 customers. But there's other services in the U.S., and there's international countries, so we're going to be much more aggressive on that front. So historically, our group president, maybe myself, have been focused on the internal operations and the financials, which will continue, but we're going to be traveling the globe. We're going to meet with customers. We're going to be meeting with members of Congress, and we're going to aggressively grow this company. Ralph?"

So we also received a follow-up question from Cai at Cowen regarding the underlying assumptions for our pension expense for 2018. So I'll quickly review those. So we basically had a few items that resulted in us increasing our estimated pension expense by $15 million for 2018. And even after that increase, we still anticipate that our year-over-year net pension expense, the FAS expense less the CAS recoveries, is going to decline by about $13 million. So with respect to discount rate, our discount rate has declined by about 60 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, so the assumption that we're using is 3.78%. And what happened there is not only did we see a reduction in the treasury yields, but there's also been a tightening of credit spreads, especially across the investment grade bonds, and that's what's driving the reduction in the discount rate. Fortunately, we had very good asset return in 2017, where the pension trust returned 15.5%, which is much better than our assumption, which is just under 8%. And we'll be assuming the same asset return-type assumption for 2018. So..."

And the recurring question is what is the impact of the CR, and I've taken the approach, which I believe in, is the biggest concern is the impact on our customers. And we all know the impact of a CR, the inability to have new starts, the inability to ramp up. And clearly, there's a strategy that's requiring certain systems. And when you can't provide them to the warfighter, I think they're the ones most harmed. And something that doesn't get a lot of attention in my opinion are the second, third and fourth-year subs. There's a lot of small companies that we all work with, especially L3, and we find ourself maybe propping these guys up financially with cash. So the bread and butter of our country are these small innovative businesses. And I've told you I think we're a federation of entrepreneurs, but much larger than some of these companies, and I don't think people understand and appreciate the impact they're having. So we're focusing on the supply chain and our customer. And then ultimately, everything I'm reading is there should be a budget in mid-February, maybe it slips a week or 2. And once that happens, it will be a matter of how quickly everyone can get the new contracts onto -- or the new orders on to contract. So 7 straight years, I think the industry has probably figured it out. It's the obvious stuff. We're not hiring people if we don't have business. We're trying to keep the R&D spend up. But it just puts a drag on the business. And we all know the situation around the world. The new strategy focuses more on our near peers than the terrorist threat, and that has different ramifications. There's a lot of discussion about having a more agile military, and I like that because I believe we're an agile company. There's a lot of discussions about [indiscernible] and partnerships. So that's the start with the strategy, and then it has to flow, just like a company, into the budget. And we'll be prepared to meet with our customer and try to get the stuff under contract as quickly as possible. So hopefully, that answers your question, Jon. And I think we'll take our last question next."

We do have a lot of business supporting primes and other partners on systems that may or may not be deployed internationally, so we don't throw that number in. But no, I think all the trends are good. There's been discussions about accelerating the licensing and the export approval process. And I think this is an area where we set up the boards. I'm looking at adding more talents in the international area. Because when you look at our portfolio and you look at the affordability and the agility of our systems, notwithstanding ISR as a larger one, there's a lot of need. And a lot of these countries have tight budgets. I was recently in Singapore and Japan and Taiwan. I've got some Mid East trips coming up in a few months. And we can get under contract quickly, and we have capabilities that they need. So things always take longer abroad, but I like the fact that the administration is aligning with industry in trying to get these things that are appropriate into our partners' and allies' hands. So that will be a focus of ours for 2018, as it was in 2017. And I'm just talking the military stuff. The commercial side, clearly, the pilot shortage is a global issue. We have training centers in Taiwan and the U.K. and are looking to expand elsewhere. So I feel real good about what we can do on the pilot training side internationally. In security and detection, as I've told some people, Europe is ahead of the U.S., which I think is unfortunate, as an American, to be lagging the rest of the world. So we're actually doing quite well in security and detection in Europe, and hopefully, our country catches up and gets some new systems in.

We're beginning an exciting new turn in the history of L3. 2018 kicks off a new era as we transition to L3 3.0. As you may have seen, we hit the ground running in early January with new organizational announcements. We're adding well-respected outside leaders to help us intensify our drive for growth and bring a fresh perspective. 
We'll be rolling out a number of new initiatives to further my 3 key themes for 2018: integration, collaboration and innovation. If we go back to our investor conference in December, we spoke about our focus in 2018 on better integrating the enterprise. This is a company with a lot of potential and a lot of work to be done. We are actively at work improving our processes; streamlining our procedures; deepening our L365 initiatives, which is our continuous improvement focus; and in some areas, moving and changing our people for improved growth and accountability.
We're positioning the company for higher margins this year, and at the same time, we're investing in new processes as well as getting more strategic on our technology road map. It's important to push open the aperture for more top line growth in the years ahead. 
I believe, and our segment presidents believe, we can be doing better across the board, and we're raising expectations to achieve that. I'm a big believer in continuous improvement, and we have embarked on a number of internal initiatives. 
Before we discuss our results, I want to touch quickly on the Defense budget. The recent vote to end the shutdown and fund the government for 3 weeks shows some progress, but it is still temporary. Like the rest of the industry, we are concerned about how the continuing resolution impacts the U.S. military's ability to plan and execute its mission. We will leverage our strength of agility and adaptability to support our customers as they navigate in this uncertain budget environment. We are watching the matter closely, and our guidance assumes that we don't have a protracted CR.
In terms of our financials, we had a good quarter and ended the year with increased sales, improved margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Our 2017 EPS and margins could have been higher, but we continue to make decisions to increase our efficiency and profitability by integrating and restructuring our businesses. As I've said before, we'll take a short-term onetime charge in exchange for recurring long-term profitable earnings growth. Ralph will explain some of the fourth quarter decisions in a few minutes. 
We entered the year with a goal of growing sales for the first time since the turn of the decade, and we accomplished that goal. I would also add that with the new tax law, we had a onetime gain of almost $80 million, and we will have a lower tax provision in the future. We're one of the few companies that recorded a gain from the tax reform due to our various tax planning strategies. 
We also increased our strong cash position, giving us the ability to grow our business through acquisitions and various organic growth initiatives. This is and will always be a priority for L3. 
Free cash flow and cash conversion are important metrics to me and the leadership team. It's a big part of how we evaluate our performance, and we'll be discussing it regularly in our conversations with you. At the same time, we are investing to drive more top line and earnings growth in the years ahead. We know where we're headed, and we're determined to become a nontraditional 6th Prime. We have the resources to execute this vision, and we will invest in new technologies that are vital to the warfighter and our commercial aviation customers. 
As we began 2018, our leadership team is energized, and we're starting from a unique position. We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lean corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strength. And we're pushing agility, technology and rapid adaptability deeper into our markets. We believe, and the world around us shows, that the future belongs not to the biggest but to the fastest. 
Operationally, we are integrating our businesses and internal systems to increase productivity and accelerate information flow. This will lead to more timely decisions and increased profitability. We are intensifying the focus on collaboration by bundling capabilities into total solutions as well as collaborating on technology developments and strategic pursuits. In addition, we are investing in areas that are aligned with the new national defense strategy. 
Across L3, we are developing advanced technologies in important growth markets to enhance our leadership position, including ISR, protected communications, sensors, night vision and airport security. We also have affordable and innovative solutions in both commercial and military pilot training. 
As we execute on our vision for L3, it is clear that some capabilities are no longer a good fit and would be better in another company. We've begun the sale process for Vertex, and we've seen a significant amount of interest in the business. We expect to receive initial indications of interest before the end of February and remain on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of this year. Divesting it will enable the Aerospace Systems leadership team to redirect their focus into areas where it is best suited to grow. We continually evaluate the portfolio based on market trends and outlook. 
Structurally, our business leaders have been working hard at sectorizing our divisions. By integrating and optimizing our sectors, we are creating businesses that have critical mass and are aligned with customer priorities. 
We are also taking steps to improve how we market ourselves internationally. At the beginning to this year, we established 3 new boards in Australia, Canada and the U.K. These boards will help our focus on growing more international business, strengthen customer relationships and support the thousands of employees who are working every day to meet the needs of our customers in these regions. Looking ahead, we have prioritized a dozen or so countries, primarily in the Middle East and Asia, and we're tailoring strategies for doing more business in each. 
Let's now turn to talent as I'm putting the right people in the right places. We've made some great additions to the management team. Sean Stackley has joined us as our Vice President of Strategic Advanced Programs and Technologies. Sean was a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was one of the most respected leaders in the Pentagon. We also brought on Pat O'Reilly as our Vice President of Corporate Engineering. Pat was the Director of the Missile Defense Agency and will help us expand our system engineering capabilities. John Feren recently joined us as the new Vice President of Business Development and Marketing. John is a well-recognized expert in commercial aviation and will help us better connect with customers in that market. Just last night, John was recognized as the face of aviation at the Dublin Airline Conference. So congratulations to John. And finally, we recently promoted Andy Ivers to lead our Communication Systems segment. Many of you got a chance to meet him at the investor conference, and he has done a great job running several businesses within Communication Systems and has consistently delivered strong operational and financial performance while maintaining the focus on our customers. Andy succeeds John Mega, who has been with L3 since the beginning and was instrumental in growing that segment into a multibillion-dollar business. After 44 years in the industry, John will be retiring, and we wish him well. 
Let me now talk about our cash deployment priorities. As I noted earlier, we are approaching R&D in a more strategic way by aligning it with our technology road map and investing in the most promising technology. We will continue to spend about 3% of our revenues on R&D.
Turning now to M&A. We are stepping up activity in attractive growth areas and strengthening areas of strategic significance for us. We invested over $300 million in 8 acquisitions in 2017. Right now, we have about 20 companies of varying sizes in our pipeline. I think it is reasonable to say we can spend $1 billion a year in M&A. Moving forward, we are deploying most of our cash to build the company through M&A, and we will buy back shares to offset share creep as a secondary use of our cash. 
In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and professionalism of our employees. We have a terrific team at headquarters and across all segments that is executing on our strategy. We're embarking on a number of changes to the growth -- to grow the company over the long term, and we'll continue to improve our margins and deliver organic growth, quality earnings and strong free cash flow. 
In addition, we're going to accomplish this by keeping our eye on the ball, being customer-centric and never being satisfied as we pursue excellence every day.
Ralph will now take you through the financial performance and outlook, and then we'll take some questions."

I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and have reclassifie",1120,"Thanks, Chris. 
I'll review some details about the fourth quarter and our 2018 guidance update. As a reminder, I will only discuss the company's continuing operations, which exclude the Vertex aerospace business, which we are selling and have reclassified to discontinued operations. 
Reviewing the fourth quarter, our results were generally in line with our outlook, with strong orders plus higher free cash flow and favorable tax items, mostly due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Admittedly, there are a few moving parts in our results, including the Vertex reclassification to discontinued operations, so we added a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from our midpoint guidance to our actual fourth quarter results in our website financial charts. 
So if you look at Page 5 of our web charts, you will see that our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.34, and it exceeded the midpoint guidance of -- by $1.12. The largest component of our higher EPS was a tax reform gain of $0.99. We also had a tax benefit of $0.38 from realigning our foreign legal entities. Partially offsetting these tax gains was charges of $0.24, mostly for new business integration and restructuring actions, which we took to further improve our core structure.
Fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $2.6 billion. Regarding the negative sales growth, you should recall that our accounting calendar added an extra week to our first quarter, which reversed in the fourth quarter. And everything else being equal, this lowered our growth rate by about 6 percentage points. Fourth quarter sales were on the high end of our outlook. Within the segments, DoD sales were solid, including the start of a new Compass Call recap program at Aerospace Systems and higher classified contract and airborne data link sales at Communication Systems. Soft market conditions continue to weigh on aviation security in Electronic Systems and commercial SATCOM in Communication Systems. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.2%, declining 50 basis points compared to the 2016 fourth quarter because of an increase in restructuring charges. 
As we previously explained, we are decisively pursuing our integration strategy. Our fourth quarter results included business integration and restructuring charges of $39 million, which lowered margin by 150 basis points. Almost $30 million of those restructuring charges were not anticipated in our last guidance update. The components of the $30 million are a $12 million asset write-down on our property containing one of our IR detector foundries that we will consolidate; a $4 million pension curtailment charge; $4 million of severance expansions to combine our 2 Canadian businesses in Aerospace; and approximately $10 million for incremental costs on in-process restructuring activities, primarily the Traveling-Wave Tube business consolidation in Communication Systems.
The IR foundry consolidation is a new restructuring action in Sensor Systems, which we expect to generate annual cost savings of about $9 million beginning toward the end of 2019. 
Regarding the pension curtailment, at our investor conference, Chris and I commented that we were evaluating our pension plans. And since then, we've decided to freeze substantially all of our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2009 (sic) [ January 1, 2019 ] to no longer accrue annual service credit. We expect this action to reduce our pension expense by at least $25 million in 2019. 
Communication Systems' margin was 7.8%. And excluding the $15 million of restructuring expenses there, it would have been 10.3%, slightly below our 2017 margin estimate. Communication Systems margin was also affected by the softness in the commercial satellite market, which caused lower overhead absorption and inventory provisioning in the space and power sector. 
Sensor Systems' margin was 10.9%. And without the foundry consolidation charge, its margin would have been 13.6% for the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was robust at $347 million, and it benefited from higher receivable collections. Orders were also very healthy at $2.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the fourth quarter and 1.04 for the full year 2017. 
Moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased our EPS midpoint by $0.67 to $9.40. The EPS increase is due to lower estimated taxes, with a tax rate now at 20% arising from the U.S. tax reform, which adds $0.80 to EPS, partially offset by $15 million of higher estimated pension expenses for 2018 based on the final December 31 pension assumptions, which subtracts $0.13 from EPS. Adjusting to exclude the 2017 tax reform gain, we expect 2018 EPS to grow about 11% over 2017. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains just under $10 billion, with expected growth of 4% over 2017. We maintained all of our 2018 segment guidance ranges, and we now expect growth over 2017 of 7% for Electronics, 2% for Communications, 12% for Sensors, and this growth is partially offset by a 4% decline at Aerospace.
Our updated operating margin guidance of 11.2% subtracts the higher pension expense, and we expect 2018 margin to increase 40 basis points versus 2017, with operating income growing 8%.
We also adjusted our 2018 margin guidance for 3 of our segments for the higher pension expense, and we now expect margins of 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11.1% for Communications, and we increased Sensor Systems margin by 30 basis points to 11.8%, unrelated to the pension expense.
Regarding free cash flow, we increased our estimate by $35 million to $900 million due to lower taxes, partially offset by an expectation of fewer receivable collections. 
Regarding capital allocation, after paying dividends, as Chris explained, we continue to favor acquisitions. During 2017, we invested $317 million on acquisitions. We also repurchased $89 million of our stock during the fourth quarter and $180 million for the full year 2017. We ended with a cash balance of $662 million and expect it to increase to $1.2 billion by the end of 2018 after paying our dividends and repurchasing $300 million of our stock in 2018 so that we will have plenty of firepower to make acquisitions.
Taking a quick look at the 2018 first quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion with operating margin in low 10% range and diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had a very solid 2017. Compared to 2016, we grew orders 5%, sales 4%, operating income 7%, EPS 20% and free cash flow 3%. We also increased margins 30 basis points to 10.7%. We remain focused on continuously improving our operational and financial performance. In 2018, we will grow order sales and all the profit metrics, and we are also strategically executing our disciplined growth capital allocation plan and have ample liquidity to support those plans. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

First of all, instead of being solely focused on the earnings and cash metric, we're adding a third metric, which I'll be proposing to our Compensation Committee and Board in a few weeks, and that is one of organic growth. So the team will all be compensated on earnings, cash and growth.

I don't think there's a lot of guys that are growing year-over-year the way we are, and I think we're tracking. The decision on the pension, the defined benefit pension freeze, which, just to be clear, is effective January of '19, so in 11 months, that will kick in, that will be contributing favorably to our 2019 and beyond earnings. There's a lot of calculations and assumptions in that, but it's going to be at least $25 million based on what Ralph and I have seen for 2019. So that's going to obviously help us. And we're on a path to get to 12%. And as I continue to say and will continue to say, we're looking at long-term growth. We'll take restructuring charges. We'll take charges for layoffs. We'll take charges for selling facilities at a loss, and we will lower our earnings, as I told you in the October time frame, to increase R&D, as we have in Sensor Systems, for opportunity. So I like the trajectory we're on. I think we've hit everything we said we would, and we plan to continue with that. I don't know, Ralph, if there's anything further you want to add."

That's going to end in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect to generate about $7 million of savings from that consolidation in 2018. Additionally, I talked about the softness in the commercial satellite or commercial SATCOM market that we've been enduring in 2017, which caused low overhead absorption as well as some inventory reserving.

And, Rob, I like your question because I've been using this phrase a lot, and we all have internally. There's really 2 parts to it. The -- which I don't want to downplay.

There's really 2 parts to it. The -- which I don't want to downplay. The first part is the nontraditional part, which I think aligns very well with the national security strategy and some of the initiatives that the secretary, board, and others have on the acquisition form. And it's really, I think, one of our key differentiators when we're talking about agility and innovation and speed to market. So that's the nontraditional piece. The 6th Prime, of course, is having us prime more work, or move up the food chain, or bundle our different systems into subsystems, subsystems into products and such. So that's kind of what I've laid out, and that's what the team has embraced. But relative to service by service, what I've said internally and publicly aligns with the strategy that our nation has on disaggregation. And as much as I'd love to have a multibillion-dollar bomber or a multibillion-dollar submarine or a multibillion-dollar ship, we're not going to have that. What we're going to do is support those, and our unmanned vehicles are a good example. So when we look at the Navy, we had 3 acquisitions last year to really get into a new market of unmanned undersea vehicles. And by all accounts, that's off to a great start. It's still in development. The meetings we're having in D.C. are very favorable. And I think there are hundreds, if not thousands, of UUV potential in the years and decades to come. So that's an example on the Navy strategy. With the Army, there's a whole push on soldier as a system. As you know, there's a whole Army modernization uptick, and I think we're going to have some progress there that we can talk about in the months ahead. And of course, with the Air Force, while we're platform-agnostic because we don't have a platform, I think when you look at some of the things we're doing in Aero, there's some great opportunities, whether it's a C-130-amp, there's some classified things we're doing. There's some things we're doing for the new presidential aircraft. But at the end of the day, we have, I think, the best ISR capabilities out there, and that's an area where we're going to continue to grow. And we do have some unmanned air vehicles, probably like everybody else, that they can't talk about. But that's the vision. And of course, sticking with the Air Force, the pilot training is an important part, and we made an acquisition a year ago, and I think we're the only company that actually does live training for the Air Force to get their pilots into the queue. So that's how we've laid it out. It's one of the things that Heidi Wood is spending a lot of time on as our Chief Strategy Officer, and we do have very unique and specific strategies that we're developing and implementing."

So that translates into about a $60 million reduction in income taxes. Most of it should turn into lower cash taxes. There could be some timing items, and so that's an increase to our free cash flow. And then I talked about offsetting some of that higher cash flow is the fact that we had very strong receivable collections in December of 2017. So we want to take a more conservative assumption with respect to the receivable collections in 2018. So those are the 2 moving parts, if you will, with respect to our free cash flow guidance for 2018."

We're not happy, as I've said and Mike said even before I got here about where we are in Aero. It's a tough market. It's been shrinking, and it's a key year. The main focus is on Waco. We need to get more base in there, and we have a bid for the P-8 depot award. We expect 2 awards hopefully in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, and our goal is to get one of those 2 awards. And as you would imagine, this would replace the P-3 work that finished a couple of years ago. So strategically, I'd keep an eye on P-8. It's a slow ramp, but it will give us the base that is so important in these capital-intense facilities. The one I'm excited about is later in this year, is C-130-amp, and this is the avionics upgrade program for the C-130s. There's 3 or 4 competitors. You can probably guess who they are. And we've invested in some new avionic packages that are flying quite well on the C-130s, and it's a big cockpit upgrade. It's in our sweet spot, and the proposal is in. We'll know more in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure we'll go through the normal [ key-in ] process. And then we have a classified program that's pretty exciting. So I feel like we have opportunities in Waco. We have a couple of big proposals in, and that's something you guys and I and Mark Von Schwarz and others will be watching closely. Greenville is kind of the bread-and-butter of Aero, and they have a great tradition in ISR capability. And we had a big international award last year with some business jets. And there's 3 countries in the near term that we have discussions with, and those could be 2019 orders. And I think in the next 12 months, in addition to Mark and a few of us, I'll personally be visiting those 3 countries to let them know of our corporate commitment and the importance of that. And it's really about, I think, in the near term, fleet expansion. These ISR capabilities are so good, there's high demand given the threats in the world, and there really is a fair amount of short supply. So it's going to be a key year and a transitional year. We did mention that we're doing work on the new presidential aircraft for the mission communications system. So there's a whole lot out there. And then I'll just say on M&A, I mentioned we did 8. We've got a pipeline here. Everybody's focused on it. Every one of our core groups, core segments, has something. And just like the last 2 years, they vary from niche bolt-ons all the way up to what I like to say are more interesting acquisitions. But they're all under $0.5 billion, and there's a couple of international and mainly defense-related things. We did a lot of pilot training and security detection the last couple of years. So that's where we are. 
I guess if you want to email questions in, we seem to have some sort of technical difficulty, just email them to Heidi Wood. And someone is actually handing me a new iPhone 10 here that says, oh, from Carter Copeland. I guess I've got to read this out loud to myself and answer. 
Chris, here's a 2-part question. $30 million of incremental restructuring, this all just in the month of December, has been wondering specifically about the pace with which you and the rest of the team are identifying opportunities, whether they be on cost, talent, process improvement, M&A, you name it. Can you provide some insight on that perspective? And then secondly, the comment you made about widening the aperture of technology, can you elaborate on what that means for both your existing business as well as things you may want to acquire? Those are kind of cool, like I read myself a question from it. I'm going to have to get myself an iPhone 10. It's actually a nice large screen. 
So the first question, I guess, is the pace. Well, if anything isn't obvious, I like to go fast. My team likes to go fast. And I can assure you, we are going very fast. Three of the 4 group presidents have been in their job less than a year. We were all together just 2 days this week going through our plans and strategies. And it's -- just quicker is kind of our theme here. So we're taking out costs on the structuring. We'll continue to do that. We have some big wins that we need to get. But if they don't play out, we will have layoffs. We will restructure. We will move facilities. Clearly, we're working with the local states to get incentives where appropriate to help offset some of the costs. Selling the building for the gain out in California. We have another property we're looking at that's got a lot of interest, so we might do something creative there on a sale-leaseback. Everything's on the table. On the M&A side, we're not adverse to joint ventures. Again, the national security strategy talks a lot about partnerships around the globe, and I think we are in an incredibly unique position. We have great relationships in Europe and around the world. We're a trusted partner. And I think that's going to give us a strategic advantage as we seem to be well aligned. So on the M&A front, we did 8 last year. I have no issue doing 8 this year if they make sense, and we're looking at them. We have a couple that may be able to close in the next 60 days, and we'll keep you abreast on that. But we're all moving very, very quickly. 
And then the second question. He just deleted that. Someone -- can we go back to the second question? It was about widening the aperture on the technology. Well, that comes in a couple of forms. We -- there are some things we're looking at where we have to do a better job maybe tying in with commercial companies and taking their technologies to market. Some of these markets we're looking at and our customers want are literally hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of investment. So we're looking at how we can partner with some companies out in the West and bring them in to the Department of Defense. And we're also looking at different customers. It's the same old -- some of these ISR capabilities are world-class, and we tend to focus on 1 or 2 customers. But there's other services in the U.S., and there's international countries, so we're going to be much more aggressive on that front. So historically, our group president, maybe myself, have been focused on the internal operations and the financials, which will continue, but we're going to be traveling the globe. We're going to meet with customers. We're going to be meeting with members of Congress, and we're going to aggressively grow this company. Ralph?"

So we also received a follow-up question from Cai at Cowen regarding the underlying assumptions for our pension expense for 2018. So I'll quickly review those. So we basically had a few items that resulted in us increasing our estimated pension expense by $15 million for 2018. And even after that increase, we still anticipate that our year-over-year net pension expense, the FAS expense less the CAS recoveries, is going to decline by about $13 million. So with respect to discount rate, our discount rate has declined by about 60 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, so the assumption that we're using is 3.78%. And what happened there is not only did we see a reduction in the treasury yields, but there's also been a tightening of credit spreads, especially across the investment grade bonds, and that's what's driving the reduction in the discount rate. Fortunately, we had very good asset return in 2017, where the pension trust returned 15.5%, which is much better than our assumption, which is just under 8%. And we'll be assuming the same asset return-type assumption for 2018. So..."

And the recurring question is what is the impact of the CR, and I've taken the approach, which I believe in, is the biggest concern is the impact on our customers. And we all know the impact of a CR, the inability to have new starts, the inability to ramp up. And clearly, there's a strategy that's requiring certain systems. And when you can't provide them to the warfighter, I think they're the ones most harmed. And something that doesn't get a lot of attention in my opinion are the second, third and fourth-year subs. There's a lot of small companies that we all work with, especially L3, and we find ourself maybe propping these guys up financially with cash. So the bread and butter of our country are these small innovative businesses. And I've told you I think we're a federation of entrepreneurs, but much larger than some of these companies, and I don't think people understand and appreciate the impact they're having. So we're focusing on the supply chain and our customer. And then ultimately, everything I'm reading is there should be a budget in mid-February, maybe it slips a week or 2. And once that happens, it will be a matter of how quickly everyone can get the new contracts onto -- or the new orders on to contract. So 7 straight years, I think the industry has probably figured it out. It's the obvious stuff. We're not hiring people if we don't have business. We're trying to keep the R&D spend up. But it just puts a drag on the business. And we all know the situation around the world. The new strategy focuses more on our near peers than the terrorist threat, and that has different ramifications. There's a lot of discussion about having a more agile military, and I like that because I believe we're an agile company. There's a lot of discussions about [indiscernible] and partnerships. So that's the start with the strategy, and then it has to flow, just like a company, into the budget. And we'll be prepared to meet with our customer and try to get the stuff under contract as quickly as possible. So hopefully, that answers your question, Jon. And I think we'll take our last question next."

We do have a lot of business supporting primes and other partners on systems that may or may not be deployed internationally, so we don't throw that number in. But no, I think all the trends are good. There's been discussions about accelerating the licensing and the export approval process. And I think this is an area where we set up the boards. I'm looking at adding more talents in the international area. Because when you look at our portfolio and you look at the affordability and the agility of our systems, notwithstanding ISR as a larger one, there's a lot of need. And a lot of these countries have tight budgets. I was recently in Singapore and Japan and Taiwan. I've got some Mid East trips coming up in a few months. And we can get under contract quickly, and we have capabilities that they need. So things always take longer abroad, but I like the fact that the administration is aligning with industry in trying to get these things that are appropriate into our partners' and allies' hands. So that will be a focus of ours for 2018, as it was in 2017. And I'm just talking the military stuff. The commercial side, clearly, the pilot shortage is a global issue. We have training centers in Taiwan and the U.K. and are looking to expand elsewhere. So I feel real good about what we can do on the pilot training side internationally. In security and detection, as I've told some people, Europe is ahead of the U.S., which I think is unfortunate, as an American, to be lagging the rest of the world. So we're actually doing quite well in security and detection in Europe, and hopefully, our country catches up and gets some new systems in.

A few months ago, I shared with you our vision of transforming L3 to become a best-in-class technology leader in the aerospace and defense industry. This is a multiyear journey that requires us to invest in our core capabilities, revitalize our culture and establish a deeper strategic relationship with our key customers. I have no doubt L3 will emerge a stronger company with higher sales growth, improved margins and increased cash flow. 
We are in year one of our transformation, and any transformation is normal to have some bumps along the way, but I am singularly focused on having everyone at L3 executing towards our long-term vision. 
We recently completed our first employee survey with a greater than 80% response rate, more than double the industry average. This illustrates the growing enthusiasm and engagement across the company for our new direction. Employees are energized, and everyday, I see our people gaining confidence and striving to achieve more.
Let me review our 3 staged paths that I highlighted in our Investor Day in December. 2018 is a transition and investment year where we focus on integration by laying the groundwork and building our infrastructure. We're optimizing our processes, our technologies and our talent to position us for future growth. In 2019, we expect these investments and our increased R&D to drive incremental organic sales growth. And our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as the nontraditional [indiscernible].
I would like to highlight the progress we made in Q1 towards our key priorities. Integration of the company is our most important priority this year. We are making progress towards upgrading our technology platforms, which will provide better visibility into the business, enable sharing and collaboration and extract deficiencies. 
We recently won the prestigious 2018 Innovation Award from SAP for our cloud-based enterprise data platform, one of the many leap-ahead technology initiatives that will drive better business performance.
We continue to sectorize business units and divisions to drive greater integration across the enterprise. The goal is not just to reduce costs, but to innovate faster, become more efficient and better serve our customers in a coordinated and collaborative way. Our shared services platform also continues to expand. 
As we highlighted during the Investor Day, we are progressing with indirect procurement, IT service tests and ERP systems into the platform this year. In addition, through various L3 L365 activities, our commitment to continuous improvement to be an advanced throughout the enterprise and across every functional area. 
Now turning to our workforce initiatives. We've had a busy quarter. We are implementing an action plan to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent in the business. We have many faced initiatives to drive increased employee collaboration and to better align employee activities with customer priorities. We changed our incentive compensation plan to add organic sales growth as a metric for the first time and created a mixed bonus pool to incentivize collaboration. 
As a reminder, last December, we made the decision to freeze our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2019. We estimate this action will reduce pension expense by at least $25 million beginning next year.
We continue to add great new people to our team. As you may have seen from a recent press release, Melanie [indiscernible] will be heading off our HR Department as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer. Melanie's more than 20 years of industry and consulting experience will contribute greatly to our L3 3.0 initiatives. 
Also, [ John Kim ] just joined us as Vice President of Investor Relations and Analytics, and he will be working closely with Ralph and Heidi. 
On the top the customer relationships, my team and I have been on the road extensively, actively listening to our Defense, Homeland Security and commercial aviation customers. We have been introducing them to the new L3, explaining our strategy and offering solutions to their needs and challenges. 
In the U.S., we have been spending time with key members of Congress, OSD, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. And internationally, we visited customers in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turning to our performance for the quarter. We exceeded our guidance and were pleased to report a strong 1.1 book-to-bill ratio, with all 4 segments above 1 0. We recently won the Royal Australian Navy's C1180 program, where we will supply and integrate a solution from the Communications, Electronics and Sensor segments. This is an example of improved collaboration and strategic positioning in the international arena. 
Other growth areas, such as our Security & Detection Systems and classified programs, had strong order bookings in the quarter. We also showed positive momentum in our commercial aviation business as we were awarded more flight simulator orders in this quarter than all of 2017, demonstrating our competitiveness in the growing pilot training market.
Two of our segments, Electronic Systems and Sensor Systems, demonstrated solid sales growth of 6% and [ 16% ], respectively. The focused R&D investments are beginning to contribute to our sales growth. The new leadership team installed at these segments last year are executing well. The growth at Electronic Systems and Sensors is broad-based, and we expect growth to remain strong the rest of the year. 
I was, however, disappointed with the results in our Communication Systems for the quarter. I expect the leadership team under the new President, [ Andy Ivers ], to make progress as the year unfolds. 
Turning to Aerospace Systems. Their financial performance was consistent with expectations. Our free cash flow is negative $85 million in Q1, in line with our internal plan and normal seasonality. We expect full year free cash flow to be consistent with prior guidance of $900 million and in line with our goal of approximately 120% free cash flow conversion.
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, M&A continues to be a priority. Last year, we invested over $300 million in acquisitions. Today's pipeline remains robust, and I expect our acquisition investments to be higher this year. 
Equipped divestiture update. As you saw this morning, we announced the deal to sell Vertex and some smaller aerospace units for $540 million cash. This transaction is expected to close sometime this summer. We will record a gain from this transaction with after-tax proceeds of approximately $400 million, which we will put to use based on our strategic priorities.
In closing, this quarter was the first step towards creating the new L3 3.0. There's a lot of work to do as we strive to make L3 an agile, leaner and more innovative and customer-centric company. I want to thank the entire L3 team for their commitment and dedication to the transformation and to the success of L3 and our customers. 
Now let me turn it over to Ralph, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook."
93538,558603562,1443708,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, [indiscernible] lower in",1164,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, [indiscernible] lower income taxes, which drove higher earnings per share.
First quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% to $2.34. Lower taxes were the largest component of EPS growth versus the 2017 first quarter, adding $0.27 to EPS. This occurred because of U.S. tax reform as well as increased stock option exercise related to retiring executives. 
You may recall that most of our tax deduction for stock-based compensation occur in the first quarter of each year due to our equity award vesting dates. 
Additionally, the higher first quarter stock option exercises is a nonrecurring item for the first half of 2018. 
First quarter sales increased 2% to $2,370,000,000. Sales growth was strong as Sensors and Electronics with each increasing 16% and 6%, respectively. Within Electronics, sales also grew 14% and Security & Detection Systems. At Aerospace, sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our full year estimate. 
At Communications Systems, sales were lower than we expected, decreasing 8%, primarily due to lower production volume on UAV contracts. Also in Communication Systems, consistent with our outlook, commercial SATCOM sales declined modestly because of the continued soft market demand for new satellites.
First quarter operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.6% and operating income increased 6%. Segment margins are tracking to our full year estimates. 
Communication Systems margin lagged in the first quarter at 7.5%, primarily because of lower sales and $5 million of restructuring expenses, which together lowered margin in the first quarter by about 270 basis points.
We expect Communication Systems margin to increase the rest of this year due to increasing sales, particularly in the second half of 2018, which will carry higher incremental margins, plus declining restructuring expenses and cost savings beginning to be realized from our restructuring actions. 
Sensor Systems margins declined to 12%, primarily due to higher R&D expenses. And as Chris explained, those are for our planned incremental growth investments this year.
Free cash flow was a negative $85 million for the first quarter due to seasonal increases in receivables and inventories that will reverse later this year. We also made deposits for aircraft purchases on new ISR recap programs for which we will be paid later this year, and we're also increasing capital expenditures this year versus 2017 to support growth in our simulation and training businesses. And that increase in CapEx is pronounced more into earlier in the year.
First quarter funded orders grew 10% to $2.6 [ billion]. And as Chris noted, the book-to-bill was 1.11, which supports the accelerating quarterly sales growth that we expect this year. 
Now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased EPS by $0.10 to $9.50 at the midpoint, primarily for lower taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, we expect EPS to grow 12% for 2018 compared to 2017. 
We maintained our sales and operating margin guidance ranges. We expect consolidated sales of about $10 billion at the midpoint, with 4% growth over 2017. 
At the segment level, sales are trending above the guided midpoints for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors. 
Aerospace guidance also contemplates the divestiture of the [indiscernible] and TCS businesses, which were sold with Vertex. Conversely, for Communications, sales are presently trending to the low end of guidance due to slower U.S. military awards and orders on next-generation C3 systems, protected communications and [indiscernible] communication terminals, which is pushing some sales to next year. 
Additionally, this year, our board banking communication sector is beginning new work on several next-generation LPI, LPD and MultiLink secured communications, which are high engineering and development content and, initially, have lower volumes before they transition to production in the future.
We also expect to book new production orders in the second half of 2018, including for UAV communications, that will generate sales in 2019.
On the operating margins, we continue to expect consolidated margin of 11.2% for 2018, which will increase 40 basis points compared to 2017 with operating income growth of 8%. Our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints remain at 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11% for Communications and 11.8% for Sensors.
I also want to provide a quick update on our business integration and restructuring. As you know, this is a focus area for Chris, me and our segment presidents and CFOs. We still expect to incur about $30 million of restructuring and services expenses this year, with an offsetting $15 million of cost savings from our restructuring actions. 
Additionally, depending on the outcome of new business pursuits in Aerospace, we will need to take additional action there later in the year, and our current guidance margin covers this potential additional restructuring. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered our tax estimate to 19%. That is a 19% tax rate factoring in the lower first quarter taxes. And we continue to expect free cash flow of [ $900 ] million for 2018. Our guidance now includes $10 million more of operating cash flow offset by $10 million more of capital expenditures. 
Regarding capital allocation. After paying our dividends and repurchasing stock to offset growth and shares outstanding, we continue to favor acquisitions. We repurchased [ 119 ] million of stock in the first quarter, and we plan to repurchase [ 300 ] million for 2018. We have a strong balance sheet with ample resources to make acquisitions. And recently, both Fitch and S&P affirmed that BBB- credit ratings and stable outlooks for L3. 
Additionally, our guidance update does not include benefits from deploying the proceeds from the sale of the Vertex businesses, which we announced today. And as Chris explained, we expect net cash proceeds of about $400 million. 
Looking at the 2018 second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion, which calculates of sales growth of 4%, operating margin of 11% and diluted earnings per share between $2.35 and $2.45. 
Regarding our second quarter margin, it will be lower than what we reported in the 2017 second quarter because it included -- we had a property sale gain in last year's second quarter of $42 million, which increased consolidated operating margin by 180 basis points. Excluding that 2017 property again, we expect 2018 second quarter margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, our first quarter was a good start to the year. We grew orders, sales, operating income and earnings per share. We also increased margin by 40 basis points while investing more in R&D. We remain focused on improving our operational and financial performance for the full year 2018. We expect to grow orders, sales, all the profit metrics and cash flow. We are also strategically allocating capital and have ample liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

We've been investing for over a decade in some pretty unique solutions. I think we have some of the top talent in the nation, especially in Salt Lake City, working on these communication challenges. And I think there is a customer awareness that this is one of the biggest challenges facing the country, and it's not unusual for the communications to lag the platform procurement. But I think it's pretty well-known and documented fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft can't communicate in a covert way. And if you look at our national defense strategy and some of the challenges that have been laid out, this is clearly an area that's going to get attention. So it's a long year. We've got 1 quarter behind us. As I said, it wasn't as good as I would've liked. But I think with leadership and our new technologies and some of the development work that we won early in the year, we're well positioned for the long term.

Throughout the rest of Aerospace, we had a pretty good quarter, a lot of classified additions, there are some additional aircraft that will be coming through the budget process, either major modifications to existing aircraft or some new aircraft. So I think we're looking pretty good there. On the international trips, there's a lot of interest, especially in the Mideast for our ISR platforms. So if you see some of the national defense strategy, there's a lot of talk about ISR and the need for that capability. And of course, that's in our sweet spot. And the Canadian FA team that we talked about for a year or so exercised their second option, and we also got an [indiscernible] work down in Aero. So seems like things have stabilized and started to position us for longer-term growth in Aero. And then on the other segments, Electronics and Sensors, we talked a little bit about. But Electronics, very good quarter on orders with Security & Detection, having growth as we have been successful with various airports around the world. A lot in the classified arena that we have positioned engagement systems and even with the Navy on our power and propulsion solutions. In Sensors, we have a couple being announced in the second quarter, but again, they had a great quarter, [ 16% ] top line growth. A lot of interest in our airborne [indiscernible] systems, our infrared detection systems and our electronic warfare countermeasures. So the R&D that we're spending in those areas are starting to pay off and couldn't be happier with 1.1 book-to-bill ratio to start the year and bodes well for the rest of the year [ and ] 2019."

No, you're right on the structure we tend to have more fixed price work than maybe the other companies. So there's really 2 opportunities. The #1 way to improve margins, in my opinion, has always been to increase the denominator and to grow, and I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability. And that's why we rolled out our disciplined growth strategy. And myself and my team and others have been aggressively out their meeting with customers, both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end users to try to jump-start the growth. So the volume will improve the profitability. And then, of course, as we continue to reduce costs, I mean, this year, we're investing, and that's a lot in our IT systems. I mentioned the SAP award, which we're quite out of. We'll start to see those pay off in '19 and beyond. So it's kind of the old-fashioned cost reduction and more top line sales will improve that profitability. And the team is focused on that, and we're making progress. Unfortunately, we had a rift in Salt Lake City, eliminated up to 140 positions, which again is part of our Comm segment. So we'll continue to do that with just with business and make sense and as we continue to consolidate our divisions and our sectors. On the second question, I think we've been consistent in saying that we can seasonally make $1 billion of acquisitions a year and still protect our investment-grade credit rating. So whether it's a $1 billion or two half a billion or [ 10 hundred million ], we're looking at everything. We continue to look at it strategically, and I think we're doing a pretty good job aligning our portfolio with the defense strategy. I give Secretary of Defense [indiscernible] credit. I think it's the first time DoD had had a strategic review in 20 years, at least that's what he's been quoted as saying. So we all see where he's going and what capabilities he needs. And we'll be happy to do larger acquisitions if they make sense strategically and operationally and financially. And..."

But first and foremost, we are a growth company. We're trying to grow the top line. We're trying to grow the bottom line. We can have $1.1 billion of EBIT this year. My goal is to get $1.2 billion in 2019 and continue to grow and get more earnings. I think we all know generally in this industry and especially at L3, the earnings does impact and convert into free cash flow. I think as I look back, we've averaged 120% free cash flow conversion rate, one of the better rates in the industry or the industrials. So ultimately, we're a compounder of free cash flow, and that's consistent with our strategy. We're going to make acquisitions. Some of these will be early-stage companies. Some of these will have amortization of intangibles, which will artificially lower the margins maybe in the near term. R&D, we've been very aggressive in R&D. It's no coincidence. But Sensors grew 16%, and it's just 1 quarter, but they could be -- had a great year. And I think it was the third quarter of last year that I said we're increasing in R&D, and we're starting to see it pay off. We made investments in Security & Detection and the equipment, allowing people to carry on liquids and laptops. And now we're starting to see orders there. We made investments in our simulator business, and we're really on a roll in that regard. So the focus -- everything we decide, it's a balanced approach. But I've said before, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company long term. I have no problem taking onetime severance, for restructuring, investing in R&D or making acquisitions that may dilute the margins in the short term but positions us in long term. But notwithstanding that, we're committed to the 12% target in 12, and we'll keep going with more volume and some of the transformational investments we're making on our internal systems will accelerate that. So that's how we're looking at it. That's how we're running the business, and that's how we'll continue to succeed."

I think a lot of the airlines are looking at outsourcing or selling their training school houses or capabilities and putting those pilots to work generating revenue and looking for companies like L3 to take overlap. So we have a couple of those were in discussions with that could require some upfront capital. And Security & Detection, we're always looking there. We have a new leader starting this past January.

So when you have such a high score in that regard, you know you've got a great workforce and you know they love they're doing. Everything else was focused more on the need for consistent tools, more integration, a refresh on talent and how to move the company to continue your career. So probably couldn't have asked for better results from the employee survey, but we still got to go ahead and develop an action plan. And with Melanie joining us, we're going to lay that out and move forward. I guess I like to go generally pretty fast in everything I do. And I get the sense that the team, the team wants to even go faster than me, which is exciting. We keep bringing in new people, and they just see the opportunity and the excitement. And you know some of the external hires we've had and there's lots of options with people want to jump on the L3 bandwagon because what we're doing is unique and different and makes a difference. So just as a general comment, we're doing a lot in the IT world. And I don't want to overplay, but to get that SAP award, I was quite proud of. And again, we like to be our leader. We're the first defense contractor to be on Office 365, which is a secured government cloud. So no other got contractor has done that. We're going to save money. We have better capabilities.

A few months ago, I shared with you our vision of transforming L3 to become a best-in-class technology leader in the aerospace and defense industry. This is a multiyear journey that requires us to invest in our core capabilities, revitalize our culture and establish a deeper strategic relationship with our key customers. I have no doubt L3 will emerge a stronger company with higher sales growth, improved margins and increased cash flow. 
We are in year one of our transformation, and any transformation is normal to have some bumps along the way, but I am singularly focused on having everyone at L3 executing towards our long-term vision. 
We recently completed our first employee survey with a greater than 80% response rate, more than double the industry average. This illustrates the growing enthusiasm and engagement across the company for our new direction. Employees are energized, and everyday, I see our people gaining confidence and striving to achieve more.
Let me review our 3-stage path that I highlighted in our Investor Day in December. 2018 is a transition and investment year where we focused on integration by laying the groundwork and building our infrastructure. We're optimizing our processes, our technologies and our talent to position us for future growth. In 2019, we expect these investments and our increased R&D to drive incremental organic sales growth. And our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as the nontraditional 6th Prime.
I would like to highlight the progress we made in Q1 towards our key priorities. Integration of the company is our most important priority this year. We are making progress towards upgrading our technology platforms, which will provide better visibility into the business, enable information sharing and collaboration and extract deficiencies. 
We recently won the prestigious 2018 Innovation Award from SAP for our cloud-based enterprise data platform, one of the many leap-ahead technology initiatives that will drive better business performance.
We continue to sectorize business units and divisions to drive greater integration across the enterprise. The goal is not just to reduce costs, but to innovate faster, become more efficient and better serve our customers in a coordinated and collaborative way. Our shared services platform also continues to expand. 
As we highlighted during the Investor Day, we are progressing with indirect procurement, IT service tests and ERP systems into the platform this year. In addition, through various L365 activities, our commitment to continuous improvement is being advanced throughout the enterprise and across every functional area. 
Now turning to our workforce initiatives. We've had a busy quarter. We are implementing an action plan to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent in the business. We have many phased initiatives to drive increased employee collaboration, and to better align employee activities with customer priorities. We changed our incentive compensation plan to add organic sales growth as a metric for the first time and created a mixed bonus pool to incentivize collaboration. 
As a reminder, last December, we made the decision to freeze our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2019. We estimate this action will reduce pension expense by at least $25 million beginning next year.
We continue to add great new people to our team. As you may have seen from our recent press release, Melanie Heitkamp will be heading off our HR Department as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer. Melanie's more than 20 years of industry and consulting experience will contribute greatly to our L3 3.0 initiatives. 
Also, John Kim just joined us as Vice President of Investor Relations and Analytics, and he will be working closely with Ralph and Heidi. 
On the top of good customer relationships, my team and I have been on the road extensively, actively listening to our Defense, Homeland Security and commercial aviation customers. We have been introducing them to the new L3, explaining our strategy and offering solutions to their needs and challenges. 
In the U.S., we have been spending time with key members of Congress, OSD, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. And internationally, we visited customers in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turning to our performance for the quarter. We exceeded our guidance and were pleased to report a strong 1.1x book-to-bill ratio, with all 4 segments above 1.0. We recently won the Royal Australian Navy's SEA 1180 program, where we will supply and integrate a solution from the Communications, Electronics and Sensor segments. This is an example of improved collaboration and strategic positioning in the international arena. 
Other growth areas, such as our Security & Detection Systems and classified programs, had strong order bookings in the quarter. We also showed positive momentum in our commercial aviation business as we were awarded more flight simulator orders in this quarter than all of 2017, demonstrating our competitiveness in the growing pilot training market.
Two of our segments, Electronic Systems and Sensor Systems, demonstrated solid sales growth of 6% and 16%, respectively. The focused R&D investments are beginning to contribute to our sales growth. The new leadership team installed at these segments last year are executing well. The growth at Electronic Systems and Sensors is broad-based, and we expect growth to remain strong the rest of the year. 
I was, however, disappointed with the results in our Communication Systems for the quarter. I expect the leadership team under the new President, Andy Ivers, to make progress as the year unfolds. 
Turning to Aerospace Systems. Their financial performance was consistent with expectations. Our free cash flow is negative $85 million in Q1, in line with our internal plan and normal seasonality. We expect full year free cash flow to be consistent with prior guidance of $900 million and in line with our goal of approximately 120% free cash flow conversion.
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, M&A continues to be a priority. Last year, we invested over $300 million in acquisitions. Today's pipeline remains robust, and I expect our acquisition investments to be higher this year. 
Equipped divestiture update. As you saw this morning, we announced the deal to sell Vertex and some smaller aerospace units for $540 million cash. This transaction is expected to close sometime this summer. We will record a gain from this transaction with after-tax proceeds of approximately $400 million, which we will put to use based on our strategic priorities.
In closing, this quarter was the first step towards creating the new L3 3.0. There's a lot of work to do as we strive to make L3 an agile, leaner and more innovative and customer-centric company. I want to thank the entire L3 team for their commitment and dedication to this transformation and to the success of L3 and our customers. 
Now let me turn it over to Ralph, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook."

I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, lower income taxes, which drove higher earnings per share.
First quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% to $2.34. Lower taxes were the largest component of EPS growth versus the 2017 first quarter, adding $0.27 to EPS. This occurred because of U.S. tax reform as well as increased stock option exercise related to retiring executives. 
You may recall that most of our tax deduction for stock-based compensation occur in the first quarter of each year due to our equity award vesting dates. 
Additionally, the higher first quarter stock option exercises is a nonrecurring item for the first half of 2018
First quarter sales increased 2% to $2,370,000,000. Sales growth was strong as Sensors and Electronics with each increasing 16% and 6%, respectively. Within Electronics, sales also grew 14% in Security & Detection Systems. At Aerospace, sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our full year estimate. 
At Communications Systems, sales were lower than we expected, decreasing 8%, primarily due to lower production volume on UAV contracts. Also in Communication Systems, consistent with our outlook, commercial SATCOM sales declined modestly because of the continued soft market demand for new satellites.
First quarter operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.6% and operating income increased 6%. Segment margins are tracking to our full year estimates. 
Communication Systems margin lagged in the first quarter at 7.5%, primarily because of lower sales and $5 million of restructuring expenses, which together lowered margin in the first quarter by about 270 basis points.
We expect Communication Systems margin to increase rest of this year due to increasing sales, particularly in the second half of 2018, which will carry higher incremental margins, plus declining restructuring expenses and cost savings beginning to be realized from our restructuring actions. 
Sensor Systems margins declined to 12%, primarily due to higher R&D expenses. And as Chris explained, those are for our planned incremental growth investments this year.
Free cash flow was a negative $85 million for the first quarter due to seasonal increases in receivables and inventories that will reverse later this year. We also made deposits for aircraft purchases on new ISR recap programs for which we will be paid later this year. And we're also increasing capital expenditures this year versus 2017 to support growth in our simulation and training businesses. And that increase in CapEx is pronounced more in the -- earlier in the year.
First quarter funded orders grew 10% to $2.6 billion. And as Chris noted, the book-to-bill was 1.11x, which supports the accelerating quarterly sales growth that we expect this year. 
Now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased EPS by $0.10 to $9.50 at the midpoint, primarily for lower taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, we expect EPS to grow 12% for 2018 compared to 2017. 
We maintained our sales and operating margin guidance ranges. We expect consolidated sales of about $10 billion at the midpoint, with 4% growth over 2017. 
At the segment level, sales are trending above the guided midpoints for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors. 
Aerospace guidance also contemplates the divestiture of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which were sold with Vertex. Conversely, for Communications, sales are presently trending to the low end of guidance due to slower U.S. military awards and orders on next-generation C3 systems, protected communications and tactical communication terminals, which is pushing some sales to next year. 
Additionally, this year, our broadband communication sector is beginning new work on several next-generation LPI, LPD and MultiLink secured communications, which are high engineering and development content, and initially have lower volumes before they transition to production in the future.
We also expect to book new production orders in the second half of 2018, including for UAV communications, that will generate sales in 2019.
On the operating margins, we continue to expect consolidated margin of 11.2% for 2018, which will increase 40 basis points compared to 2017 with operating income growth of 8%. Our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints remain at 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11% for Communications and 11.8% for Sensors.
I also want to provide a quick update on our business integration and restructuring. As you know, this is a focus area for Chris, me and our segment presidents and CFOs. We still expect to incur about $30 million of restructuring and services expenses this year, with an offsetting $15 million of cost savings from our restructuring actions. 
Additionally, depending on the outcome of new business pursuits in Aerospace, we will need to take additional action there later in the year, and our current guidance margin covers this potential additional restructuring. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered our tax estimate to 19%. That is a 19% tax rate factoring in the lower first quarter taxes. And we continue to expect free cash flow of $900 million for 2018. Our guidance now includes $10 million more of operating cash flow offset by $10 million more of capital expenditures. 
Regarding capital allocation. After paying our dividends and repurchasing stock to offset growth and shares outstanding, we continue to favor acquisitions. We repurchased $119 million of stock in the first quarter, and we plan to repurchase $300 million for 2018. We have a strong balance sheet with ample resources to make acquisitions. And recently, both Fitch and S&P affirmed that BBB- credit ratings and stable outlooks for L3. 
Additionally, our guidance update does not include benefits from deploying the proceeds from the sale of the Vertex businesses, which we announced today. And as Chris explained, we expect net cash proceeds of about $400 million. 
Looking at the 2018 second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion, which calculates sales growth of 4%, operating margin of 11% and diluted earnings per share between $2.35 and $2.45. 
Regarding our second quarter margin, it will be lower than what we reported in the 2017 second quarter, because it included -- we had a property sale gain in last year's second quarter of $42 million, which increased consolidated operating margin by 180 basis points. Excluding that 2017 property gain, we expect 2018 second quarter margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, our first quarter was a good start to the year. We grew orders, sales, operating income and earnings per share. We also increased margin by 40 basis points while investing more in R&D. We remained focused on improving our operational and financial performance. For the full year 2018, we expect to grow orders, sales, all the profit metrics and cash flow. We are also strategically allocating capital and have ample liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

But I think it's pretty well-known and documented that fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft can't communicate in a covert way. And if you look at our national defense strategy and some of the challenges that have been laid out, this is clearly an area that's going to get attention. So it's a long year. We've got one quarter behind us. As I said, it wasn't as good as I would've liked. But I think with new leadership and our technologies, and some of the development work that we won early in the year, we're well positioned for the long term. And it's the -- every time I'm in the Pentagon, the discussion on multidomain command and control is on the top of everybody's mind. And I think we're uniquely positioned to help in that challenge."

Throughout the rest of Aerospace, we had a pretty good quarter, a lot of classified additions. There's some additional aircraft that will be coming through the budget process, either major modifications to existing aircraft or some new aircraft. So I think we're looking pretty good there. On the international trips, there's a lot of interest, especially in the Mideast for our ISR platforms. So if you see some of the national defense strategy, there's a lot of talk about ISR and the need for that capability. And of course, that's in our sweet spot. And the Canadian F-18 that we've talked about for a year or so exercised their second option, and we also got a E-6B work down in Aero. So seems like things have stabilized and started to position us for longer-term growth in Aero. And then on the other segments, Electronics and Sensors, we talked a little bit about. But Electronics, very, very good quarter on orders with Security & Detection, having growth as we have been successful with various airports around the world. A lot in the classified arena that we have in procession engagement systems and even with the Navy on our Power & Propulsion solutions. In Sensors, we have a couple that again close to being announced during the second quarter, but again, they had a great quarter, 16% top line growth. A lot of interest in our airborne turret systems, our infrared detection systems and our electronic warfare countermeasures. So the R&D that we're spending in those areas are starting to pay off and couldn't be happier with 1.1x book-to-bill ratio to start the year and bodes well for the rest of the year and 2019."

No, you're right on the contract structure we tend to have more fixed-price work than maybe the other companies. So there's really 2 opportunities. The #1 way to improve margins, in my opinion, has always been to increase the denominator and to grow. And I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability. And that's why we've rolled out our disciplined growth strategy. And myself and my team and others have been aggressively out their meeting with customers, both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end users to try to jump-start the growth. So the volume will improve the profitability. And then, of course, as we continue to reduce costs, I mean, this year, we're investing, and that's a lot in our IT systems, I mentioned the SAP award, which we're quite out of. We'll start to see those pay off in '19 and beyond. So it's kind of the old-fashioned cost reduction and more top line sales will improve that profitability. And the team is focused on that, and we're making progress. Unfortunately, we had -- have a rift in Salt Lake City, eliminated up to 140 positions, which again is part of our Comm segment. So we'll continue to do that where the business make sense and as we continue to consolidate our divisions and our sectors. 
On the second question, I think we've been consistent in saying that we can easily make $1 billion of acquisitions a year and still protect our investment-grade credit rating. So whether it's a $1 billion or 2 $0.5 billion or 10 $100 million, we're looking at everything. We continue to look at it strategically, and I think we're doing a pretty good job aligning our portfolio with the defense strategy. I give Secretary of Defense, Mattis, credit. I think it was the first time the DoD has -- had a strategic review in 20 years, at least that's what he's been quoted as saying. So we all see where he's going and what capabilities he needs. And we'll be happy to do larger acquisitions if they make sense strategically and operationally and financially. And..."

So where we saw a particular strength in Electronic Systems, it's mostly coming out in the [indiscernible] accounts and the RDT&E accounts as well as increases that we're seeing in terms of replenishing or refilling munition bins, if you will, or some of that comes out of the O&M account as well. So I guess more of it is going to come from the investment accounts, and we're about 50% now investment versus O&M."

Jon, I think this is a great question, and I think I try to be consistent on this, and I think it's important to clarify, and I fully appreciate the importance of margins, and we're working hard in that regard. But first and foremost, we are a growth company. We're trying to grow the top line. We're trying to grow the bottom line. We going to have $1.1 billion of EBIT this year. My goal is to get $1.2 billion in 2019 and continue to grow and get more earnings. I think we all know generally in this industry and especially at L3, the earnings does impact and burden the free cash flow. I think as I've looked back, we've averaged 120% free cash flow conversion rate, one of the better rates in the industry or the industrials. So ultimately, we're a compounder of free cash flow, and that's consistent with our strategy. We're going to make acquisitions. Some of these will be early-stage companies. Some of these will have amortization of intangibles, which will artificially lower the margins maybe in the near term. R&D, we've been very aggressive in R&D. It's no coincidence. Sensors grew 16%, and it's just 1 quarter, but they could be -- that -- have a great year. And I think it was the third quarter of last year, as I have said, we're increasing in R&D, and we're starting to see it pay off. We made investments in Security & Detection and the equipment, allowing people to carry on liquids and laptops. And now we're starting to see orders there. We've made investments in our simulator business, and we're really on a roll in that regard. So the focus -- everything we decide, it's a balanced approach. But as I've said before, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company long term. I have no problem taking onetime charges for severance, for restructuring, investing in R&D or making acquisitions that may dilute the margins in the short term but positions us in long term. But notwithstanding that, we're committed to the 12% target in 12, and we'll keep going with more volume and some of the transformational investments we're making on our internal systems will accelerate that. So that's how we're looking at it. That's how we're running the business, and that's how we're going to continue to succeed."

I mean, it just surprised all of the professionals who do this for a living. But one of the things that I was most proud of was this category that they call sustainable engagement. And we were above industry standards. What basically means our employees have a sense of purpose, they enjoy working and they're willing to go the extra mile, and that's the hardest thing to change. So when you have such a high score in that regard, you know you've got a great workforce and you know they love what they're doing. Everything else was focused more on the need for consistent tools, more integration, a refresh on talent and how to move amongst the company to just to continue your career. So probably couldn't have asked for better results from the employee survey, but we still got to go ahead and develop an action plan. And with Melanie joining us, we're going to lay that out and move forward. I guess I like to go generally pretty fast in everything I do. And I get the sense that the team wants to even go faster than me, which is exciting. We keep bringing in new people, and they just see the opportunity and the excitement. And you know some of the external hires we've had and there's lots of options, but people want to jump on the L3 bandwagon because what we're doing is unique and different and makes a difference. So it's just a general comment, we're doing a lot in the IT world. And I don't want to overplay, but to get that SAP award, I was quite proud of. And again, we like to be a leader. We're the first defense contractor to be on Office 365, which is a secured government cloud. So no other contractor has done that. We're going to save money. We have better capabilities. We have more security. And we're also work in IaaS, which is an Infrastructure as a Service, and we cut a 5-year deal with Microsoft. So we're dealing with all the leaders in technology. They like working with L3, and we're willing to take the risk and the chance to go with these new innovative leap-ahead technologies. And I think it's very exciting and the team is excited about it. And I'm pretty sure others are trying to figure out what we're doing and how they can replicate it. And it's good to be a leader, and I'm sure others follow."

I mentioned just 1 or 2 wins, and we're seeing more and more of these cross segments and sectors, and we're getting the bigger piece of the pie in a coordinated way, usually working for the primes. And I think they like our new approach and they like L3 coming to them as a single entity with a portfolio of solutions. They get better pricing. We get to sell our capabilities in a coordinated manner. So I think it's all good. Our gut tells us that we have more opportunities in the pipeline today than we did. We've opened the aperture.

A few months ago, I shared with you our vision of transforming L3 to become a best-in-class technology leader in the aerospace and defense industry. This is a multiyear journey that requires us to invest in our core capabilities, revitalize our culture and establish a deeper strategic relationship with our key customers. I have no doubt L3 will emerge a stronger company with higher sales growth, improved margins and increased cash flow. 
We are in year one of our transformation, and in any transformation it's normal to have some bumps along the way, but I am singularly focused on having everyone at L3 executing towards our long-term vision. 
We recently completed our first employee survey with a greater than 80% response rate, more than double the industry average. This illustrates the growing enthusiasm and engagement across the company for our new direction. Employees are energized, and everyday, I see our people gaining confidence and striving to achieve more.
Let me review our 3-stage path that I highlighted in our Investor Day in December. 2018 is a transition and investment year where we focused on integration by laying the groundwork and building our infrastructure. We're optimizing our processes, our technologies and our talent to position us for future growth. In 2019, we expect these investments and our increased R&D to drive incremental organic sales growth. And our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as a nontraditional 6th Prime.
I would like to highlight the progress we made in Q1 towards our key priorities. Integration of the company is our most important priority this year. We are making progress towards upgrading our technology platforms, which will provide better visibility into the business, enable information sharing and collaboration and extract deficiencies. 
We recently won the prestigious 2018 Innovation Award from SAP for our cloud-based enterprise data platform, one of the many leap-ahead technology initiatives that will drive better business performance.
We continue to sectorize business units and divisions to drive greater integration across the enterprise. The goal is not just to reduce costs, but to innovate faster, become more efficient and better serve our customers in a coordinated and collaborative way. Our shared services platform also continues to expand. 
As we highlighted during the Investor Day, we are progressing with indirect procurement, IT service tests and ERP systems into the platform this year. In addition, through various L365 activities, our commitment to continuous improvement is being advanced throughout the enterprise and across every functional area. 
Now turning to our workforce initiatives. We've had a busy quarter. We are implementing an action plan to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent in the business. We have many phased initiatives to drive increased employee collaboration, and to better align employee activities with customer priorities. We changed our incentive compensation plan to add organic sales growth as a metric for the first time and created a mixed bonus pool to incentivize collaboration. 
As a reminder, last December, we made the decision to freeze our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2019. We estimate this action will reduce pension expense by at least $25 million beginning next year.
We continue to add great new people to our team. As you may have seen from our recent press release, Melanie Heitkamp will be heading off our HR Department as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer. Melanie's more than 20 years of industry and consulting experience will contribute greatly to our L3 3.0 initiatives. 
Also, John Kim just joined us as Vice President of Investor Relations and Analytics, and he will be working closely with Ralph and Heidi. 
On the top of good customer relationships, my team and I have been on the road extensively, actively listening to our Defense, Homeland Security and commercial aviation customers. We have been introducing them to the new L3, explaining our strategy and offering solutions to their needs and challenges. 
In the U.S., we have been spending time with key members of Congress, OSD, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. And internationally, we visited customers in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turning to our performance for the quarter. We exceeded our guidance and were pleased to report a strong 1.1x book-to-bill ratio, with all 4 segments above 1.0. We recently won the Royal Australian Navy's SEA 1180 program, where we will supply an integrated solution from the Communications, Electronics and Sensor segments. This is an example of improved collaboration and strategic positioning in the international arena. 
Other growth areas, such as our Security & Detection Systems and classified programs, had strong order bookings in the quarter. We also showed positive momentum in our commercial aviation business as we were awarded more flight simulator orders in this quarter than all of 2017, demonstrating our competitiveness in the growing pilot training market.
Two of our segments, Electronic Systems and Sensor Systems, demonstrated solid sales growth of 6% and 16%, respectively. The focused R&D investments are beginning to contribute to our sales growth. The new leadership team installed at these segments last year are executing well. The growth at Electronic Systems and Sensors is broad-based, and we expect growth to remain strong the rest of the year. 
I was, however, disappointed with the results in our Communication Systems for the quarter. I expect the leadership team under the new President, Andy Ivers, to make progress as the year unfolds. 
Turning to Aerospace Systems. Their financial performance was consistent with expectations. Our free cash flow is negative $85 million in Q1, in line with our internal plan and normal seasonality. We expect full year free cash flow to be consistent with prior guidance of $900 million and in line with our goal of approximately 120% free cash flow conversion.
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, M&A continues to be a priority. Last year, we invested over $300 million in acquisitions. Today's pipeline remains robust, and I expect our acquisition investments to be higher this year. 
Equipped divestiture update. As you saw this morning, we announced the deal to sell Vertex and some smaller aerospace units for $540 million cash. This transaction is expected to close sometime this summer. We will record a gain from this transaction with after-tax proceeds of approximately $400 million, which we will put to use based on our strategic priorities.
In closing, this quarter was the first step towards creating the new L3 3.0. There's a lot of work to do as we strive to make L3 an agile, leaner and more innovative and customer-centric company. I want to thank the entire L3 team for their commitment and dedication to this transformation and to the success of L3 and our customers. 
Now let me turn it over to Ralph, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook."
93538,558603562,1444516,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, plus lower income taxes,",1157,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, plus lower income taxes, which drove higher earnings per share.
First quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% to $2.34. Lower taxes were the largest component of EPS growth versus the 2017 first quarter, adding $0.27 to EPS. This occurred because of U.S. tax reform as well as increased stock option exercise related to retiring executives. 
You may recall that most of our tax deductions for stock-based compensation occur in the first quarter of each year due to our equity award vesting dates. 
Additionally, the higher first quarter stock option exercises is a nonrecurring item for the first half of 2018.
First quarter sales increased 2% to $2,370,000,000. Sales growth was strong at Sensors and Electronics with each increasing 16% and 6%, respectively. Within Electronics, sales also grew 14% in Security & Detection Systems. At Aerospace, sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our full year estimate. 
At Communications Systems, sales were lower than we expected, decreasing 8%, primarily due to lower production volume on UAV contracts. Also in Communication Systems, consistent with our outlook, commercial SATCOM sales declined modestly because of the continued soft market demand for new satellites.
First quarter operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.6% and operating income increased 6%. Segment margins are tracking to our full year estimates. 
Communication Systems margin lagged in the first quarter at 7.5%, primarily because of lower sales and $5 million of restructuring expenses, which together lowered margin in the first quarter by about 270 basis points.
We expect Communication Systems margin to increase rest of this year due to increasing sales, particularly in the second half of 2018, which will carry higher incremental margins, plus declining restructuring expenses and cost savings beginning to be realized from our restructuring actions. 
Sensor Systems margins declined to 12%, primarily due to higher R&D expenses. And as Chris explained, those are for our planned incremental growth investments this year.
Free cash flow was a negative $85 million for the first quarter due to seasonal increases in receivables and inventories that will reverse later this year. We also made deposits for aircraft purchases on new ISR recap programs for which we will be paid later this year. And we're also increasing capital expenditures this year versus 2017 to support growth in our simulation and training businesses. And that increase in CapEx is pronounced more in the -- earlier in the year.
First quarter funded orders grew 10% to $2.6 billion. And as Chris noted, the book-to-bill was 1.11x, which supports the accelerating quarterly sales growth that we expect this year. 
Now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased EPS by $0.10 to $9.50 at the midpoint, primarily for lower taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, we expect EPS to grow 12% for 2018 compared to 2017. 
We maintained our sales and operating margin guidance ranges. We expect consolidated sales of about $10 billion at the midpoint, with 4% growth over 2017. 
At the segment level, sales are trending above the guided midpoints for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors. 
Aerospace guidance also contemplates the divestiture of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which were sold with Vertex. Conversely, for Communications, sales are presently trending to the low end of guidance due to slower U.S. military awards and orders on next-generation C3 systems, protected communications and tactical communication terminals, which is pushing some sales to next year. 
Additionally, this year, our broadband communication sector is beginning new work on several next-generation LPI, LPD and MultiLink secured communications, which are high in engineering and development content, and initially have lower volumes before they transition to production in the future.
We also expect to book new production orders in the second half of 2018, including for UAV communications, that will generate sales in 2019.
On the operating margins, we continue to expect consolidated margin of 11.2% for 2018, which will increase 40 basis points compared to 2017 with operating income growth of 8%. Our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints remain at 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11% for Communications and 11.8% for Sensors.
I also want to provide a quick update on our business integration and restructuring. As you know, this is a focus area for Chris, me and our segment presidents and CFOs. We still expect to incur about $30 million of restructuring and services expenses this year, with an offsetting $15 million of cost savings from our restructuring actions. 
Additionally, depending on the outcome of new business pursuits in Aerospace, we will need to take additional action there later in the year, and our current guidance margin covers this potential additional restructuring. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered our tax estimate to 19%. That is a 19% tax rate factoring in the lower first quarter taxes. And we continue to expect free cash flow of $900 million for 2018. Our guidance now includes $10 million more of operating cash flow offset by $10 million more of capital expenditures. 
Regarding capital allocation. After paying our dividends and repurchasing stock to offset growth and shares outstanding, we continue to favor acquisitions. We repurchased $119 million of stock in the first quarter, and we plan to repurchase $300 million for 2018. We have a strong balance sheet with ample resources to make acquisitions. And recently, both Fitch and S&P affirmed their BBB- credit ratings and stable outlooks for L3. 
Additionally, our guidance update does not include benefits from deploying the proceeds from the sale of the Vertex businesses, which we announced today. And as Chris explained, we expect net cash proceeds of about $400 million. 
Looking at the 2018 second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion, which calculates sales growth of 4%, operating margin of 11% and diluted earnings per share between $2.35 and $2.45. 
Regarding our second quarter margin, it will be lower than what we reported in the 2017 second quarter, because it included -- we had a property sale gain in last year's second quarter of $42 million, which increased consolidated operating margin by 180 basis points. Excluding that 2017 property gain, we expect 2018 second quarter margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, our first quarter was a good start to the year. We grew orders, sales, operating income and earnings per share. We also increased margin by 40 basis points while investing more in R&D. We remained focused on improving our operational and financial performance. For the full year 2018, we expect to grow orders, sales, all the profit metrics and cash flow. We are also strategically allocating capital and have ample liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

I was just curious as to what's new that allowed you to maintain your guide despite some disappointing results there."

One, it's based upon our orders that we had in the first quarter and the order flow that we expect the balance of the year, which we expect to increase. And with respect to the margins, I talked about how the increasing sales, and most of the increase in sales is going to happen in the second half of the year. We're probably going to be down again on the top line in the second quarter. But within Communication Systems, our incremental gross margins are about 26%. So if the volume increases, we have a lot of flow-through, if you will, to operating income."

We've been investing for over a decade in some pretty unique solutions. I think we have some of the top talent in the nation, especially in Salt Lake City, working on these communication challenges. And I think there is a customer awareness that this is one of the biggest challenges facing the country, and it's not unusual for the communications to lag the platform procurement. But I think it's pretty well-known and documented that fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft can't communicate in a covert way. And if you look at our national defense strategy and some of the challenges that have been laid out, this is clearly an area that's going to get attention. So it's a long year. We've got one quarter behind us. As I said, it wasn't as good as I would've liked. But I think with new leadership and our technologies, and some of the development work that we won early in the year, we're well positioned for the long term. And it's the -- every time I'm in the Pentagon, the discussion on multidomain command and control is on the top of everybody's mind. And I think we're uniquely positioned to help in that challenge."

Throughout the rest of Aerospace, we had a pretty good quarter, a lot of classified additions. There's some additional aircraft that will be coming through the budget process, either major modifications to existing aircraft or some new aircraft. So I think we're looking pretty good there. On the international trips, there's a lot of interest, especially in the Mideast for our ISR platforms. So if you see some of the national defense strategy, there's a lot of talk about ISR and the need for that capability. And of course, that's in our sweet spot. And the Canadian F-18 that we've talked about for a year or so exercised their second option, and we also got E-6B work down in Aero. So seems like things have stabilized and started to position us for longer-term growth in Aero. And then on the other segments, Electronics and Sensors, we talked a little bit about. But Electronics, very, very good quarter on orders with Security & Detection, having growth as we have been successful with various airports around the world. A lot in the classified arena that we have in precision engagement systems and even with the Navy on our Power & Propulsion solutions. In Sensors, we have a couple that are getting close to being announced during the second quarter, but again, they had a great quarter, 16% top line growth. A lot of interest in our airborne turret systems, our infrared detection systems and our electronic warfare countermeasures. So the R&D that we're spending in those areas are starting to pay off and couldn't be happier with 1.1x book-to-bill ratio to start the year and bodes well for the rest of the year and 2019."

No, you're right on the contract structure we tend to have more fixed-price work than maybe the other companies. So there's really 2 opportunities. The #1 way to improve margins, in my opinion, has always been to increase the denominator and to grow. And I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability. And that's why we've rolled out our disciplined growth strategy. And myself and my team and others have been aggressively out there meeting with customers, both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end users to try to jump-start the growth. So the volume will improve the profitability. And then, of course, as we continue to reduce costs, I mean, this year, we're investing, and that's a lot in our IT systems, I mentioned the SAP award, which we're quite out of. We'll start to see those pay off in '19 and beyond. So it's kind of the old-fashioned cost reduction and more top line sales will improve that profitability. And the team is focused on that, and we're making progress. Unfortunately, we had -- have a rift in Salt Lake City, eliminated up to 140 positions, which again is part of our Comm segment. So we'll continue to do that where the business makes sense and as we continue to consolidate our divisions and our sectors. 
On the second question, I think we've been consistent in saying that we can easily make $1 billion of acquisitions a year and still protect our investment-grade credit rating. So whether it's a $1 billion or 2 $0.5 billion or 10 $100 million, we're looking at everything. We continue to look at it strategically, and I think we're doing a pretty good job aligning our portfolio with the defense strategy. I give Secretary of Defense, Mattis, credit. I think it was the first time the DoD has -- had a strategic review in 20 years, at least that's what he's been quoted as saying. So we all see where he's going and what capabilities he needs.

And if you look at the margins in our segments that we have presently, we're almost at 14% in Electronic Systems. We're about 12% in Sensor Systems, and that's after spending about $30 million more this year on R&D for incremental growth. We said that that's not going to be a recurring incremental spend. So if you factor that in or factor that away, if you will, the underlying normal margin in Sensor Systems is also approaching 14%. So the -- we have the most work to do in the other 2 segments with respect to the margins, and it's obvious. We're focused on it. And then across the entire company, Chris talked about our various initiatives, including the L365 Continuous Improvement, the consolidation and integration that we're doing across the sectors in terms of not only ERP platforms but also various support and administrative functions. And those initiatives are going to continue to provide operating income that we'll use for a combination of margin expansion and for reinvestment into the business in R&D and business development and marketing and selling.

Jon, I think this is a great question, and I think I try to be consistent on this, and I think it's important to clarify, and I fully appreciate the importance of margins, and we're working hard in that regard. But first and foremost, we are a growth company. We're trying to grow the top line. We're trying to grow the bottom line. We going to have $1.1 billion of EBIT this year. My goal is to get $1.2 billion in 2019 and continue to grow and get more earnings. I think we all know generally in this industry and especially at L3, the earnings does impact and burden the free cash flow. I think as I've looked back, we've averaged 120% free cash flow conversion rate, one of the better rates in the industry or the industrials. So ultimately, we're a compounder of free cash flow, and that's consistent with our strategy. We're going to make acquisitions. Some of these will be early-stage companies. Some of these will have amortization of intangibles, which will artificially lower the margins maybe in the near term. R&D, we've been very aggressive in R&D. It's no coincidence. Sensors grew 16%, and it's just 1 quarter, but they could be -- that -- have a great year. And I think it was the third quarter of last year that I have said, we're increasing in R&D, and we're starting to see it pay off. We made investments in Security & Detection and the equipment, allowing people to carry on liquids and laptops. And now we're starting to see orders there. We've made investments in our simulator business, and we're really on a roll in that regard. So the focus -- everything we decide, it's a balanced approach. But as I've said before, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company long term. I have no problem taking onetime charges for severance, for restructuring, investing in R&D or making acquisitions that may dilute the margins in the short term but positions us for the long term. But notwithstanding that, we're committed to the 12% target in 12, and we'll keep going with more volume and some of the transformational investments we're making on our internal systems will accelerate that. So that's how we're looking at it. That's how we're running the business, and that's how we're going to continue to succeed."

Internationally, like I said, there was some great interest, especially in the Mideast, with our capabilities. And as some of these countries have conflicts and aren't using the U.S. platforms, they see the importance and the need to have these world-class ISR capabilities.

A few months ago, I shared with you our vision of transforming L3 to become a best-in-class technology leader in the aerospace and defense industry. This is a multiyear journey that requires us to invest in our core capabilities, revitalize our culture and establish a deeper strategic relationship with our key customers. I have no doubt L3 will emerge a stronger company with higher sales growth, improved margins and increased cash flow. 
We are in year one of our transformation, and in any transformation it's normal to have some bumps along the way, but I am singularly focused on having everyone at L3 executing towards our long-term vision. 
We recently completed our first employee survey with a greater than 80% response rate, more than double the industry average. This illustrates the growing enthusiasm and engagement across the company for our new direction. Employees are energized, and every day, I see our people gaining confidence and striving to achieve more.
Let me review our 3-stage path that I highlighted in our Investor Day in December. 2018 is a transition and investment year where we focused on integration by laying the groundwork and building our infrastructure. We're optimizing our processes, our technologies and our talent to position us for future growth. In 2019, we expect these investments and our increased R&D to drive incremental organic sales growth. And our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as a nontraditional 6th Prime.
I would like to highlight the progress we made in Q1 towards our key priorities. Integration of the company is our most important priority this year. We are making progress towards upgrading our technology platforms, which will provide better visibility into the business, enable information sharing and collaboration and extract deficiencies. 
We recently won the prestigious 2018 Innovation Award from SAP for our cloud-based enterprise data platform, one of the many leap-ahead technology initiatives that will drive better business performance.
We continue to sectorize business units and divisions to drive greater integration across the enterprise. The goal is not just to reduce costs, but to innovate faster, become more efficient and better serve our customers in a coordinated and collaborative way. Our shared services platform also continues to expand. 
As we highlighted during the Investor Day, we are progressing with indirect procurement, IT service tests and ERP systems into the platform this year. In addition, through various L365 activities, our commitment to continuous improvement is being advanced throughout the enterprise and across every functional area. 
Now turning to our workforce initiatives. We've had a busy quarter. We are implementing an action plan to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent in the business. We have many phased initiatives to drive increased employee collaboration, and to better align employee activities with customer priorities. We changed our incentive compensation plan to add organic sales growth as a metric for the first time and created a mixed bonus pool to incentivize collaboration. 
As a reminder, last December, we made the decision to freeze our salary pension plans effective January 1, 2019. We estimate this action will reduce pension expense by at least $25 million beginning next year.
We continue to add great new people to our team. As you may have seen from our recent press release, Melanie Heitkamp will be heading off our HR Department as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer. Melanie's more than 20 years of industry and consulting experience will contribute greatly to our L3 3.0 initiatives. 
Also, John Kim just joined us as Vice President of Investor Relations and Analytics, and he will be working closely with Ralph and Heidi. 
On the top of good customer relationships, my team and I have been on the road extensively, actively listening to our Defense, Homeland Security and commercial aviation customers. We have been introducing them to the new L3, explaining our strategy and offering solutions to their needs and challenges. 
In the U.S., we have been spending time with key members of Congress, OSD, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. And internationally, we visited customers in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turning to our performance for the quarter. We exceeded our guidance and were pleased to report a strong 1.1x book-to-bill ratio, with all 4 segments above 1.0. We recently won the Royal Australian Navy's SEA 1180 program, where we will supply an integrated solution from the Communications, Electronics and Sensor segments. This is an example of improved collaboration and strategic positioning in the international arena. 
Other growth areas, such as our Security & Detection Systems and classified programs, had strong order bookings in the quarter. We also showed positive momentum in our commercial aviation business as we were awarded more flight simulator orders in this quarter than all of 2017, demonstrating our competitiveness in the growing pilot training market.
Two of our segments, Electronic Systems and Sensor Systems, demonstrated solid sales growth of 6% and 16%, respectively. The focused R&D investments are beginning to contribute to our sales growth. The new leadership team installed at these segments last year are executing well. The growth at Electronic Systems and Sensors is broad-based, and we expect growth to remain strong the rest of the year. 
I was, however, disappointed with the results in our Communication Systems for the quarter. I expect the leadership team under the new President, Andy Ivers, to make progress as the year unfolds. 
Turning to Aerospace Systems. Their financial performance was consistent with expectations. Our free cash flow is negative $85 million in Q1, in line with our internal plan and normal seasonality. We expect full year free cash flow to be consistent with prior guidance of $900 million and in line with our goal of approximately 120% free cash flow conversion.
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, M&A continues to be a priority. Last year, we invested over $300 million in acquisitions. Today's pipeline remains robust, and I expect our acquisition investments to be higher this year. 
Equipped divestiture update. As you saw this morning, we announced the deal to sell Vertex and some smaller aerospace units for $540 million cash. This transaction is expected to close sometime this summer. We will record a gain from this transaction with after-tax proceeds of approximately $400 million, which we will put to use based on our strategic priorities.
In closing, this quarter was the first step towards creating the new L3 3.0. There's a lot of work to do as we strive to make L3 an agile, leaner and more innovative and customer-centric company. I want to thank the entire L3 team for their commitment and dedication to this transformation and to the success of L3 and our customers. 
Now let me turn it over to Ralph, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook."
93538,558603562,1446411,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, plus lower income taxes,",1157,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the first quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the first quarter, our operating results were ahead of our outlook with strong orders, higher sales and operating margin, plus lower income taxes, which drove higher earnings per share.
First quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% to $2.34. Lower taxes were the largest component of EPS growth versus the 2017 first quarter, adding $0.27 to EPS. This occurred because of U.S. tax reform as well as increased stock option exercise related to retiring executives. 
You may recall that most of our tax deductions for stock-based compensation occur in the first quarter of each year due to our equity award vesting dates. 
Additionally, the higher first quarter stock option exercises is a nonrecurring item for the first half of 2018.
First quarter sales increased 2% to $2,370,000,000. Sales growth was strong at Sensors and Electronics with each increasing 16% and 6%, respectively. Within Electronics, sales also grew 14% in Security & Detection Systems. At Aerospace, sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our full year estimate. 
At Communications Systems, sales were lower than we expected, decreasing 8%, primarily due to lower production volume on UAV contracts. Also in Communication Systems, consistent with our outlook, commercial SATCOM sales declined modestly because of the continued soft market demand for new satellites.
First quarter operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.6% and operating income increased 6%. Segment margins are tracking to our full year estimates. 
Communication Systems margin lagged in the first quarter at 7.5%, primarily because of lower sales and $5 million of restructuring expenses, which together lowered margin in the first quarter by about 270 basis points.
We expect Communication Systems margin to increase rest of this year due to increasing sales, particularly in the second half of 2018, which will carry higher incremental margins, plus declining restructuring expenses and cost savings beginning to be realized from our restructuring actions. 
Sensor Systems margins declined to 12%, primarily due to higher R&D expenses. And as Chris explained, those are for our planned incremental growth investments this year.
Free cash flow was a negative $85 million for the first quarter due to seasonal increases in receivables and inventories that will reverse later this year. We also made deposits for aircraft purchases on new ISR recap programs for which we will be paid later this year. And we're also increasing capital expenditures this year versus 2017 to support growth in our simulation and training businesses. And that increase in CapEx is pronounced more in the -- earlier in the year.
First quarter funded orders grew 10% to $2.6 billion. And as Chris noted, the book-to-bill was 1.11x, which supports the accelerating quarterly sales growth that we expect this year. 
Now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased EPS by $0.10 to $9.50 at the midpoint, primarily for lower taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, we expect EPS to grow 12% for 2018 compared to 2017. 
We maintained our sales and operating margin guidance ranges. We expect consolidated sales of about $10 billion at the midpoint, with 4% growth over 2017. 
At the segment level, sales are trending above the guided midpoints for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors. 
Aerospace guidance also contemplates the divestiture of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which were sold with Vertex. Conversely, for Communications, sales are presently trending to the low end of guidance due to slower U.S. military awards and orders on next-generation C3 systems, protected communications and tactical communication terminals, which is pushing some sales to next year. 
Additionally, this year, our broadband communication sector is beginning new work on several next-generation LPI, LPD and MultiLink secured communications, which are high in engineering and development content, and initially have lower volumes before they transition to production in the future.
We also expect to book new production orders in the second half of 2018, including for UAV communications, that will generate sales in 2019.
On the operating margins, we continue to expect consolidated margin of 11.2% for 2018, which will increase 40 basis points compared to 2017 with operating income growth of 8%. Our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints remain at 13.7% for Electronics, 7.9% for Aerospace, 11% for Communications and 11.8% for Sensors.
I also want to provide a quick update on our business integration and restructuring. As you know, this is a focus area for Chris, me and our segment presidents and CFOs. We still expect to incur about $30 million of restructuring and services expenses this year, with an offsetting $15 million of cost savings from our restructuring actions. 
Additionally, depending on the outcome of new business pursuits in Aerospace, we will need to take additional action there later in the year, and our current guidance margin covers this potential additional restructuring. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered our tax estimate to 19%. That is a 19% tax rate factoring in the lower first quarter taxes. And we continue to expect free cash flow of $900 million for 2018. Our guidance now includes $10 million more of operating cash flow offset by $10 million more of capital expenditures. 
Regarding capital allocation. After paying our dividends and repurchasing stock to offset growth and shares outstanding, we continue to favor acquisitions. We repurchased $119 million of stock in the first quarter, and we plan to repurchase $300 million for 2018. We have a strong balance sheet with ample resources to make acquisitions. And recently, both Fitch and S&P affirmed their BBB- credit ratings and stable outlooks for L3. 
Additionally, our guidance update does not include benefits from deploying the proceeds from the sale of the Vertex businesses, which we announced today. And as Chris explained, we expect net cash proceeds of about $400 million. 
Looking at the 2018 second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion, which calculates sales growth of 4%, operating margin of 11% and diluted earnings per share between $2.35 and $2.45. 
Regarding our second quarter margin, it will be lower than what we reported in the 2017 second quarter, because it included -- we had a property sale gain in last year's second quarter of $42 million, which increased consolidated operating margin by 180 basis points. Excluding that 2017 property gain, we expect 2018 second quarter margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, our first quarter was a good start to the year. We grew orders, sales, operating income and earnings per share. We also increased margin by 40 basis points while investing more in R&D. We remained focused on improving our operational and financial performance. For the full year 2018, we expect to grow orders, sales, all the profit metrics and cash flow. We are also strategically allocating capital and have ample liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

We've been investing for over a decade in some pretty unique solutions. I think we have some of the top talent in the nation, especially in Salt Lake City, working on these communication challenges.

But I think it's pretty well-known and documented that fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft can't communicate in a covert way. And if you look at our national defense strategy and some of the challenges that have been laid out, this is clearly an area that's going to get attention. So it's a long year. We've got one quarter behind us. As I said, it wasn't as good as I would've liked. But I think with new leadership and our technologies, and some of the development work that we won early in the year, we're well positioned for the long term. And it's the -- every time I'm in the Pentagon, the discussion on multidomain command and control is on the top of everybody's mind. And I think we're uniquely positioned to help in that challenge."

Throughout the rest of Aerospace, we had a pretty good quarter, a lot of classified additions. There's some additional aircraft that will be coming through the budget process, either major modifications to existing aircraft or some new aircraft. So I think we're looking pretty good there. On the international trips, there's a lot of interest, especially in the Mideast for our ISR platforms. So if you see some of the national defense strategy, there's a lot of talk about ISR and the need for that capability. And of course, that's in our sweet spot. And the Canadian F-18 that we've talked about for a year or so exercised their second option, and we also got E-6B work down in Aero. So seems like things have stabilized and started to position us for longer-term growth in Aero. And then on the other segments, Electronics and Sensors, we talked a little bit about. But Electronics, very, very good quarter on orders with Security & Detection, having growth as we have been successful with various airports around the world. A lot in the classified arena that we have in precision engagement systems and even with the Navy on our Power & Propulsion solutions. In Sensors, we have a couple that are getting close to being announced during the second quarter, but again, they had a great quarter, 16% top line growth. A lot of interest in our airborne turret systems, our infrared detection systems and our electronic warfare countermeasures. So the R&D that we're spending in those areas are starting to pay off and couldn't be happier with 1.1x book-to-bill ratio to start the year and bodes well for the rest of the year and 2019."

And obviously, you're working on the margins, and you talked about that a little bit earlier. But how do you -- given that opportunity, you're really built for much higher margins. So I wanted to see if you go in to -- perhaps give us a little more color on how you're going to get there. And then the second question is on transformational M&A. Should we be looking for you to do something more significant at some point? It seems to me that you're leaning more in the direction of the Navy. Could something happen there?"

No, you're right on the contract structure we tend to have more fixed-price work than maybe the other companies. So there's really 2 opportunities. The #1 way to improve margins, in my opinion, has always been to increase the denominator and to grow. And I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability. And that's why we've rolled out our disciplined growth strategy. And myself and my team and others have been aggressively out there meeting with customers, both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end users to try to jump-start the growth. So the volume will improve the profitability. And then, of course, as we continue to reduce costs, I mean, this year, we're investing, and that's a lot in our IT systems, I mentioned the SAP award, which we're quite out of. We'll start to see those pay off in '19 and beyond. So it's kind of the old-fashioned cost reduction and more top line sales will improve that profitability. And the team is focused on that, and we're making progress. Unfortunately, we had -- have a rift in Salt Lake City, eliminated up to 140 positions, which again is part of our Comm segment. So we'll continue to do that where the business makes sense and as we continue to consolidate our divisions and our sectors. 
On the second question, I think we've been consistent in saying that we can easily make $1 billion of acquisitions a year and still protect our investment-grade credit rating. So whether it's a $1 billion or 2 $0.5 billion or 10 $100 million, we're looking at everything. We continue to look at it strategically, and I think we're doing a pretty good job aligning our portfolio with the defense strategy. I give Secretary of Defense, Mattis, credit. I think it was the first time the DoD has -- had a strategic review in 20 years, at least that's what he's been quoted as saying. So we all see where he's going and what capabilities he needs. And we'll be happy to do larger acquisitions if they make sense strategically and operationally and financially. And..."

Jon, I think this is a great question, and I think I try to be consistent on this, and I think it's important to clarify, and I fully appreciate the importance of margins, and we're working hard in that regard. But first and foremost, we are a growth company. We're trying to grow the top line. We're trying to grow the bottom line. We going to have $1.1 billion of EBIT this year. My goal is to get $1.2 billion in 2019 and continue to grow and get more earnings. I think we all know generally in this industry and especially at L3, the earnings does impact and burden the free cash flow. I think as I've looked back, we've averaged 120% free cash flow conversion rate, one of the better rates in the industry or the industrials. So ultimately, we're a compounder of free cash flow, and that's consistent with our strategy. We're going to make acquisitions. Some of these will be early-stage companies. Some of these will have amortization of intangibles, which will artificially lower the margins maybe in the near term. R&D, we've been very aggressive in R&D. It's no coincidence. Sensors grew 16%, and it's just 1 quarter, but they could be -- that -- have a great year. And I think it was the third quarter of last year that I have said, we're increasing in R&D, and we're starting to see it pay off. We made investments in Security & Detection and the equipment, allowing people to carry on liquids and laptops. And now we're starting to see orders there. We've made investments in our simulator business, and we're really on a roll in that regard. So the focus -- everything we decide, it's a balanced approach. But as I've said before, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company long term. I have no problem taking onetime charges for severance, for restructuring, investing in R&D or making acquisitions that may dilute the margins in the short term but positions us for the long term. But notwithstanding that, we're committed to the 12% target in 12, and we'll keep going with more volume and some of the transformational investments we're making on our internal systems will accelerate that. So that's how we're looking at it. That's how we're running the business, and that's how we're going to continue to succeed."

Those 2 businesses, particularly on the commercial side, tend to be more capital-intensive, and we're growing very rapidly there. And we recently were awarded some new business. It's close to being -- turning into a funded order that is going to require us to make more investments in flight simulators that we'll use to sell Power by the Hour type services to our customers. The good news is we actually manufacture those flight simulators ourselves, so that gives us a cost advantage, if you will. And beyond 2018, we don't expect that the CapEx is going to increase in terms of dollars from what we're investing in 2018. But there'll probably be different focused areas next year depending on where we see the incremental emerging growth opportunities. And it's possible that CapEx can also decline slightly next year to where it's been the last several years before 2018."

We're platform agnostic, so we work on business jets, we work on really just about any platform. Fixed wing, we're looking at rotary wing, we're looking at other services beyond the Air Force. Internationally, like I said, there was some great interest, especially in the Mideast, with our capabilities. And as some of these countries have conflicts and aren't using the U.S. platforms, they see the importance and the need to have these world-class ISR capabilities. So I think that's going to be the strategies for the most part. I don't see a lot of head of state, VIP type work in our future.

So we have a couple of those that we're in discussions with that could require some upfront capital. And Security & Detection, we're always looking there. We have a new leader starting this past January. And with the Implant acquisition, the Mac H acquisition, we filled in some gaps.

Everything else was focused more on the need for consistent tools, more integration, a refresh on talent and how to move amongst the company to just to continue your career. So probably couldn't have asked for better results from the employee survey, but we still got to go ahead and develop an action plan. And with Melanie joining us, we're going to lay that out and move forward. I guess I like to go generally pretty fast in everything I do. And I get the sense that the team wants to even go faster than me, which is exciting. We keep bringing in new people, and they just see the opportunity and the excitement. And you know some of the external hires we've had and there's lots of options, but people want to jump on the L3 bandwagon because what we're doing is unique and different and makes a difference. So it's just a general comment, we're doing a lot in the IT world. And I don't want to overplay, but to get that SAP award, I was quite proud of. And again, we like to be a leader. We're the first defense contractor to be on Office 365, which is a secured government cloud. So no other contractor has done that. We're going to save money. We have better capabilities.

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. 
As you saw this morning, we reported solid quarterly results. Consistent with our integration and growth [indiscernible], we delivered 8% year-over-year growth in both operating income and sales. Second quarter organic growth of 7% is the highest rate we've achieved in about a decade and speaks to both the improving execution on our growth initiative in addition to being well positioned in growing markets, including defense, security and commercial pilot training. 
Our book-to-bill was 1.1, which includes only $15 million of the initial funding for the $391 million [indiscernible] night vision goggles program. Funded orders were up [ 32% ] in the quarter led by strength in Aerospace. And based on our year-to-date performance and a continued positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our guidance for sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. 
I return last week from the [indiscernible] Airshow with my team where we had our most productive show ever. We had 1,000 guests to our [indiscernible] pavilion conducted over 200 meetings with customers, and global government leaders. We showcased our technology as a nontraditional [indiscernible] prime and also announced the recent hire of [ Steve O'Brien ], our new Senior Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. I've been focusing on strengthening our leadership talent, and Steve is the latest addition who is an experienced and respected industry leader. 
At our Annual Meeting in May, 2 of our directors chose not to stand for reelection, and [indiscernible] was unanimously appointed to be our newest member of the board. [ Rita ] is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and spent her career in operations at 3 Fortune 100 companies, including Apple. Her high-tech and operations expertise is certain to help us, and she brings the refreshing and vital Silicon Valley perspective to our company. 
We kicked off of the year with a team of integration and collaboration and innovation, and I want to report back to you on the progress now that we're midway through the year. When I took over, I saw an important need for the enterprise to work more efficiently, be more collaborative and increase our effectiveness at helping our customer solve their most complex and pressing problems. 
We're making progress to get better integrated and are evaluating plans for realignment. First, along every functional area, we are developing plans on standardizing and streamlining processes, systems and policies. 
For example, in the area of IT, our CIO will have company-wide responsibility for integrating our IT system, and we will realize improved efficiencies, better security and lower costs. In HR, we're streamlining many legacy policies. And based on feedback from a company-wide employee survey, we're developing leadership and training programs to invigorate our workforce. 
As a high-tech growth company, our engineering workforce and their development are part of the lifeblood of this company, responsible for driving innovation that ultimately fuels our growth. 
If you will recall, I hired a new leader of engineering earlier this year, and he's been coordinating the effort to elevate and promote the role of engineering in building our advantage for the future. We're taking steps to connect our engineering community to enhance collaboration, standardization and upgrade in our engineering tools and capabilities as well as investing in training and professional development. 
We are continuing to sectorize our [ 70-plus ] division and consolidate select operating facilities to drive greater efficiency. The Electronic Systems segment is leading this effort with the goal of reducing its division by half. This is a multiyear effort, which we expect to complete by 2021. 
Consistent with our strategy of becoming a nontraditional [ sixth ] prime, we've been evaluating the alignment of our capabilities and core competencies across the reporting segments. In order to move up the food chain and deliver more integrated solution, we need to be better coordinated in developing technology and agile in addressing customer needs. Therefore, we're reviewing plans to consolidate from 3 -- from 4 segments to 3 segments. We'll be finalizing this plan in August, and we'll provide additional detail at that time. 
Change is never easy with a large company, and there are many steps in a sequence to coordinate the gearing, so the engine of the corporation runs better. Many customers are underserved relative to their needs for fast innovative low-cost solution, and we intend to fill that need as a nontraditional [ sixth ] prime. I'm encouraged by discussions with the Department of Defense and many international customers. 
Our teams are starting to think more creatively about harnessing the power of L3 Technologies to move up the value chain. This shift in how we go to market will take time, but I want you as shareholders to know what we're working towards as the company and what I'm expecting of my team. 
Let's now [indiscernible] to the quarter's results. In terms of sales, all segments grew sales in the quarter led by Sensor Systems, which was up 22%. Our renewed focus on driving growth and targeted business development activities are bearing fruit with first half book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Turning to our segment. Aerospace Systems had a good quarter, improving both financially and operationally. We converted several of our long-term pursuits in the quarter, our aircraft recapitalization and fleet expansion. Moreover, we continue to pursue U.S. and international opportunities, and we expect the growth to continue into the second half of the year. 
Communication Systems continues to be a challenge. While we are seeing a pickup in military demand for traveling wave tube, the commercial satellite market continues to face headwind. However, the Communication's segment long-term growth prospects are bright with ongoing development work in Free Space Optics and electronic warfare that will yield production work in the years ahead. We won several initial awards in targeted areas such as classified space, Maritime C4ISR and electronic warfare that opened up opportunities for much larger awards. 
Electronic Systems continue to deliver solid results across a broad array of programs. On the commercial side, our Security & Detection Systems had a strong sales in order -- quarter driven by explosive trace detection and workflow solution. On the defense side, we booked strong orders from precision engagement and power and propulsion.
Sensor Systems was again our fastest growth segment. As planned, our operating margins were down year-over-year due to increased R&D investment. Order growth was particularly strong in WESCAM and Maritime. We're also investing in several next-generation technologies, such as directed energy and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles that will drive future growth for L3. 
One highlight for sensors was a 3-year $390 million next-generation night vision goggle award for 13,000 units, 10,000 for the Army and 3,000 for the Marines. Consistent with our customers' desire to move rapidly, the Army and L3 has been alpha contracting process to negotiate and complete the deal on about 60 days. This 10,000 unit initial orders positions us to compete for the Army's planned purchase of 100,000 night vision goggles in the years ahead. This is a case in point of bringing the disruptive and innovative technology fast to market at an affordable price. 
Turning to capital deployment. We acquired 2 small companies in June for [ $69 ] million and entered into an agreement to acquire 2 more companies in July for approximately $200 [ billion ]. Apply Defense Solution, which we acquired last month, is an important addition to our space portfolio. It is a business we know well, and we expected to have an immediate impact on our new business pursuits. 
The 2 related companies we announced in July are leaders in computer network operations and vulnerability research. We acquired these businesses that an attractive 9x estimated 2018 EBITDA multiple and 7x estimated 2019 EBITDA. This business enhances our capability and the convergence of electronic warfare and cybersecurity, enabling us to expand and enhance our [indiscernible] offering globally. 
In addition to acquisitions, we frontloaded our share repurchase for the year. We purchased [ $168 ] million worth of our stock in the second quarter, [indiscernible] $119 million in Q1 for first half total of $287 million. In addition, we repurchased $34 million in July for a year-to-date total of $321 million. 
In closing, we are moving fast and have accomplished a lot in the first 6 months of this year, and we're just getting started. Transforming L3 into a truly world-class company will require time, hard work and dedication from everyone at L3. Our employees and leadership have firmly embraced this challenge and change. 
I want to thank the entire L3 team for taking us on this journey. 
Now I will turn it over to Ralph to go over our financial performance and outlook."
93538,574355480,1509452,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted ear",866,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
Segment operating margin, excluding a property gain in the second quarter of last year, was unchanged at 10.6%. As Chris said, we also increased our R&D spending, and that was by [ $19 ] million quarter-over-quarter to fuel future growth, and that higher R&D lowered second quarter margin by 70 basis points.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.47, and it increased 20% excluding the $42 million property gain in the 2017 second quarter. Adjusted EPS excludes a debt retirement charges of $0.45 and a gain of $0.31 on the sale of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which we sold with Vertex. These 2 items were not contemplated in our prior year 2018 guidance. 
Second quarter sales increased 8% to $2.6 billion, with strong organic growth of 7.5%, driven by 10% growth in our U.S. Department of Defense business. Sales growth was strong at Sensors, Aerospace, Electronics, with each growing 22%, 9% and 6%, respectively. 
At Communications, sales were about flat. Second quarter operating margin was 10.6% and lower than the 11% we expected because Communication Systems margin lagged again at 8.1%. I'll explain this all to Communication Systems margin when I review the 2018 guidance update in a few moments. And I'll tell you that we -- despite those softer margins, we have maintained our 2018 consolidated margin guidance of 11.2%. 
Segment margins for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors were in line or better than our full year estimates. Sensor Systems margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% as expected primarily due to higher R&D spending, which we plan for, and that was $17 million. In fact, we accelerate R&D spending in the second quarter to take advantage of certain new business opportunities in that segment. Free cash flow was [ $165 ] million for the second quarter. 
And now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased adjusted EPS by $0.40 or 4% at the midpoint to $9.90 due to higher sales in operating income as well as lower interest expense and taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, EPS will grow 17% compared to last year.
We increased our sales guidance midpoint by $150 million to $10.1 billion, and we expect sales to grow 6% over 2017. 
We continue to expect total segment operating margin of 11.2% for 2018, and that will expand 40 basis points over 2017. And combined with our sales growth, we expect segment operating income to increase 10% year-over-year.
We revised our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints to [ 14% ] for Electronics, which is up 30 basis points, 12.5% for Sensors, up 70 basis points, 8% for Aerospace, which is up 10 basis points, and 10% for Communications, which is down 100 basis points. 
We reduced margin guidance for Communication Systems for 2 items. First, production orders for broadband communications have remained sluggish, closing us to lower [indiscernible] sales for 2018. Second, at the traveling wave [ tube ] businesses and spacing power sector, while we completed the consolidation of those businesses in April, their return to normal manufacturing productivity and yields happening at a slower pace than we planned. 
Below the operating income line with lower interest expense for the savings from our recent debt refinancing, and we also lowered the estimated tax rate. We increased estimated free cash flow for the year to [ $915 ] million. 
Regarding capital allocation, Chris covered the recent acquisitions and share repurchase activity. So I'll add that with respect to share repurchases, since our year-to-date July, repurchases are $321 million, which is above our previous plan of $300 million. We could repurchase up to $400 million for this year, depending on acquisition activity, and there are a few other deals that we're presently looking at. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of the Vertex businesses on June 29, and the final net proceeds after paying taxes on the gain of that sale should be about $430 million. 
Also, with respect to our recent debt refinancings, they'll reduce our annual interest expense by [ $15 ] million. We incurred [ $69 ] million of debt retirement charges totaling [ $0.66 ] per share. And since the debt retirements [indiscernible] June and July, $48 million of those charges were recorded at the second quarter, and the remaining $21 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Taking a quick look at our third quarter. We expect sales of at least $2.5 billion, operating margin of about 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.40, which excludes the third quarter debt retirement charge of $0.20.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had very solid orders, sales and EPS growth in the second quarter. We're investing more in R&D. We raised guidance for the full year. We are allocating capital to grow to increase shareholder value. And we have ample resources and liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

I think there's 7 or 8 that are somewhat we'll recognize. Our goal is to be #1 or 2 in every market that we mark it, and we're going to aggressively grow organically, make acquisitions, partner and team. And I think a lot of the airlines that we had discussions with maybe interested in just unloading their assets, their simulators and the responsibilities to a company like L3, and we may be in position to take those over.

I think a perfect example, this quarter with Sensors in particular but the corporation in total, we accelerated our R&D, and I think it was about $17 million in Sensors. Again, they grew 22%. And I'll say what I've said every quarter, I have absolutely no problem spending money in the near term, whether it's R&D, whether it's severance, whether it's restructuring, taking charges, spending the money for the long-term growth of this company and understanding the complications of doing that. I think we balanced it pretty well. And the more you grow, the more volume we have. And higher your margins get to resolve a lot of your fixed costs.

On the ground combat vehicles within our Electronics segment, we do have combat propulsion systems up in Michigan. They do a lot with the engines here in the U.S. and internationally, and that business has been growing. So I think we have a play there that we're working on. And of course, the sensors on various vehicles we're working with and looking for opportunities to have our sensors, including some of the WESCAM [indiscernible]. Historically, our airborne platforms, we've invested some R&D to have those, not only be maritime, but ground vehicle as well. So it's an opportunity we're looking at and seeing how we can get more out of the pie."

So with respect to top line, I explained, as we lowered the estimated sales by $100 million for the year, and that is in the broadband communication sector. On the last earnings conference call, where I talked about where sales were trending by segment, I did explain that we were trending to a low end of sales for Communication Systems segment. I also had explained that the pickup in sales that we were anticipating was contingent on booking certain orders later on in the year. So I said today that the production in order volume has remained sluggish. And as Chris explained, we are seeing some nice wins, which is mostly development work for next-gen communication type work. So the business in broadband communications is transitioning for a more development cost type work versus fixed price reduction work, and that definitely weighs on the operating margins. 
So with respect to the reduction in the Comm Systems margins of 100 basis points this year, I said that the main item or the first item was that lower sales volume. In broadband communication systems, that's probably 2/3 of the reduction in operating income and margin in that segment guidance, and that's a business that will be about 1.2 billion sales this year. So those sales have been declining about 8% year-over-year. The other anthem impacting the margins is the traveling wave tube or TWT businesses. And you recall that those are 2 businesses that we consolidate over the last year and a half plus. We completed the consolidation in April, and I said that we're not yet experiencing what we would consider to be normal manufacturing yields of productivity on those traveling wave tubes. We're going to get there beginning in the second half of this year, and we start to see some improvement in June. I'll also tell you that in terms of manufacturing complexity, Traveling-Wave Tubes is among the most complex type of manufacturing that we do [indiscernible] there's a lot of calibration and tuning activity. And those skill sets we had to rebuild with new employees and training those employees, so take us a little longer than we thought to get there on the operating margins."

I mean, we do monitor these acquisitions. A couple of weeks ago, we were looking at the [ 2016 ] acquisitions, and they are effectively a little over 9x EBITDA multiple this year relative to what we paid for in [ '16 ]. The '17",365,"Yes. Thanks for that, Jon. I mean, we do monitor these acquisitions. A couple of weeks ago, we were looking at the [ 2016 ] acquisitions, and they are effectively a little over 9x EBITDA multiple this year relative to what we paid for in [ '16 ]. The '17 itself is still too early to evaluate. We did get some good interesting acquisitions this quarter. And again, a lot of these are built on relationships. I think at least 3 to 4, we've known the companies and the owners for years, and we've worked with them, supported them. And at the right time, we enter these deals. So we try not to get into these auctions and bidding wars. I mean, obviously, we worked with the bankers on an as-needed basis, but a lot of these, as we talked about, want to be part of L3. We have success stories, they come in, they meet other entrepreneurs that we've acquired that are still with us. And it's that same theme that we talked about for years is that it's the balance of maintaining that entrepreneurial spirit with the scale of the major corporation, and that's our secret sauce. I think we're doing that well. Consolidation as a division is in no way impacts that. And we said we do easily -- we could do up to $1 billion a year and M&A and still keep our investment ratings, investment credit ratings. So there's no walking back from there, and there's really no limitation on the [indiscernible]. We take what's available. I said before, I'd rather do $500 million. But if they're not out there, we'll continue to do the [ $69 ] million ones, the $200 [ million ] ones and whatever's available. So we've got a great process, a good pipeline. And like I said, I think we'll announce another one probably within a month maybe in the $100 million range, and we've got a couple others we're looking at. And some will close and some won't. But clearly, accretive deals is our preference unless it's technology buy that accelerates our R&D effort for the long term. So I hope that helps, Jon."

But I like it. We'll work that into our branding and marketing. We are all sitting around in jeans and T-shirts today, so maybe we are making progress after all. We historically have 3% of revenue and R&D. I think we've taken up a notch. Again, we're doing a better job aligning with where our customers are spending their money. They've laid out a national security and a national defense strategy, which is helpful. And again, the situational awareness, whether it's on the ISR front and the movement to business jets where we invested and miniaturizing some of our capabilities. It's all about [indiscernible], speed to market, interconnectivity. The Comm segment, which we talked about a little bit, none of us are happy where we are, but one of the top priorities around the world is the connectivity. There's fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft, and like I said before, they need to be able to communicate data in a contested environment as well as document it that is lining, and we'll continue to invest in those capabilities. And I'm excited about the opportunity to get those requirements into the procurement process. So we are doing a couple of things differently. We have these innovations I think last time we're up to 35 so far this year where we have [indiscernible] and we put people together and try to solve a problem in a week. And we're getting more bang for the buck, spending less R&D by setting these targets and goals. And you can learn a lot in a week if you get 5, 7, 10 men and women in a room with a set problem, set budget and pretty exciting. So autonomy is big. Secured comm is big. What we've been doing in UUVs, UAVs, supporting small flat payloads, those types of things is where we're spending our money."

As you saw this morning, we reported solid quarterly results. Consistent with our integration and growth theme, we delivered 8% year-over-year growth in both operating income and sales. Second quarter organic growth of 7% is the highest rate we've achieved in about a decade and speaks to both the improving execution on our growth initiative in addition to being well positioned in growing markets, including defense, security and commercial pilot training. 
Our book-to-bill was 1.1, which includes only $15 million of the initial funding for the $391 million BNVBG night vision goggles program. Funded orders were up 32% in the quarter led by strength in Aerospace. And based on our year-to-date performance and a continued positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our guidance for sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. 
I returned last week from the Farnborough Airshow with my team where we had our most productive show ever. We had 1,000 guests to our chalet and pavilion conducted over 200 meetings with customers, partners and global government leaders. We showcased our technology as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime and also announced the recent hire of Steve O'Brien, our new Senior Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. I've been focusing on strengthening our leadership talent, and Steve is the latest addition who is an experienced and respected industry leader. 
At our Annual Meeting in May, 2 of our directors chose not to stand for reelection, and Rita Lane was unanimously appointed to be our newest member of the board. Rita is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and spent her career in operations at 3 Fortune 100 companies, including Apple. Her high-tech and operations expertise is certain to help us, and she brings a refreshing and vital Silicon Valley perspective to our company. 
We kicked off of the year with a theme of integration, collaboration and innovation, and I want to report back to you on the progress now that we're midway through the year. When I took over, I saw an important need for the enterprise to work more efficiently, be more collaborative and increase our effectiveness at helping our customers solve their most complex and pressing problems. 
We're making progress to get better integrated and are evaluating plans for realignment. First, along every functional area, we are developing plans on standardizing and streamlining processes, systems and policies. 
For example, in the area of IT, our CIO will have company-wide responsibility for integrating our IT systems, and we will realize improved efficiencies, better security and lower costs. In HR, we're streamlining many legacy policies. And based on feedback from a company-wide employee survey, we're developing leadership and training programs to invigorate our workforce. 
As a high-tech growth company, our engineering workforce and their development are part of the lifeblood of this company, responsible for driving innovation that ultimately fuels our growth. 
If you will recall, I hired a new leader of engineering earlier this year, and he's been coordinating the efforts to elevate and promote the role of engineering in building our advantage for the future. We're taking steps to connect our engineering community to enhance collaboration, standardization and upgrade in our engineering tools and capabilities as well as investing in training and professional development. 
We are continuing to sectorize our 70-plus divisions and consolidate select operating facilities to drive greater efficiency. The Electronic Systems segment is leading this effort with the goal of reducing its division by half. This is a multiyear effort, which we expect to complete by 2021. 
Consistent with our strategy of becoming a nontraditional [ fixed] prime, we've been evaluating the alignment of our capabilities and core competencies across the reporting segments. In order to move up the food chain and deliver more integrated solutions, we need to be better coordinated in developing technology and agile in addressing customer needs. Therefore, we're reviewing plans to consolidate from 3 -- from 4 segments to 3 segments. We'll be finalizing this plan in August, and we'll provide additional detail at that time. 
Change is never easy with a large company, and there are many steps in a sequence to coordinate the gearing, so the engine of the corporation runs better. Many customers are underserved relative to their needs for fast innovative low-cost solutions, and we intend to fill that need as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime. I'm encouraged by discussions with the Department of Defense and many international customers. 
Our teams are starting to think more creatively about harnessing the power of L3 Technologies to move up the value chain. This shift in how we go to market will take time, but I want you as shareholders to know what we're working towards as the company and what I'm expecting of my team. 
Let's now turn to the quarter's results. In terms of sales, all segments grew sales in the quarter led by Sensor Systems, which was up 22%. Our renewed focus on driving growth and targeted business development activities are bearing fruit with first half book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Turning to our segments. Aerospace Systems had a good quarter, improving both financially and operationally. We converted several of our long-term pursuits in the quarter, our aircraft recapitalization and fleet expansion. Moreover, we continue to pursue U.S. and international opportunities, and we expect the growth to continue into the second half of the year. 
Communication Systems continues to be a challenge. While we are seeing a pickup in military demand for traveling wave tubes, the commercial satellite market continues to face headwinds. However, the Communication's segment long-term growth prospects are bright with ongoing development work in Free Space Optics and electronic warfare that will yield production work in the years ahead. We won several initial awards in targeted areas such as classified space, Maritime C4ISR and electronic warfare that open up opportunities for much larger awards. 
Electronic Systems continues to deliver solid results across a broad array of programs. On the commercial side, our Security & Detection Systems had a strong sales in order -- quarter driven by explosive trace detection and workflow solutions. On the defense side, we booked strong orders from precision engagement and power and propulsion.
Sensor Systems was again our fastest growth segment. As planned, our operating margins were down year-over-year due to increased R&D investment. Order growth was particularly strong in WESCAM and Maritime. We're also investing in several next-generation technologies, such as directed energy and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles that will drive future growth for L3. 
One highlight for sensors was a 3-year $390 million next-generation night vision goggle award for 13,000 units; 10,000 for the Army and 3,000 for the Marines. Consistent with our customers' desire to move rapidly, the Army and L3 has been alpha contracting processed to negotiate and complete the deal in about 60 days. This 10,000 unit initial orders positions us to compete for the Army's planned purchase of 100,000 night vision goggles in the years ahead. This is a case in point of bringing a disruptive and innovative technology fast to market at an affordable price. 
Turning to capital deployment. We acquired 2 small companies in June for $69 million and entered into an agreement to acquire 2 more companies in July for approximately $200 million. Applied Defense Solutions, which we acquired last month, is an important addition to our space portfolio. It is a business we know well, and we expect it to have an immediate impact on our new business pursuits. 
The 2 related companies we announced in July are leaders in computer network operations and vulnerability research. We acquired these businesses at an attractive 9x estimated 2018 EBITDA multiple and 7x estimated 2019 EBITDA. This business enhances our capability and the convergence of electronic warfare and cybersecurity, enabling us to expand and enhance our C6ISR offerings globally. 
In addition to acquisitions, we frontloaded our share repurchase for the year. We purchased $168 million worth of our stock in the second quarter, atop $119 million in Q1 for first a half total of $287 million. In addition, we repurchased $34 million in July for a year-to-date total of $321 million. 
In closing, we are moving fast and have accomplished a lot in the first 6 months of this year, and we're just getting started. Transforming L3 into a truly world-class company will require time, hard work and dedication from everyone at L3. Our employees and leadership have firmly embraced this challenge and change. 
I want to thank the entire L3 team for taking us on this journey. 
Now I will turn it over to Ralph to go over our financial performance and outlook."
93538,574355480,1510592,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted ear",858,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
Segment operating margin, excluding a property gain in the second quarter of last year, was unchanged at 10.6%. As Chris said, we also increased our R&D spending, and that was by $19 million quarter-over-quarter to fuel future growth, and that higher R&D lowered second quarter margin by 70 basis points.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.47, and it increased 20% excluding the $42 million property gain in the 2017 second quarter. Adjusted EPS excludes the debt retirement charges of $0.45 and a gain of $0.31 on the sale of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which we sold with Vertex. These 2 items were not contemplated in our prior year 2018 guidance. 
Second quarter sales increased 8% to $2.6 billion, with strong organic growth of 7.5%, driven by 10% growth in our U.S. Department of Defense business. Sales growth was strong at Sensors, Aerospace, Electronics, with each growing 22%, 9% and 6%, respectively. 
At Communications, sales were about flat. Second quarter operating margin was 10.6% and lower than the 11% we expected because Communication Systems margin lagged again at 8.1%. I'll explain this all [ through ] Communication Systems margin when I review the 2018 guidance update in a few moments. And I'll tell you that we -- despite those softer margins, we have maintained our 2018 consolidated margin guidance of 11.2%. 
Segment margins for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors were in line or better than our full year estimates. Sensor Systems margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% as expected primarily due to higher R&D spending, which we planned for, and that was $17 million. In fact, we accelerate R&D spending in the second quarter to take advantage of certain new business opportunities in that segment. Free cash flow was [ $165 ] million for the second quarter. 
And now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased adjusted EPS by $0.40 or 4% at the midpoint to $9.90 due to higher sales and operating income as well as lower interest expense and taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, EPS will grow 17% compared to last year.
We increased our sales guidance midpoint by $150 million to $10.1 billion, and we expect sales to grow 6% over 2017. 
We continue to expect total segment operating margin of 11.2% for 2018, and that will expand 40 basis points over 2017. And combined with our sales growth, we expect segment operating income to increase 10% year-over-year.
We revised our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints to 14%  for Electronics, which is up 30 basis points, 12.5% for Sensors, up 70 basis points, 8% for Aerospace, which is up 10 basis points, and 10% for Communications, which is down 100 basis points. 
We reduced margin guidance for Communication Systems for 2 items. First, production orders for broadband communications have remained sluggish, causing us to lower those sales for 2018. Second, at the traveling wave tube businesses in space and power sector, while we completed the consolidation of those businesses in April, their return to normal manufacturing productivity and yields is happening at a slower pace than we planned. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered interest expense for the savings from our recent debt refinancing, and we also lowered the estimated tax rate. We increased estimated free cash flow for the year to [ $915 ] million. 
Regarding capital allocation, Chris covered the recent acquisitions and share repurchase activity. So I'll add that with respect to share repurchases, since our year-to-date July, repurchases are $321 million, which is above our previous plan of $300 million. We could repurchase up to $400 million for this year, depending on acquisition activity, and there are a few other deals that we're presently looking at. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of the Vertex businesses on June 29, and the final net proceeds after paying taxes on the gain of that sale should be about $430 million. 
Also, with respect to our recent debt refinancings, they'll reduce our annual interest expense by $15 million. We incurred $69 million of debt retirement charges totaling $0.66 per share. And since the debt retirements straddled June and July, $48 million of those charges were recorded at the second quarter, and the remaining $21 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Taking a quick look at our third quarter. We expect sales of at least $2.5 billion, operating margin of about 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.40, which excludes the third quarter debt retirement charge of $0.20.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had very solid orders, sales and EPS growth in the second quarter. We're investing more in R&D. We raised guidance for the full year. We are allocating capital to grow to increase shareholder value, and we have ample resources and liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

We have the cadet training program where we bring in 1,600 cadets a year for about an 18-month program where they come in having never flown an airplane and leaving flying for a commercial airline. We have the simulators that we sell, but we're seeing more and more with the airline, the desire for them to outsource and use our school houses, if you will. And I announced at the Farnborough Airshow our $100 million investment in Gatwick, where we're going to have the ability to run 24/7 8 full flight simulators, adjoined to the property where we'll be able to also build that. So we're quite optimistic. There's clearly a shortage, at least 30,000 pilots per year by all forecasts. And that's driven both from retirements and then the increase in aircraft. So I'll turn it over to Ralph to give you some numbers that we're looking at. But we're very excited about what we've done, and we also have consolidated all those aviation capabilities as a one-stop shop. Ralph, you want to..."

So maybe a somewhat unusual, but we are going to go after a commercial airline together because our combined capabilities is what the customer needed. I think the FlightSafety is more general aviation and not really in the same market as we are, although maybe we compete on the military side. So there's more than enough players. I think there's 7 or 8 that are somewhat well recognized. Our goal is to be #1 or 2 in every market that we embark it, and we're going to aggressively grow organically, make acquisitions, partner and team. And I think a lot of the airlines that we've had discussions with may be interested in just unloading their assets, their simulators and the responsibilities to a company like L3, and we may be in position to take those over. So we're going to go very aggressive. And highly confident we'll be quite successful."

And that's why our theme is integration and growth, I get it, it's 2 things at once. I think a perfect example, this quarter with Sensors in particular but the corporation in total, we accelerated our R&D, and I think it was about $17 million in Sensors. Again, they grew 22%. And I'll say what I've said every quarter, I have absolutely no problem spending money in the near term, whether it's R&D, whether it's severance, whether it's restructuring, taking charges, spending the money for the long-term growth of this company and understanding the complications of doing that. I think we balanced it pretty well. And the more you grow, the more volume you have, in theory the higher your margins get to absorb a lot of your fixed costs. So we've got a pretty sophisticated model we look at. We're highly confident in the 12% in '19, and we plan to grow organically and inorganically.

With respect to the second quarter itself, we did have some rather meaningful sales happen toward the end of June. For example, in Aerospace Systems, we had taken a conservative position with the [ EC 37 B] or Compass Call [ repack, ] and we ended up booking the second aircraft procurement and taking it to sales toward the end of that month. So there's about $40 million that's sitting in receivables just from that item.

So I think L3 is uniquely positioned to try to keep up and move quickly with our customers, and they're actually doing what they're saying, which I think is quite exciting. On the ground combat vehicles within our Electronics segment, we do have combat propulsion systems up in Michigan. They do a lot with the engines here in the U.S. and internationally, and that business has been growing. So I think we have a play there that we're working on.

So with respect to top line, I explained, as we lowered the estimated sales by $100 million for the year, and that is in the broadband communications sector. On the last earnings conference call, where I talked about where sales were trending by segment, I did explain that we were trending to a low end of sales for Communication Systems segment. I also had explained that the pickup in sales that we were anticipating was contingent on booking certain orders later on in the year. So I said today that the production in order volume has remained sluggish. And as Chris explained, we are seeing some nice wins, which is mostly development work for next-gen communication type work. So the business in broadband communications is transitioning to more development cost type work versus fixed price reduction work, and that definitely weighs on the operating margins. 
So with respect to the reduction in the Comm Systems margins of 100 basis points this year, I said that the main item or the first item was that lower sales volume. In broadband communication systems, that's probably 2/3 of the reduction in operating income and margin in that segment guidance, and that's a business that will be about 1.2 billion sales this year. So those sales have been declining about 8% year-over-year. The other item impacting the margins is the traveling wave tube or TWT businesses. And you recall that those are 2 businesses that we consolidate over the last year and a half plus. We completed the consolidation in April, and I said that we're not yet experiencing what we would consider to be normal manufacturing yields of productivity on those traveling wave tubes. We're going to get there beginning in the second half of this year, and we started to see some improvement in June. I'll also tell you that in terms of manufacturing complexity, Traveling-Wave Tubes is among the most complex type of manufacturing that we do, it entails a lot of calibration and tuning activity. And those skill sets we had to rebuild with new employees and train those new employees, so it's taken us a little longer than we thought to get there on the operating margins."

The goal is to optimize the business, make us even more agile, more lean and more responsive to our customers. And the geography of where the people reside and where they're charged, I think the entire gets it that it really doesn't matter. So other than maybe bringing on our Chief Transformation Officer to coordinate and orchestrate all these moving parts that we keep what's working and budget the costs of some of these things, the recovery, the business case over a 2- to 3-year period that it's going to take is kind of the goal.

And L3, I understand it's hard to think about just having 1 franchise program that we could put on the cover of our annual report. But I think our ISR capabilities are the best in the world. And when I look at the capabilities we have at Aerospace and the enabling technologies within Sensors and Communications, it's how do we put these things better together to go to market. So we just met earlier this week to review the R&D plan for Sensors and the corporation, and I expect it to maintain the current pace. And when we can get these type of quick results, it's a no-brainer. I think in the Electronics, we're doing a fair amount in the classified arena. And also on the Commercial side, we're going to try to grow the -- or double the commercial aviation new business that we set up, which includes the avionics and the training.

The '17 stuff is still too early to evaluate. We did get some good interesting acquisitions this quarter. And again, a lot of these are built on relationships. I think at least 3 to 4, we've known the companies and the owners for years, and we've worked with them, supported them. And at the right time, we enter these deals. So we try not to get into these auctions and bidding wars. I mean, obviously, we work with the bankers on an as-needed basis.  But a lot of these, as we talked about, want to be part of L3. We have success stories, they come in, they meet other entrepreneurs that we've acquired that are still with us. And it's that same theme that we have talked about for years is that it's the balance of maintaining that entrepreneurial spirit with the scale of a major corporation.  And that's our secret sauce. I think we're doing that well. Consolidation as a division is in no way impacts that. And we said we do easily -- we could do up to $1 billion a year in M&A and still keep our investment ratings -- investment credit ratings. So there's no walking back from there, and there's really no limitation on the sizes. We take what's available. I said before, I'd rather do $200 million and $500 million. But if they're not out there, we'll continue to do the $69 million ones, the $200 million ones and whatever's available. So we've got a great process, a good pipeline. And like I said, I think we'll announce another one probably within a month maybe in the $100 million range, and we've got a couple others we're looking at. And some will close and some won't. But clearly, accretive deals is our preference unless it's a technology buy that accelerates our R&D effort for the long term. So I hope that helps, Jon."

We historically had 3% of our revenue in R&D. I think we've taken it up a notch. Again, we're doing a better job aligning with where our customers are spending their money. They've laid out a national security and a national defense strategy, which is helpful. And again, the situational awareness, whether it's on the ISR front and the movement to business jets where we invested in miniaturizing some of our capabilities. It's all about lethality, speed to market, interconnectivity. The Comm segment, which we talked about a little bit, none of us are happy where we are, but one of the top priorities around the world is the connectivity. These fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft, and like I said before, they need to be able to communicate data in a contested environment. It's well documented that, that is lagging, and we'll continue to invest in those capabilities. And I'm excited about the opportunity to get those requirements into the procurement process. So we are doing a couple of things differently. We have these innovation sprints. I think last I looked, we were up to 35 so far this year, where we have a week, we put people together and try to solve a problem in a week. And we're getting more bang for the buck, spending less R&D by setting these targets and goals. And you can learn a lot in a week if you get 5, 7, 10 men and women in a room with a set problem, a set budget and it's been pretty exciting. So autonomy is big. Secured comm is big.

We have about $10 billion revenue top line company right now. Aspirationally, we want to get larger. But historically, a few years ago, we thought the minimum was closer to 200, but that was really as we looked at how to start combining the divisions. Clearly, in this industry, a little larger is better. So the 500 number doesn't strike me as being unreasonable. You get the scale to optimize the systems. But again, as we're looking these things more top-down than a bottoms-up perspective, it's really the production, the manufacturing, the innovation that needs to reside in the divisions and sector. I think 500 is a good number. As far as upcoming awards, Ralph, trying to think which ones we highlight. C-130 [ AMP ] is a big one, but that's probably late fourth quarter, early '19. I mean, we literally have hundreds of programs. I'm not sure if there's anything that's going to move the needle up or down significantly. F-16 trainer recompete. We have some international things.

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. 
As you saw this morning, we reported solid quarterly results. Consistent with our integration and growth theme, we delivered 8% year-over-year growth in both operating income and sales. Second quarter organic growth of 7% is the highest rate we've achieved in about a decade and speaks to both the improving execution on our growth initiative in addition to being well positioned in growing markets, including defense, security and commercial pilot training. 
Our book-to-bill was 1.1, which includes only $15 million of the initial funding for the $391 million BNVBG night vision goggles program. Funded orders were up 32% in the quarter led by strength in Aerospace. And based on our year-to-date performance and a continued positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our guidance for sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. 
I returned last week from the Farnborough Airshow with my team where we had our most productive show ever. We had 1,000 guests to our chalet and pavilion and conducted over 200 meetings with customers, partners and global government leaders. We showcased our technology as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime and also announced the recent hire of Steve O'Brien, our new Senior Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. I've been focusing on strengthening our leadership talent, and Steve is the latest addition who is an experienced and respected industry leader. 
At our Annual Meeting in May, 2 of our directors chose not to stand for reelection, and Rita Lane was unanimously appointed to be our newest member of the board. Rita is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and spent her career in operations at 3 Fortune 100 companies, including Apple. Her high-tech and operations expertise is certain to help us, and she brings a refreshing and vital Silicon Valley perspective to our company. 
We kicked off of the year with a theme of integration, collaboration and innovation, and I want to report back to you on the progress now that we're midway through the year. When I took over, I saw an important need for the enterprise to work more efficiently, be more collaborative and increase our effectiveness at helping our customers solve their most complex and pressing problems. 
We're making progress to get better integrated and are evaluating plans for realignment. First, along every functional area, we are developing plans on standardizing and streamlining processes, systems and policies. 
For example, in the area of IT, our CIO will have company-wide responsibility for integrating our IT systems, and we will realize improved efficiencies, better security and lower costs. In HR, we're streamlining many legacy policies. And based on feedback from a company-wide employee survey, we're developing leadership and training programs to invigorate our workforce. 
As a high-tech growth company, our engineering workforce and their development are part of the lifeblood of this company, responsible for driving innovation that ultimately fuels our growth. 
If you will recall, I hired a new leader of engineering earlier this year, and he's been coordinating the efforts to elevate and promote the role of engineering in building our advantage for the future. We're taking steps to connect our engineering community to enhance collaboration, standardization and upgrade in our engineering tools and capabilities as well as investing in training and professional development. 
We are continuing to sectorize our 70-plus divisions and consolidate select operating facilities to drive greater efficiency. The Electronic Systems segment is leading this effort with the goal of reducing its divisions by half. This is a multiyear effort, which we expect to complete by 2021. 
Consistent with our strategy of becoming a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime, we've been evaluating the alignment of our capabilities and core competencies across the reporting segments. In order to move up the food chain and deliver more integrated solutions, we need to be better coordinated in developing technology and agile in addressing customer needs. Therefore, we're reviewing plans to consolidate from 3 -- from 4 segments to 3 segments. We'll be finalizing this plan in August, and we'll provide additional detail at that time. 
Change is never easy with a large company, and there are many steps in a sequence to coordinate the gearing, so the engine of the corporation runs better. Many customers are underserved relative to their needs for fast innovative low-cost solutions, and we intend to fill that need as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime. I'm encouraged by discussions with the Department of Defense and many international customers. 
Our teams are starting to think more creatively about harnessing the power of L3's technologies to move up the value chain. This shift in how we go to market will take time, but I want you as shareholders to know what we're working towards as the company and what I'm expecting of my team. 
Let's now turn to the quarter's results. In terms of sales, all segments grew sales in the quarter led by Sensor Systems, which was up 22%. Our renewed focus on driving growth and targeted business development activities are bearing fruit with first half book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Turning to our segments. Aerospace Systems had a good quarter, improving both financially and operationally. We converted several of our long-term pursuits in the quarter, our aircraft recapitalization and fleet expansion. Moreover, we continue to pursue U.S. and international opportunities, and we expect the growth to continue into the second half of the year. 
Communication Systems continues to be a challenge. While we are seeing a pickup in military demand for traveling wave tubes, the commercial satellite market continues to face headwinds. However, the Communication's segment long-term growth prospects are bright with ongoing development work in Free Space Optics and electronic warfare that will yield production work in the years ahead. We won several initial awards in targeted areas such as classified space, Maritime C4ISR and electronic warfare that open up opportunities for much larger awards. 
Electronic Systems continues to deliver solid results across a broad array of programs. On the commercial side, our Security & Detection Systems had a strong sales in order -- quarter driven by explosive trace detection and workflow solutions. On the defense side, we booked strong orders from precision engagement and power and propulsion.
Sensor Systems was again our fastest growth segment. As planned, our operating margins were down year-over-year due to increased R&D investment. Order growth was particularly strong in WESCAM and Maritime. We're also investing in several next-generation technologies, such as directed energy and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles that will drive future growth for L3. 
One highlight for sensors was a 3-year $390 million next-generation night vision goggle award for 13,000 units; 10,000 for the Army and 3,000 for the Marines. Consistent with our customers' desire to move rapidly, the Army and L3 has been alpha contracting processed to negotiate and complete the deal in about 60 days. This 10,000 unit initial orders positions us to compete for the Army's planned purchase of 100,000 night vision goggles in the years ahead. This is a case in point of bringing a disruptive and innovative technology fast to market at an affordable price. 
Turning to capital deployment. We acquired 2 small companies in June for $69 million and entered into an agreement to acquire 2 more companies in July for approximately $200 million. Applied Defense Solutions, which we acquired last month, is an important addition to our space portfolio. It is a business we know well, and we expect it to have an immediate impact on our new business pursuits. 
The 2 related companies we announced in July are leaders in computer network operations and vulnerability research. We acquired these businesses at an attractive 9x estimated 2018 EBITDA multiple and 7x estimated 2019 EBITDA. This business enhances our capability and the convergence of electronic warfare and cybersecurity, enabling us to expand and enhance our C6ISR offerings globally. 
In addition to acquisitions, we frontloaded our share repurchase for the year. We purchased $168 million worth of our stock in the second quarter, atop $119 million in Q1 for a first half total of $287 million. In addition, we repurchased $34 million in July for a year-to-date total of $321 million. 
In closing, we are moving fast and have accomplished a lot in the first 6 months of this year, and we're just getting started. Transforming L3 into a truly world-class company will require time, hard work and dedication from everyone at L3. Our employees and leadership have firmly embraced this challenge and change. 
I want to thank the entire L3 team for taking us on this journey. 
Now I will turn it over to Ralph to go over our financial performance and outlook."
93538,574355480,1510901,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted ear",855,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
Segment operating margin, excluding a property gain in the second quarter of last year, was unchanged at 10.6%. As Chris said, we also increased our R&D spending, and that was by $19 million quarter-over-quarter to fuel future growth, and that higher R&D lowered second quarter margin by 70 basis points.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.47, and it increased 20% excluding the $42 million property gain in the 2017 second quarter. Adjusted EPS excludes the debt retirement charges of $0.45 and a gain of $0.31 on the sale of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which we sold with Vertex. These 2 items were not contemplated in our prior year 2018 guidance. 
Second quarter sales increased 8% to $2.6 billion, with strong organic growth of 7.5%, driven by 10% growth in our U.S. Department of Defense business. Sales growth was strong at Sensors, Aerospace, Electronics, with each growing 22%, 9% and 6%, respectively. 
At Communications, sales were about flat. Second quarter operating margin was 10.6% and lower than the 11% we expected because Communication Systems margin lagged again at 8.1%. I'll explain this all [ through ] Communication Systems margin when I review the 2018 guidance update in a few moments. And I'll tell you that we -- despite those softer margins, we have maintained our 2018 consolidated margin guidance of 11.2%. 
Segment margins for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors were in line or better than our full year estimates. Sensor Systems margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% as expected primarily due to higher R&D spending, which we planned for, and that was $17 million. In fact, we accelerate R&D spending in the second quarter to take advantage of certain new business opportunities in that segment. Free cash flow was $165 million for the second quarter. 
And now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased adjusted EPS by $0.40 or 4% at the midpoint to $9.90 due to higher sales and operating income as well as lower interest expense and taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, EPS will grow 17% compared to last year.
We increased our sales guidance midpoint by $150 million to $10.1 billion, and we expect sales to grow 6% over 2017. 
We continue to expect total segment operating margin of 11.2% for 2018, and that will expand 40 basis points over 2017. And combined with our sales growth, we expect segment operating income to increase 10% year-over-year.
We revised our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints to 14% for Electronics, which is up 30 basis points, 12.5% for Sensors, up 70 basis points, 8% for Aerospace, which is up 10 basis points, and 10% for Communications, which is down 100 basis points. 
We reduced margin guidance for Communication Systems for 2 items. First, production orders for broadband communications have remained sluggish, causing us to lower those sales for 2018. Second, at the traveling wave tube businesses in the space and power sector, while we completed the consolidation of those businesses in April, their return to normal manufacturing productivity and yields is happening at a slower pace than we planned. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered interest expense for the savings from our recent debt refinancing, and we also lowered the estimated tax rate. We increased estimated free cash flow for the year to $915 million. 
Regarding capital allocation, Chris covered the recent acquisitions and share repurchase activity. So I'll add that with respect to share repurchases, since our year-to-date July, repurchases are $321 million, which is above our previous plan of $300 million. We could repurchase up to $400 million for this year, depending on acquisition activity, and there are a few other deals that we're presently looking at. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of the Vertex businesses on June 29, and the final net proceeds after paying taxes on the gain of that sale should be about $430 million. 
Also, with respect to our recent debt refinancings, they'll reduce our annual interest expense by $15 million. We incurred $69 million of debt retirement charges totaling $0.66 per share. And since the debt retirements straddled June and July, $48 million of those charges were recorded at the second quarter, and the remaining $21 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Taking a quick look at our third quarter. We expect sales of at least $2.5 billion, operating margin of about 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.40, which excludes the third quarter debt retirement charge of $0.20.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had very solid orders, sales and EPS growth in the second quarter. We're investing more in R&D. We raised guidance for the full year. We are allocating capital to grow to increase shareholder value, and we have ample resources and liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

We have the cadet training program where we bring in 1,600 cadets a year for about an 18-month program where they come in having never flown an airplane and leaving flying for a commercial airline. We have the simulators that we sell, but we're seeing more and more with the airline, the desire for them to outsource and use our schoolhouses, if you will. And I announced at the Farnborough Airshow our $100 million investment in Gatwick, where we're going to have the ability to run 24/7 8 full flight simulators, adjoined to the property where we'll be able to also build that. So we're quite optimistic. There's clearly a shortage, at least 30,000 pilots per year by all forecasts. And that's driven both from retirements and then the increase in aircraft.

I think there's 7 or 8 that are somewhat well recognized. Our goal is to be #1 or 2 in every market that we embark in, and we're going to aggressively grow organically, make acquisitions, partner and team. And I think a lot of the airlines that we've had discussions with may be interested in just unloading their assets, their simulators and the responsibilities to a company like L3, and we may be in a position to take those over.

And I think I've been pretty clear starting last year really focusing on the integration story and the progress we've made. And then with the defense budget improving, I did add the growth side. And that's why our theme is integration and growth, I get it, it's 2 things at once. I think a perfect example, this quarter with Sensors in particular but the corporation in total, we accelerated our R&D, and I think it was about $17 million in Sensors. Again, they grew 22%. And I'll say what I've said every quarter, I have absolutely no problem spending money in the near term, whether it's R&D, whether it's severance, whether it's restructuring, taking charges, spending the money for the long-term growth of this company and understanding the complications of doing that. I think we balanced it pretty well. And the more you grow, the more volume you have, in theory the higher your margins get to absorb a lot of your fixed costs. So we've got a pretty sophisticated model we look at. We're highly confident in the 12% in '19, and we plan to grow organically and inorganically.

With respect to the second quarter itself, we did have some rather meaningful sales happen toward the end of June. For example, in Aerospace Systems, we had taken a conservative position with the [ EC 37 B] or Compass Call [ repack, ] and we ended up booking the second aircraft procurement and taking it to sales toward the end of that month. So there's about $40 million that's sitting in receivables just from that item. And then we've also had some very large shipments of night vision equipment into the Middle East toward the end of June, and that accounts for another $15 million to $20 million of bills and working capital that's going to liquidate, or be collected in the second half of this year."

On the ground combat vehicles within our Electronics segment, we do have combat propulsion systems up in Michigan. They do a lot with the engines here in the U.S. and internationally, and that business has been growing. So I think we have a play there that we're working on.

So if you could walk me through that, and I don't know if it's possible to size that business so we could sort of understand where it's gone this year versus last.

So with respect to top line, I explained, as we lowered the estimated sales by $100 million for the year, and that is in the broadband communications sector. On the last earnings conference call, where I talked about where sales were trending by segment, I did explain that we were trending to a low end of sales for Communication Systems segment. I also had explained that the pickup in sales that we were anticipating was contingent on booking certain orders later on in the year. So I said today that the production order volume has remained sluggish. And as Chris explained, we are seeing some nice wins, which is mostly development work for next-gen communication type work. So the business in broadband communications is transitioning to more development cost type work versus fixed price reduction work, and that definitely weighs on the operating margins. 
So with respect to the reduction in the Comm Systems margins of 100 basis points this year, I said that the main item or the first item was that lower sales volume. In broadband communication systems, that's probably 2/3 of the reduction in operating income and margin in that segment guidance, and that's a business that will be about 1.2 billion sales this year. So those sales have been declining about 8% year-over-year. The other item impacting the margins is the Traveling Wave Tube or TWT businesses. And you recall that those are 2 businesses that we consolidate over the last year and a half plus. We completed the consolidation in April, and I said that we're not yet experiencing what we would consider to be normal manufacturing yields of productivity on those traveling wave tubes. We're going to get there beginning in the second half of this year, and we started to see some improvement in June. I'll also tell you that in terms of manufacturing complexity, Traveling-Wave Tubes is among the most complex type of manufacturing that we do, it entails a lot of calibration and tuning activity. And those skill sets we had to rebuild with new employees and train those new employees, so it's taken us a little longer than we thought to get there on the operating margins."

So we have plenty of resources, plenty of cash."

So I didn't want to say that we said 300, we met 300 we're done, threw another 100 on the table and kind of go month-to-month. I can assure you the team meets regularly and evaluates the market and the opportunities. And I think we have another acquisition hopefully in the next 30 days that we'll announce. And we've got a lot going on, and we monitor it. I'm surprised that we ended the year with $1 billion cash balance, but -- and at this point, this is what we're willing to say."

And I really don't get caught up as to whether they're in a shared service cost pool or corporate pool or 70 different divisional pools. The goal is to optimize the business, make us even more agile, more lean and more responsive to our customers. And the geography of where the people reside and where they're charged, I think the entire team gets it, that it really doesn't matter. So other than maybe bringing on a Chief Transformation Officer to coordinate and orchestrate all these moving parts that we keep what's working and budget the costs of some of these things, the recovery, the business case over the 2- to 3-year period that it's going to take is kind of the goal. So I would not anticipate a significant change in headcount at corporate, but I'm looking at things in totality for all of L3. And I could envision another 400, 500 layoffs by the end of the calendar year as we continue to optimize the business in the months ahead."

So it's not surprising that these capabilities are in high demand. We've been investing on several fronts to move these products forward, both on less power, less weight and better capability. And L3, I understand it's hard to think about just having 1 franchise program that we could put on the cover of our annual report. But I think our ISR capabilities are the best in the world. And when I look at the capabilities we have at Aerospace and the enabling technologies within Sensors and Communications, it's how do we put these things better together to go to market. So we just met earlier this week to review the R&D plan for Sensors and the corporation, and I expect it to maintain the current pace. And when we can get these types of quick results, it's a no-brainer. I think in the Electronics, we're doing a fair amount in the classified arena. And also on the Commercial side, we're going to try to grow the -- or double the commercial aviation new business that we set up, which includes the avionics and the training. We've been investing in new simulators, as you know. And the Security & Detection, one of my favorite products, the ClearScan detector is starting to get traction in Europe. Hopefully, it will get traction in the U.S. And as we all travel to airports, hopefully you'll see more L3 systems in these airports to get you to your flights quicker and safer than before."

No, thanks for that, Jon. I mean, we do monitor these acquisitions. A couple of weeks ago, we were looking at the 2016 acquisitions, and they are effectively a little over 9x EBITDA multiple this year relative to what we paid for them in '16. The '17 stuff is still too early to evaluate. We did get some good interesting acquisitions this quarter. And again, a lot of these are built on relationships. I think at least 3 to 4, we've known the companies and the owners for years, and we've worked with them, supported them. And at the right time, we enter these deals. So we try not to get into these auctions and bidding wars. I mean, obviously, we work with the bankers on an as-needed basis.  But a lot of these, as we talked about, want to be part of L3. We have success stories, they come in, they meet other entrepreneurs that we've acquired that are still with us. And it's that same theme that we have talked about for years is that it's the balance of maintaining that entrepreneurial spirit with the scale of a major corporation.  And that's our secret sauce. I think we're doing that well. Consolidation as a division is in no way impacts that. And we said we do easily -- we could do up to $1 billion a year in M&A and still keep our investment ratings -- investment credit ratings. So there's no walking back from there, and there's really no limitation on the sizes. We take what's available. I said before, I'd rather do $200 million and $500 million. But if they're not out there, we'll continue to do the $69 million ones, the $200 million ones and whatever's available. So we've got a great process, a good pipeline. And like I said, I think we'll announce another one probably within a month maybe in the $100 million range, and we've got a couple others we're looking at. And some will close and some won't. But clearly, accretive deals is our preference unless it's a technology buy that accelerates our R&D effort for the long term. So I hope that helps, Jon."

But I like it. We'll work that into our branding and marketing. We are all sitting around in jeans and T-shirts today, so maybe we are making progress after all. We historically had 3% of our revenue in R&D. I think we've taken it up a notch. Again, we're doing a better job aligning with where our customers are spending their money. They've laid out a national security and a national defense strategy, which is helpful. And again, the situational awareness, whether it's on the ISR front and the movement to business jets where we invested in miniaturizing some of our capabilities. It's all about lethality, speed to market, interconnectivity. The Comm segment, which we talked about a little bit, and none of us are happy where we are, but one of the top priorities around the world is the connectivity. These fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft, and like I said before, they need to be able to communicate and pass data in a contested environment. It's well documented that, that is lagging, and we'll continue to invest in those capabilities. And I'm excited about the opportunity to get those requirements into the procurement process. So we are doing a couple of things differently. We have these innovation sprints. I think last I looked, we were up to 35 so far this year, where we have a week, we put people together and try to solve a problem in a week. And we're getting more bang for the buck, spending less R&D by setting these targets and goals. And you can learn a lot in a week if you get 5, 7, 10 men and women in a room with a set problem, a set budget and it's been pretty exciting. So autonomy is big. Secured comms is big. What we've been doing in UUVs, maybe UAVs, supporting small [ fab ] payloads, those types of things is where we're spending our money."

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you saw this morning, we reported solid quarterly results. Consistent with our integration and growth theme, we delivered 8% year-over-year growth in both operating income and sales. Second quarter o",1452,"Okay. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. 
As you saw this morning, we reported solid quarterly results. Consistent with our integration and growth theme, we delivered 8% year-over-year growth in both operating income and sales. Second quarter organic growth of 7% is the highest rate we've achieved in about a decade and speaks to both the improving execution on our growth initiative in addition to being well positioned in growing markets, including defense, security and commercial pilot training. 
Our book-to-bill was 1.1, which includes only $15 million of the initial funding for the $391 million BNVBG night vision goggles program. Funded orders were up 32% in the quarter led by strength in Aerospace. And based on our year-to-date performance and a continued positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our guidance for sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. 
I returned last week from the Farnborough Airshow with my team where we had our most productive show ever. We had 1,000 guests to our chalet and pavilion and conducted over 200 meetings with customers, partners and global government leaders. We showcased our technology as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime and also announced the recent hire of Steve O'Brien, our new Senior Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. I've been focusing on strengthening our leadership talent, and Steve is the latest addition who is an experienced and respected industry leader. 
At our Annual Meeting in May, 2 of our directors chose not to stand for reelection, and Rita Lane was unanimously appointed to be our newest member of the board. Rita is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and spent her career in operations at 3 Fortune 100 companies, including Apple. Her high-tech and operations expertise is certain to help us, and she brings a refreshing and vital Silicon Valley perspective to our company. 
We kicked off of the year with a theme of integration, collaboration and innovation, and I want to report back to you on the progress now that we're midway through the year. When I took over, I saw an important need for the enterprise to work more efficiently, be more collaborative and increase our effectiveness at helping our customers solve their most complex and pressing problems. 
We're making progress to get better integrated and are evaluating plans for realignment. First, along every functional area, we are developing plans on standardizing and streamlining processes, systems and policies. 
For example, in the area of IT, our CIO will have company-wide responsibility for integrating our IT systems, and we will realize improved efficiencies, better security and lower costs. In HR, we're streamlining many legacy policies. And based on feedback from a company-wide employee survey, we're developing leadership and training programs to invigorate our workforce. 
As a high-tech growth company, our engineering workforce and their development are part of the lifeblood of this company, responsible for driving innovation that ultimately fuels our growth. 
If you will recall, I hired a new leader of engineering earlier this year, and he's been coordinating the efforts to elevate and promote the role of engineering in building our advantage for the future. We're taking steps to connect our engineering community to enhance collaboration, standardization and upgrade in our engineering tools and capabilities as well as investing in training and professional development. 
We are continuing to sectorize our 70-plus divisions and consolidate select operating facilities to drive greater efficiency. The Electronic Systems segment is leading this effort with the goal of reducing its divisions by half. This is a multiyear effort, which we expect to complete by 2021. 
Consistent with our strategy of becoming a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime, we've been evaluating the alignment of our capabilities and core competencies across the reporting segments. In order to move up the food chain and deliver more integrated solutions, we need to be better coordinated in developing technology and agile in addressing customer needs. Therefore, we're reviewing plans to consolidate from 3 -- from 4 segments to 3 segments. We'll be finalizing this plan in August, and we'll provide additional detail at that time. 
Change is never easy with a large company, and there are many steps in a sequence to coordinate the gearing, so the engine of the corporation runs better. Many customers are underserved relative to their needs for fast innovative low-cost solutions, and we intend to fill that need as a nontraditional [ fixed ] prime. I'm encouraged by discussions with the Department of Defense and many international customers. 
Our teams are starting to think more creatively about harnessing the power of L3's technologies to move up the value chain. This shift in how we go to market will take time, but I want you as shareholders to know what we're working towards as the company and what I'm expecting of my team. 
Let's now turn to the quarter's results. In terms of sales, all segments grew sales in the quarter led by Sensor Systems, which was up 22%. Our renewed focus on driving growth and targeted business development activities are bearing fruit with first half book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Turning to our segments. Aerospace Systems had a good quarter, improving both financially and operationally. We converted several of our long-term pursuits in the quarter, our aircraft recapitalization and fleet expansion. Moreover, we continue to pursue U.S. and international opportunities, and we expect the growth to continue into the second half of the year. 
Communication Systems continues to be a challenge. While we are seeing a pickup in military demand for traveling wave tubes, the commercial satellite market continues to face headwinds. However, the Communication's segment long-term growth prospects are bright with ongoing development work in Free Space Optics and electronic warfare that will yield production work in the years ahead. We won several initial awards in targeted areas such as classified space, Maritime C4ISR and electronic warfare that open up opportunities for much larger awards. 
Electronic Systems continues to deliver solid results across a broad array of programs. On the commercial side, our Security & Detection Systems had a strong sales in order -- quarter driven by explosive trace detection and workflow solutions. On the defense side, we booked strong orders from precision engagement and power and propulsion.
Sensor Systems was again our fastest growth segment. As planned, our operating margins were down year-over-year due to increased R&D investment. Order growth was particularly strong in WESCAM and Maritime. We're also investing in several next-generation technologies, such as directed energy and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles that will drive future growth for L3. 
One highlight for sensors was a 3-year $390 million next-generation night vision goggle award for 13,000 units; 10,000 for the Army and 3,000 for the Marines. Consistent with our customers' desire to move rapidly, the Army and L3 has been alpha contracting processed to negotiate and complete the deal in about 60 days. This 10,000 unit initial orders positions us to compete for the Army's planned purchase of 100,000 night vision goggles in the years ahead. This is a case in point of bringing a disruptive and innovative technology fast to market at an affordable price. 
Turning to capital deployment. We acquired 2 small companies in June for $69 million and entered into an agreement to acquire 2 more companies in July for approximately $200 million. Applied Defense Solutions, which we acquired last month, is an important addition to our space portfolio. It is a business we know well, and we expect it to have an immediate impact on our new business pursuits. 
The 2 related companies we announced in July are leaders in computer network operations and vulnerability research. We acquired these businesses at an attractive 9x estimated 2018 EBITDA multiple and 7x estimated 2019 EBITDA. This business enhances our capability and the convergence of electronic warfare and cybersecurity, enabling us to expand and enhance our C6ISR offerings globally. 
In addition to acquisitions, we frontloaded our share repurchase for the year. We purchased $168 million worth of our stock in the second quarter, atop $119 million in Q1 for a first half total of $287 million. In addition, we repurchased $34 million in July for a year-to-date total of $321 million. 
In closing, we are moving fast and have accomplished a lot in the first 6 months of this year, and we're just getting started. Transforming L3 into a truly world-class company will require time, hard work and dedication from everyone at L3. Our employees and leadership have firmly embraced this challenge and change. 
I want to thank the entire L3 team for taking us on this journey. 
Now I will turn it over to Ralph to go over our financial performance and outlook."
93538,574355480,1512307,"L3 Technologies, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted ear",855,"Thank you, Chris. I'll review some details about the second quarter and our 2018 guidance update. 
Reviewing the second quarter, we had solid operating results and/or outlook, with strong growth in orders, sales, segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
Segment operating margin, excluding a property gain in the second quarter of last year, was unchanged at 10.6%. As Chris said, we also increased our R&D spending, and that was by $19 million quarter-over-quarter to fuel future growth, and that higher R&D lowered second quarter margin by 70 basis points.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.47, and it increased 20% excluding the $42 million property gain in the 2017 second quarter. Adjusted EPS excludes the debt retirement charges of $0.45 and a gain of $0.31 on the sale of the Crestview and TCS businesses, which we sold with Vertex. These 2 items were not contemplated in our prior year 2018 guidance. 
Second quarter sales increased 8% to $2.6 billion, with strong organic growth of 7.5%, driven by 10% growth in our U.S. Department of Defense business. Sales growth was strong at Sensors, Aerospace, Electronics, with each growing 22%, 9% and 6%, respectively. 
At Communications, sales were about flat. Second quarter operating margin was 10.6% and lower than the 11% we expected because Communication Systems margin lagged again at 8.1%. I'll explain this all [ through ] Communication Systems margin when I review the 2018 guidance update in a few moments. And I'll tell you that we -- despite those softer margins, we have maintained our 2018 consolidated margin guidance of 11.2%. 
Segment margins for Electronics, Aerospace and Sensors were in line or better than our full year estimates. Sensor Systems margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% as expected primarily due to higher R&D spending, which we planned for, and that was $17 million. In fact, we accelerate R&D spending in the second quarter to take advantage of certain new business opportunities in that segment. Free cash flow was $165 million for the second quarter. 
And now moving to our 2018 guidance update. We increased adjusted EPS by $0.40 or 4% at the midpoint to $9.90 due to higher sales and operating income as well as lower interest expense and taxes. Excluding the 2017 tax reform onetime gain of $0.99, EPS will grow 17% compared to last year.
We increased our sales guidance midpoint by $150 million to $10.1 billion, and we expect sales to grow 6% over 2017. 
We continue to expect total segment operating margin of 11.2% for 2018, and that will expand 40 basis points over 2017. And combined with our sales growth, we expect segment operating income to increase 10% year-over-year.
We revised our 2018 segment margin guidance midpoints to 14% for Electronics, which is up 30 basis points, 12.5% for Sensors, up 70 basis points, 8% for Aerospace, which is up 10 basis points, and 10% for Communications, which is down 100 basis points. 
We reduced margin guidance for Communication Systems for 2 items. First, production orders for broadband communications have remained sluggish, causing us to lower those sales for 2018. Second, at the traveling wave tube businesses in the space and power sector, while we completed the consolidation of those businesses in April, their return to normal manufacturing productivity and yields is happening at a slower pace than we planned. 
Below the operating income line, we lowered interest expense for the savings from our recent debt refinancing, and we also lowered the estimated tax rate. We increased estimated free cash flow for the year to $915 million. 
Regarding capital allocation, Chris covered the recent acquisitions and share repurchase activity. So I'll add that with respect to share repurchases, since our year-to-date July, repurchases are $321 million, which is above our previous plan of $300 million. We could repurchase up to $400 million for this year, depending on acquisition activity, and there are a few other deals that we're presently looking at. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of the Vertex businesses on June 29, and the final net proceeds after paying taxes on the gain of that sale should be about $430 million. 
Also, with respect to our recent debt refinancings, they'll reduce our annual interest expense by $15 million. We incurred $69 million of debt retirement charges totaling $0.66 per share. And since the debt retirements straddled June and July, $48 million of those charges were recorded at the second quarter, and the remaining $21 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Taking a quick look at our third quarter. We expect sales of at least $2.5 billion, operating margin of about 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.40, which excludes the third quarter debt retirement charge of $0.20.
Finally, to conclude my financial review, we had very solid orders, sales and EPS growth in the second quarter. We're investing more in R&D. We raised guidance for the full year. We are allocating capital to grow to increase shareholder value, and we have ample resources and liquidity to support our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

As you know, I'm pretty excited about our commercial pilot training program. We've made a couple of acquisitions in the last few years to really provide, I think, the only company with a full solution set. We have the cadet training program where we bring in 1,600 cadets a year for about an 18-month program where they come in having never flown an airplane and leaving flying for a commercial airline. We have the simulators that we sell, but we're seeing more and more with the airline, the desire for them to outsource and use our schoolhouses, if you will. And I announced at the Farnborough Airshow our $100 million investment in Gatwick, where we're going to have the ability to run 24/7 8 full flight simulators, adjoined to the property where we'll be able to also build that. So we're quite optimistic. There's clearly a shortage, at least 30,000 pilots per year by all forecasts. And that's driven both from retirements and then the increase in aircraft. So I'll turn it over to Ralph to give you some numbers that we're looking at.

Although a few weeks ago, Marc Parent and I had a call, and we agreed to team on an opportunity. So maybe a somewhat unusual, but we are going to go after a commercial airline together because our combined capabilities is what the customer needed. I think of FlightSafety as more general aviation and not really in the same market as we are, although maybe we compete on the military side. So there's more than enough players. I think there's 7 or 8 that are somewhat well recognized. Our goal is to be #1 or 2 in every market that we embark in, and we're going to aggressively grow organically, make acquisitions, partner and team. And I think a lot of the airlines that we've had discussions with may be interested in just unloading their assets, their simulators and the responsibilities to a company like L3, and we may be in a position to take those over. So we're going to go very aggressive. And highly confident we'll be quite successful."

And that's why our theme is integration and growth, I get it, it's 2 things at once. I think a perfect example, this quarter with Sensors in particular but the corporation in total, we accelerated our R&D, and I think it was about $17 million in Sensors. Again, they grew 22%. And I'll say what I've said every quarter, I have absolutely no problem spending money in the near term, whether it's R&D, whether it's severance, whether it's restructuring, taking charges, spending the money for the long-term growth of this company and understanding the complications of doing that. I think we balanced it pretty well. And the more you grow, the more volume you have, in theory the higher your margins get to absorb a lot of your fixed costs. So we've got a pretty sophisticated model we look at. We're highly confident in the 12% in '19, and we plan to grow organically and inorganically.

So regarding the seasonality of our free cash flow, historically the second half has been higher in terms of free cash flow, particularly the fourth quarter. And that is going to continue -- or it's happening again this year. And I'll also add that when you look at the businesses that we divested over the last couple of years, which are all service-oriented, their cash flow cadence is more even or straight line, whereas the seasonality is more pronounced in the hardware businesses, and those are the ones that remain at L3. With respect to the second quarter itself, we did have some rather meaningful sales happen toward the end of June. For example, in Aerospace Systems, we had taken a conservative position with the [ EC 37 B] or Compass Call [ repack, ] and we ended up booking the second aircraft procurement and taking it to sales toward the end of that month. So there's about $40 million that's sitting in receivables just from that item. And then we've also had some very large shipments of night vision equipment into the Middle East toward the end of June, and that accounts for another $15 million to $20 million of bills and working capital that's going to liquidate, or be collected in the second half of this year."

We've had similar meetings with the leadership of the other services. So I think L3 is uniquely positioned to try to keep up and move quickly with our customers, and they're actually doing what they're saying, which I think is quite exciting. On the ground combat vehicles within our Electronics segment, we do have combat propulsion systems up in Michigan. They do a lot with the engines here in the U.S. and internationally, and that business has been growing. So I think we have a play there that we're working on. And of course, the sensors on various vehicles we're working with and looking for opportunities to have our sensors, including some of the WESCAM [ balls ] which have historically been airborne platforms. We've invested some R&D to have those, not only be maritime, but ground vehicle as well. So it's an opportunity we're looking at and seeing how we can get more of the pie."

So if you could walk me through that, and I don't know if it's possible to size that business so we could sort of understand where it's gone this year versus last.

So with respect to top line, I explained, as we lowered the estimated sales by $100 million for the year, and that is in the broadband communications sector. On the last earnings conference call, where I talked about where sales were trending by segment, I did explain that we were trending to a low end of sales for Communication Systems segment. I also had explained that the pickup in sales that we were anticipating was contingent on booking certain orders later on in the year. So I said today that the production order volume has remained sluggish. And as Chris explained, we are seeing some nice wins, which is mostly development work for next-gen communication type work. So the business in broadband communications is transitioning to more development cost type work versus fixed price reduction work, and that definitely weighs on the operating margins. 
So with respect to the reduction in the Comm Systems margins of 100 basis points this year, I said that the main item or the first item was that lower sales volume. In broadband communication systems, that's probably 2/3 of the reduction in operating income and margin in that segment guidance, and that's a business that will be about 1.2 billion sales this year. So those sales have been declining about 8% year-over-year. The other item impacting the margins is the Traveling Wave Tube or TWT businesses. And you recall that those are 2 businesses that we consolidate over the last year and a half plus. We completed the consolidation in April, and I said that we're not yet experiencing what we would consider to be normal manufacturing yields of productivity on those traveling wave tubes. We're going to get there beginning in the second half of this year, and we started to see some improvement in June. I'll also tell you that in terms of manufacturing complexity, Traveling-Wave Tubes is among the most complex type of manufacturing that we do, it entails a lot of calibration and tuning activity. And those skill sets we had to rebuild with new employees and train those new employees, so it's taken us a little longer than we thought to get there on the operating margins."

I mean, the desire for at least the military customers to have situational awareness and -- is critical to the national defense strategy. So it's not surprising that these capabilities are in high demand. We've been investing",277,"Yes. That's a great question. I mean, the desire for at least the military customers to have situational awareness and -- is critical to the national defense strategy. So it's not surprising that these capabilities are in high demand. We've been investing on several fronts to move these products forward, both on less power, less weight and better capability. And L3, I understand it's hard to think about just having 1 franchise program that we could put on the cover of our annual report. But I think our ISR capabilities are the best in the world. And when I look at the capabilities we have at Aerospace and the enabling technologies within Sensors and Communications, it's how do we put these things better together to go to market. So we just met earlier this week to review the R&D plan for Sensors and the corporation, and I expect it to maintain the current pace. And when we can get these types of quick results, it's a no-brainer. I think in the Electronics, we're doing a fair amount in the classified arena. And also on the Commercial side, we're going to try to grow the -- or double the commercial aviation new business that we set up, which includes the avionics and the training. We've been investing in new simulators, as you know. And the Security & Detection, one of my favorite products, the ClearScan detector is starting to get traction in Europe. Hopefully, it will get traction in the U.S. And as we all travel to airports, hopefully you'll see more L3 systems in these airports to get you to your flights quicker and safer than before."

No, thanks for that, Jon. I mean, we do monitor these acquisitions. A couple of weeks ago, we were looking at the 2016 acquisitions, and they are effectively a little over 9x EBITDA multiple this year relative to what we paid for them in '16. The '17 stuff is still too early to evaluate. We did get some good interesting acquisitions this quarter. And again, a lot of these are built on relationships. I think at least 3 to 4, we've known the companies and the owners for years, and we've worked with them, supported them. And at the right time, we enter these deals. So we try not to get into these auctions and bidding wars. I mean, obviously, we work with the bankers on an as-needed basis. But a lot of these, as we talked about, want to be part of L3. We have success stories, they come in, they meet other entrepreneurs that we've acquired that are still with us. And it's that same theme that we have talked about for years is that it's the balance of maintaining that entrepreneurial spirit with the scale of a major corporation. And that's our secret sauce. I think we're doing that well. Consolidation as a division is in no way impacts that. And we said we do easily -- we could do up to $1 billion a year in M&A and still keep our investment ratings -- investment credit ratings. So there's no walking back from there, and there's really no limitation on the sizes. We take what's available. I said before, I'd rather do $200 million and $500 million. But if they're not out there, we'll continue to do the $69 million ones, the $200 million ones and whatever's available. So we've got a great process, a good pipeline. And like I said, I think we'll announce another one probably within a month maybe in the $100 million range, and we've got a couple others we're looking at. And some will close and some won't. But clearly, accretive deals is our preference unless it's a technology buy that accelerates our R&D effort for the long term. So I hope that helps, Jon."

But I like it. We'll work that into our branding and marketing. We are all sitting around in jeans and T-shirts today, so maybe we are making progress after all. We historically had 3% of our revenue in R&D. I think we've taken it up a notch. Again, we're doing a better job aligning with where our customers are spending their money. They've laid out a national security and a national defense strategy, which is helpful. And again, the situational awareness, whether it's on the ISR front and the movement to business jets where we invested in miniaturizing some of our capabilities. It's all about lethality, speed to market, interconnectivity. The Comm segment, which we talked about a little bit, and none of us are happy where we are, but one of the top priorities around the world is the connectivity. These fourth gen and fifth gen aircraft, and like I said before, they need to be able to communicate and pass data in a contested environment. It's well documented that, that is lagging, and we'll continue to invest in those capabilities. And I'm excited about the opportunity to get those requirements into the procurement process. So we are doing a couple of things differently. We have these innovation sprints. I think last I looked, we were up to 35 so far this year, where we have a week, we put people together and try to solve a problem in a week. And we're getting more bang for the buck, spending less R&D by setting these targets and goals. And you can learn a lot in a week if you get 5, 7, 10 men and women in a room with a set problem, a set budget and it's been pretty exciting. So autonomy is big. Secured comms is big. What we've been doing in UUVs, maybe UAVs, supporting small [ fab ] payloads, those types of things is where we're spending our money."

We have about $10 billion revenue top line company right now. Aspirationally, we want to get larger. But historically, a few years ago, we thought the minimum was closer to 200, but that was really as we looked at how to start combining the divisions. Clearly, in this industry, a little larger is better. So the 500 number doesn't strike me as being unreasonable. You get the scale to optimize the systems. But again, as we're looking these things more from a top-down than a bottoms-up perspective, it's really the production, the manufacturing, the innovation that needs to reside in the divisions and sector. I think 500 is a good number. As far as upcoming awards, Ralph, trying to think which ones we highlight. C-130 [ AMP ] is a big one, but that's probably late fourth quarter, early '19.
