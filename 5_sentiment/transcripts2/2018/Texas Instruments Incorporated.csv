Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.",1318,"Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 6 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. 
You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 1 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you will join me in congratulating them both. 
Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact the December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. Corporate Law because it enables U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. 
Regarding the financial implications, there's 3 important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports and having manufacturing R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact which we provide at the start of each year. 
Second, for 2018 investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehends the long-term rate of 18% that I just described plus 5 percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly noncash. To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we are assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018, split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our website under Financial Summary Data as we've done in the past. 
Lastly, in fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax assets is noncash. The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over 8 years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first 5 years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eighth year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes. Of course, our initial estimates for the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform. With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined while personal electronics grew mid-single digits but results varied by customer. 
In our core business, Analog revenue grew 11% and Embedded Processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34, including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was $4.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. 
We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to Power and Signal Chain. High-volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue grew 20% from year ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which were Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties which began on the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded each grew about 16% on broad-based growth and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue. 
Let me describe our -- next, our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into 6 categories: Industrial; Automotive; Personal Electronics, and that will include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs; Comms Equipment; Enterprise Systems; and everything else which is primarily calculators. 
Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017. Specifically, Industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up 2 percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19%, up 1 point. Personal electronics was 25%, down 1 point. Comms Equipment and other were 12% and 3%, respectively, down 1 percentage point. While enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017. 
We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and the longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue, up from 42% just 4 years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and we continue to make improvements. 
Rafael will now review the profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. O",764,"Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million. Operating expenses on a trailing 12 month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is a noncash expense. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 due to amortization of intangibles. There will be declines of about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.56 billion or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9%, up from 43.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.3%, up from 28.8% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year-ago quarter that will not repeat or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax related expenses not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt and 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134, up 8 days from a year ago and within our expected range. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion, up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. And will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. 
Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance, from topline growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we are -- we would be upper -- I'd say upper single-digit growth overall. So I think if you look inside of that, we continue to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that of course is that both of those markets, we think, will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in Comms Equipment. That's a market that traditionally is choppy. And then in PE, it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customers overall. But again I -- with the double-digit growth in the quarter and 12% growth per year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on?"

But it also includes things like medical and healthcare, avionics to appliances and those types of things. Perhaps the financial community wouldn't put it inside of Industrial pick but behaves much in the same way. So that's why they're in there. So we are really pleased with that growth.

And that strengthened another competitive advantage which is the channel advantages. So we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3%. And we are going to continue focusing our investments on that. On the second part of your question on tax reform -- and by the way, on that, let me step back for a second. Dave said during the call that it's a great thing. We are very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, a U.S. based company, to compete more effectively in a global basis. Now we're on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great. But our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We are going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before.

So let me step back and tell you how we think about our inventory overall. We want to maintain high levels of customer service. We want to minimize obsolescence, optimize our manufacturing utilization and all these things vary depending on multiple factors. So for example, our consignment. We have many consignment engagements. As a matter of fact, we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get -- we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement. So all of that is good stuff. Also, step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on Industrial, Automotive where are -- we design a part in industrial and that part we sell for 10, 20, even 30 years. So the inventory is good for a long, long time. So we don't have to worry about this obsolescent risk and may be in the past we have other types of focus that we had. So in this particular case in the fourth quarter, we -- our inventory days ended up 134, that's within our range. And we had a chance to replenish some of our low-volume higher mix of stock. So we are going to -- we did some of that. In fact we are going to continue doing that because over the long haul as we replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those Industrial and Automotive customers and be able to keep those high levels of customer service."

So I -- and by the way, those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years. So from a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to build them, keep them in storage. And that way you're building in batches and that's just more efficient that way.

You know it for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned, guess what, $4.7 billion. So we are committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buybacks. This year, dividends were $2.1 billion. Buybacks, $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that.

So -- and frankly, at the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffer. So the bigger point is why we have the buffers, right? We are -- we are focusing on end markets. But industrial is the best example where you have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany, small customers focus on 14 sectors, hundreds of equipment. You couldn't possibly build-to-order that stuff, right? Because if there's any one customer may order a few thousand pieces. So what you do is to build in bigger batches and you store it and then you sell it over time. And because the parts -- just look at inventory the last 10 years, and it's very affordable.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.",1314,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 6, that's 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. 
You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 1 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll join me in congratulating them both. 
Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact the December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. Corporate Law because it enables U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. 
Regarding the financial implications, there's 3 important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports in having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact, which we provide at the start of each year. 
Second, for 2018, investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehend the long-term rate of 18% that I just described, plus 5 percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly noncash. To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we're assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018, split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third, and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data, as we've done in the past. 
Lastly, in fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax asset is noncash. The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over 8 years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first 5 years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eighth year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes. 
Of course, our initial estimates of the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform. With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined, while Personal Electronics grew mid-single digits, but results varied by customer. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 11% and Embedded Processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34, including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.  We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
I will now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to Power and Signal Chain. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue grew 20% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which are Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC, and the move of royalties which began in the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded each grew about 16% on broad-based growth, and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue. 
Let me describe our -- next, our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, and that will include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs; comms equipment; enterprise systems; and everything else, which is primarily calculators. 
Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017. Specifically, Industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up 2 percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19%, up 1 point. Personal electronics was 25%, down 1 point. Comms equipment and other were 12% and 3%, respectively, down 1 percentage point. While enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017. 
We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content, and these markets provide diversity and longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high-terminal value of our portfolio. 
In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue, up from 42% just 4 years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and we continue to make improvements. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points.",764,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million. Operating expenses on a trailing 12-month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is a noncash expense. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter, through the third quarter of 2019, due to amortization of intangibles. That will decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.56 billion or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9%, up from 43.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.3%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year-ago quarter that will not repeat -- or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax-related expenses, not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt in 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134, up 8 days from a year ago and within our expected range. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion, up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. And will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. 
Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing; and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Vivek, I'd first just take a look at the results in total. If you look at the quarter, fourth quarter came in with 10% year-on-year growth.

And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we're -- we'd be at mid to upper -- I'd say upper single-digit growth, overall. So I think if you look inside of that, we continue to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that, of course, is that both of those markets, we think, will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in comms equipment. That's a market that, traditionally, is choppy. And then in PE, it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customers overall. But again, I -- with double-digit growth in the quarter and a 12% growth per year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on?"

But it also includes things like medical and health care, avionics, appliances and those types of things. Perhaps the financial community wouldn't put it inside of industrial but behaves much in the same way, so that's why they're in there. So we're really pleased with that growth.

In this case, the breadth of portfolio, of course. In the case of SG&A, there are a lot of things there. But one thing that we've been focusing on is the main creation. And that strengthened another competitive advantage, which is the channel advantages. So we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3%, and we're going to continue focusing our investments on that. On the second part of your question on tax reform -- and by the way, on that, let me step back for a second. Dave said during the call that it's a great thing. We're very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, a U.S.-based company, to compete more effectively on a global basis. Now we're on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great. But our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We're going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before.

So all of that is good stuff. Also, step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on industrial, automotive where are -- we design a part in industrial, and that part may sell for 10, 20, even 30 years. So the inventory is good for a long, long time. So we don't have to worry about this obsolescent risk that maybe in the past we have other types of focus that we had. So in this particular case, in the fourth quarter, we -- our inventory days ended up 134, that's within our range. And we had a chance to replenish some of our low volume, high mix of stock. So we're going to -- we did some of that. In fact, we're going to continue doing that because over the long haul, as we replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those industrial and automotive customers, and be able to keep those high levels of customer service."

So -- and by the way, those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves, and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years.

We have -- we don't have concentrated maturities and we maintained strategic flexibility. On the first part of your question, our commitment to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. You know this for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year, for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned, guess what, $4.7 billion. So we're committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buybacks. This year, dividends were $2.1 billion; buybacks, $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that.

So -- and frankly, at the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffer. So the bigger point is why we have the buffers, right? We -- we're focusing end markets such as -- industrial is the best example where you have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany. Small customers focused on 14 sectors, hundreds of equipment. You couldn't possibly build-to-order that stuff, right? Because there's any one customer may order a few thousand pieces. So what you do is you build in bigger batches, you store it and then you sell it over time. And because the parts -- just in our inventory the last 10 years, then it's very affordable. It makes a lot of sense to do that. And we do that with very low levels of scrap in any one quarter and any one year."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.",1314,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 6, that's 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. 
You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 1 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll join me in congratulating them both. 
Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact the December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. Corporate Law because it enables U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. 
Regarding the financial implications, there's 3 important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports in having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact, which we provide at the start of each year. 
Second, for 2018, investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehends the long-term rate of 18% that I just described, plus 5 percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly noncash. To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we're assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018, split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third, and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data, as we've done in the past. 
Lastly, in fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax asset is noncash. The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over 8 years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first 5 years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eighth year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes. 
Of course, our initial estimates of the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform. With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined, while Personal Electronics grew mid-single digits, but results varied by customer. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 11% and Embedded Processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34, including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.  We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
I will now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to Power and Signal Chain. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue grew 20% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which are Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC, and the move of royalties which began in the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded each grew about 16% on broad-based growth, and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue. 
Let me describe our -- next, our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, and that will include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs; comms equipment; enterprise systems; and everything else, which is primarily calculators. 
Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017. Specifically, Industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up 2 percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19%, up 1 point. Personal electronics was 25%, down 1 point. Comms equipment and other were 12% and 3%, respectively, down 1 percentage point. While enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017. 
We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content, and these markets provide diversity and longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high-terminal value of our portfolio. 
In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue, up from 42% just 4 years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and we continue to make improvements. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points.",765,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million. Operating expenses on a trailing 12-month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is a noncash expense. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter, through the third quarter of 2019, due to amortization of intangibles. That will decline to about $50 million per quarter for the 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.56 billion or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9%, up from 43.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.3%, up from 28.8% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year-ago quarter that will not repeat -- or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax-related expenses, not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt in 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134, up 8 days from a year ago and within our expected range. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion, up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. And will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. 
Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing; and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

When I look at your Q1 sales outlook, it's in line with consensus, seasonally somewhat conservative. After seasonally below -- well, below seasonal quarter you had in Q4. And Dave, it seems to me in somewhat contrast to the very strong macro environment. So is there something that you're seeing that is keeping you more conservative than usual?"

Vivek, I'd first just take a look at the results in total. If you look at the quarter, fourth quarter came in with 10% year-on-year growth.

And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we're -- we'd be at mid to upper -- I'd say upper single-digit growth, overall. So I think if you look inside of that, we continue to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that, of course, is that both of those markets, we think, will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in comms equipment. That's a market that, traditionally, is choppy. And then in PE, it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customers overall. But again, I -- with double-digit growth in the quarter and a 12% growth per year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on?"

And then on top of that, we've been gaining share in Analog and Embedded on a pretty consistent basis. So you can think of another point or 2 on top of that for our long-term sustainable growth. Of course, any one quarter, even any one year, that can vary.

But it also includes things like medical and health care, avionics, appliances and those types of things. Perhaps the financial community wouldn't put it inside of industrial but behaves much in the same way, so that's why they're in there. So we're really pleased with that growth.

In this case, the breadth of portfolio, of course. In the case of SG&A, there are a lot of things there. But one thing that we've been focusing on is the main creation. And that strengthened another competitive advantage, which is the channel advantages. So we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3%, and we're going to continue focusing our investments on that. On the second part of your question on tax reform -- and by the way, on that, let me step back for a second. Dave said during the call that it's a great thing. We're very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, a U.S.-based company, to compete more effectively on a global basis. Now we're on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great. But our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We're going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before. And now with more cash, we're going to do that and then we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, which is our commitment as part of our competitive advantage -- I'm sorry, our capital management strategy that we have been talking about for a number of years."

We have many consignment engagements. In fact, we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get -- we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement. So all of that is good stuff. Also, step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on industrial, automotive where are -- we design a part in industrial, and that part may sell for 10, 20, even 30 years. So the inventory is good for a long, long time. So we don't have to worry about this obsolescent risk that maybe in the past we had with other types of focus that we had. So in this particular case, in the fourth quarter, we -- our inventory days ended up 134, that's within our range. And we had a chance to replenish some of our low volume, high mix of stock. So we're going to -- we did some of that. In fact, we're going to continue doing that because over the long haul, as we replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those industrial and automotive customers, and be able to keep those high levels of customer service."

But I would tell you that, as I mentioned to the earlier caller, we want to have buffers of inventory, particularly when addressing the industrial market, but also the automotive market. It's a good thing to have these buffers. And we have many -- many of our products are low volume, high mix. So -- and by the way, those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves, and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years. So from a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to build them, keep them in storage. And the way you build them in batches, then it's just about more efficient that way.

We have -- we don't have concentrated maturities and we maintain a strategic flexibility. On the first part of your question, our commitment to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. You know this for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year, for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned, guess what, $4.7 billion. So we're committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buybacks. This year, dividends were $2.1 billion; buybacks, $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that.

So -- and frankly, at the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffer. So the bigger point is why we have the buffers, right? We -- we're focusing end markets such as -- industrial is the best example where you have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany. Small customers focused on 14 sectors, hundreds of equipment. You couldn't possibly build-to-order that stuff, right? Because there's any one customer may order a few thousand pieces. So what you do is you build in bigger batches, you store it and then you sell it over time. And because the parts -- just in our inventory the last 10 years, then it's very affordable. It makes a lot of sense to do that. And we do that with very low levels of scrap in any one quarter and any one year."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.",1314,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 6, that's 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. 
You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 1 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll join me in congratulating them both. 
Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact the December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. Corporate Law because it enables U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. 
Regarding the financial implications, there's 3 important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports in having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact, which we provide at the start of each year. 
Second, for 2018, investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehends the long-term rate of 18% that I just described, plus 5 percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly noncash. To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we're assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018, split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third, and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data, as we've done in the past. 
Lastly, in fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax asset is noncash. The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over 8 years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first 5 years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eighth year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes. 
Of course, our initial estimates of the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform. With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S.-headquartered companies, like TI, to compete more effectively on a global basis. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined, while Personal Electronics grew mid-single digits, but results varied by customer. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 11% and Embedded Processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34, including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
I will now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to Power and Signal Chain. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue grew 20% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which are Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC, and the move of royalties which began in the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded each grew about 16% on broad-based growth, and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue. 
Let me describe our -- next, our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, and that will include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs; comms equipment; enterprise systems; and everything else, which is primarily calculators. 
Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017. Specifically, Industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up 2 percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19%, up 1 point. Personal electronics was 25%, down 1 point. Comms equipment and other were 12% and 3%, respectively, down 1 percentage point. While enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017. 
We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content, and these markets provide diversity and longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high-terminal value of our portfolio. 
In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue, up from 42% just 4 years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and we continue to make improvements. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points.",765,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million. Operating expenses on a trailing 12-month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is a noncash expense. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter, through the third quarter of 2019, due to amortization of intangibles. That will decline to about $50 million per quarter for the 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.56 billion or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9%, up from 43.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.3%, up from 28.8% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year-ago quarter that will not repeat -- or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax-related expenses, not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt in 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134, up 8 days from a year ago and within our expected range. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion, up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. And will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. 
Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing; and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we're -- we'd be at mid to upper -- I'd say upper single-digit growth, overall. So I think if you look inside of that, we continue to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that, of course, is that both of those markets, we think, will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in comms equipment. That's a market that, traditionally, is choppy. And then in PE, it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customers overall. But again, I -- with double-digit growth in the quarter and a 12% growth per year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on?"

But it also includes things like medical and health care, avionics, appliances and those types of things. Perhaps the financial community wouldn't put it inside of industrial but behaves much in the same way, so that's why they're in there. So we're really pleased with that growth.

And that strengthened another competitive advantage, which is the channel advantages. So we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3%, and we're going to continue focusing our investments on that. On the second part of your question on tax reform -- and by the way, on that, let me step back for a second. Dave said during the call that it's a great thing. We're very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, a U.S.-based company, to compete more effectively on a global basis. Now we're on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great. But our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We're going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before.

We want to minimize obsolescence, optimize our manufacturing utilization and all these things vary depending on multiple factors. So for example, our consignment. We have many consignment engagements. In fact, we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get -- we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement. So all of that is good stuff. Also, step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on industrial, automotive where are -- we design a part in industrial, and that part may sell for 10, 20, even 30 years. So the inventory is good for a long, long time. So we don't have to worry about this obsolescent risk that maybe in the past we had with other types of focus that we had. So in this particular case, in the fourth quarter, we -- our inventory days ended up 134, that's within our range. And we had a chance to replenish some of our low volume, high mix of stock. So we're going to -- we did some of that. In fact, we're going to continue doing that because over the long haul, as we replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those industrial and automotive customers, and be able to keep those high levels of customer service."

In -- on the second part of your question, of course, we don't get into that level of detail. But I would tell you that, as I mentioned to the earlier caller, we want to have buffers of inventory, particularly when addressing the industrial market, but also the automotive market. It's a good thing to have these buffers. And we have many -- many of our products are low volume, high mix. So -- and by the way, those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves, and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years. So from a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to build them, keep them in storage. And the way you build them in batches, then it's just about more efficient that way.

We have -- we don't have concentrated maturities and we maintain a strategic flexibility. On the first part of your question, our commitment to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. You know this for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year, for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned, guess what, $4.7 billion. So we're committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buybacks. This year, dividends were $2.1 billion; buybacks, $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that.

So -- and frankly, at the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffer. So the bigger point is why we have the buffers, right? We -- we're focusing end markets such as -- industrial is the best example where you have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany. Small customers focused on 14 sectors, hundreds of equipment. You couldn't possibly build-to-order that stuff, right? Because there's any one customer may order a few thousand pieces. So what you do is you build in bigger batches, you store it and then you sell it over time. And because the parts -- just in our inventory the last 10 years, then it's very affordable. It makes a lot of sense to do that. And we do that with very low levels of scrap in any one quarter and any one year."

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is bei",812,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core business, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law. With that, backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue grew by 15% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectations of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional noncash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete items. It gets you to an effective tax rate by quarter. For the balance of the year, we'll continue -- we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data, as we've done in the past. 
And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018. 
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were [ $819 million ] a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4% and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. 
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.55 billion or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion or $1.35 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 17% from a year ago. In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remained strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing and the best market, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We talked about this during our capital management strategy during a couple of months ago. And CapEx is -- our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth. We want to expand our low-cost manufacturing advantage, specifically the 300-millimeter. We're the only analog company with its own 300-millimeter factory. and what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow for share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is, the CapEx percent of revenue, that's just a general guide that we give. And on that, our spend is that -- that 4% -- that could vary, depending on what's going on in the marketplace. In a period of very strong demand, when we're expanding capacity, that could run up. And right now, on a trailing 12-month basis, it's 4.9%. But of course, the reason that would run up is that we see opportunity to continue expanding our technology development and our low-cost manufacturing advantage so that ultimately we drive long-term growth of our free cash flow per share."

I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where inventory ended up.

I would say that we've got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also, you very quickly point out, that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think with that said, I think it's always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility in the distribution inventories. As I talked about earlier, a good portion of that remains on consignment, so we'll actually hold that inventory in our books. Our visibility into customer inventory is very -- really depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs, we're carrying that inventory on our books. And we're not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals, things like expedites and things like that would suggest that there be some other broader issue. Now our visibility into inventory beyond our customers' manufacturing operations, of course, is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hotspots. We work aggressively with customers to close. And other metrics, like cancellations, reschedules, those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time, we'll just try to keep doing what we've been doing, which is with our manufacturing and our internal inventory strategies, we just stay focused on keeping lead time stable.

From a cash return standpoint, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have b",258,"Yes. So let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, and we've returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we're doing that. Now obviously, we do that 2 ways, dividends or repurchase. From a dividend standpoint, we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year, we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis, for the last -- for the previous 5 years. And in the end of last year, also the trailing 12-month basis, that 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores its sustainability. On the repurchases, we just got down repurchasing $873 million of our own stock, and our objective there is accretive capture of the future free cash flow for the long-term owners of the company. So we use retail assumptions to extrapolate, estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be. And then based on that, we come up with different scenarios and validation. And as long as the market price is below those scenarios, we buy back stock. And that's what you've seen us do for a number of years now, and we will continue doing that."

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remain strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core business, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue grew by 15% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectations of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional noncash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete items, it gets you to an effective tax rate by quarter. For the balance of the year, we'll continue -- we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data, as we've done in the past.
And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.55 billion or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion or $1.35 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 17% from a year ago. In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remained strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages. We have manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

I would say that we've got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also, I'd very quickly point out, that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think with that said, I think it's always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility in the distribution inventories. As I talked about earlier, a good portion of that remains on consignment, so we'll actually hold that inventory in our books. Our visibility into customer inventory is very -- this really depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs, we're carrying that inventory on our books. And we're not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals, things like expedites and things like that would suggest that there'd be some other broader issue. Now our visibility in the inventory beyond our customers' manufacturing operations, of course, is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hotspots. We work aggressively with customers to close. And other metrics, like cancellations, reschedules, those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time, we'll just try to keep doing what we've been doing, which is with our manufacturing and our internal inventory strategies, we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable.

So let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, and we've returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we're doing that. Now obviously, we do that in 2 ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint, we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year, we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis, for the last -- for the previous 5 years. And we ended last year, also on a trailing 12-month basis, that 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores its sustainability. On the repurchases, we just got down repurchasing $873 million of our own stock, and our objective there is the accretive capture of the future free cash flow for the long-term owners of the company. So we use reasonable assumptions to extrapolate, estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be. And then based on that, we come up with different scenarios and validation. And as long as the market price is below those scenarios, we buy back stock. And that's what you've seen us do for a number of years now, and we will continue doing that."

This call is bei",812,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remains strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core business, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue grew by 15% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectations of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional noncash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete items, it gets you to an effective tax rate by quarter. For the balance of the year, we'll continue -- we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data as we've done in the past.
And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $818 million, a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4% and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.55 billion or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion or $1.35 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 17% from a year ago. In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We talked about this during our capital management strategy a couple of months ago. And CapEx is -- our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth. We want to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, specifically 300-millimeter. We're the only analog company with its own 300-millimeter factory. And what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is, the CapEx percent of revenue, that's just a general guide that we give. And on that, our sense is that, that 4%, that could vary depending on what's going on in the marketplace. In a period of very strong demand when we're expanding capacity, that could run up. And right now, on a trailing 12-month basis, it's 4.9%. But of course, the reason that would run up is that we see opportunities to continue expanding our technology development and our low-cost manufacturing advantage so that, ultimately, we drive long-term growth of free cash flow per share."

The objective of inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, improve our manufacturing asset utilization. And we also see value in controlling that inventory, having more of it in our own product distribution centers, more in consignment, more in low-volume buffers. I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where our inventory ended up. From a days basis, it was 136 days. From a year ago, that's up 4 days. Sequentially, it's up 2 days. And it's well within our 115 to 145-day inventory days range."

I would say that we've got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also. I'd very quickly point out, that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think with that said, I think it's always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility into distribution inventories that I talked about earlier. A good portion of that remains on consignment, so we'll actually hold that inventory in our books. Our visibility into customer inventory varies. Really it depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs, we're carrying that inventory on our books. And we're not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals, things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there'd be some other broader issue. Now our visibility into inventory beyond our customers' manufacturing operations, of course, is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hotspots. We work aggressively with customers to close. And other metrics like cancellations, reschedules, those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time, we'll just try to keep doing what we've been doing, which is, with our manufacturing and our internal inventory strategies, we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable.

So let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, and we've returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we're doing that. Now obviously, we do that in 2 ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint, we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year, we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis for the last -- for the previous 5 years. In the end of last year, also on a trailing 12-month basis, that's 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores its sustainability. On the repurchases, we just got done repurchasing $873 million of our own stock, and our objective there is the accretive capture of the future free cash flow for the long-term owners of the company. So we use reasonable assumptions to extrapolate, estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be. And then based on that, we come up with different scenarios and valuation. And as long as the market price is below those scenarios, we buy back the stock. And that's what you've seen us do for a number of years now, and we will continue doing that."

And I would just say that, of course, that was driven by industrial and automotive. And I'd just say, that strength we saw very, very broadly. So there wasn't one specific thing that we would point to. And I think again that highlights one of those competitive advantages of diversity and long-lived positions that we can see that kind of strength, and it comes through and shows up even on the top line.

Now that doesn't mean that we would be immune from a correction. I think a correction would -- short term or even medium term, would affect all the sectors. But the important point is that, longer term, this is the place where we want to be because this is -- in both of those end markets, automotive and industrial, that's where the content is growing. So even if there's -- or when there is a correction and we go through that, the end point down the road, 10, 15, 20 years from now, is still the same, which is more and more content in those end markets."

This call is bei",812,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remains strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core business, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue grew by 15% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectations of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional noncash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete items, it gets you to an effective tax rate by quarter. For the balance of the year, we'll continue -- we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data as we've done in the past.
And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $818 million, a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4% and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.55 billion or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion or $1.35 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 17% from a year ago. In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We want to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, specifically 300-millimeter. We're the only analog company with its own 300-millimeter factory. And what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is, the CapEx percent of revenue, that's just a general guide that we give. And on that, our sense is that, that 4%, that could vary depending on what's going on in the marketplace. In a period of very strong demand when we're expanding capacity, that could run up. And right now, on a trailing 12-month basis, it's 4.9%. But of course, the reason that would run up is that we see opportunities to continue expanding our technology development and our low-cost manufacturing advantage so that, ultimately, we drive long-term growth of free cash flow per share."

I'll talk about our internal inventory, and then Dave will talk about channel inventory. But on inventory, let me step back again and refer to -- refer you to our long-term objectives that we talked about at the capital management call. What do we want inventory for? The objective of inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, improve our manufacturing asset utilization. And we also see value in controlling that inventory, having more of it in our own product distribution centers, more in consignment, more in low-volume buffers. I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where our inventory ended up. From a days basis, it was 136 days. From a year ago, that's up 4 days. Sequentially, it's up 2 days. And it's well within our 115 to 145-day inventory days range."

And just as a reminder, for those that aren't familiar, as Rafael pointed out, there is -- we believe that there's value in owning and controlling our own inventory, and that shows up in the consignment programs.

I'd very quickly point out, that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think with that said, I think it's always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility into distribution inventories that I talked about earlier. A good portion of that remains on consignment, so we'll actually hold that inventory in our books. Our visibility into customer inventory varies. Really it depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs, we're carrying that inventory on our books. And we're not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals, things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there'd be some other broader issue. Now our visibility into inventory beyond our customers' manufacturing operations, of course, is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hotspots. We work aggressively with customers to close. And other metrics like cancellations, reschedules, those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time, we'll just try to keep doing what we've been doing, which is, with our manufacturing and our internal inventory strategies, we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable. And more importantly, delivery metric's very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?"

So let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, and we've returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we're doing that. Now obviously, we do that in 2 ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint, we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year, we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis for the last -- for the previous 5 years. In the end of last year, also on a trailing 12-month basis, that's 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores its sustainability. On the repurchases, we just got done repurchasing $873 million of our own stock, and our objective there is the accretive capture of the future free cash flow for the long-term owners of the company. So we use reasonable assumptions to extrapolate, estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be. And then based on that, we come up with different scenarios and valuation. And as long as the market price is below those scenarios, we buy back the stock. And that's what you've seen us do for a number of years now, and we will continue doing that."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website.
A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles of President and CEO, along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years, and under his continuing leadership, we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. 
I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks, and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and doing -- and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages and running our operations with laser focus.
Now turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses.
Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a share per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remains unchanged.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from a year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad-based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across 14 sectors in industrial and 5 sectors in automotive and continued to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low single digits, with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers.
Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low to mid-single digits sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content, and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We're pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 44.7% a year ago. 
And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter Analog revenue. 
Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 42% from a year ago. 
In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends and repurchased $1.02 billion from our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due and raised $1.5 billion of 30-year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. 
Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is a strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. 
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. 
Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. More detail on our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data. 
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That's inclusive of what happened inside of High Volume. And again, I think that that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities. If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously, industrial and automotive continued to do well. Inside of you'd see that industrial and automotive did well as well.

And as example, lead times remain stable. Cancellations remain low. Reschedules remain low. We look at inventory and the channels. That remains steady at about 4 weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint. And the other thing -- and as you pointed out, when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last 5 years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. 3 of those 5 years has been at 6%. And if you look over a 10-year period, it's 7%.

We have stated, been in that position for a long time, and we continue to do that and advocate that. Specifically, on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July. So those are not in place yet. If -- once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed as Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue's exports. So not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin would be deemed as Chinese origin. So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential, any adjustment, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. And so at the end of the day, we don't see any major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact. Now that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade, anything against free trade between the 2 largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody."

First, let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically, to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long term. So we -- the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So we have been -- and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up. And that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to -- is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories, where we invest some of that CapEx. But predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fabs and the existing factories. Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow -- on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which again drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow. Then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had tax reform, and as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of onetime tax-related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison."

And, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can. And the other important metric that we look inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got to have a stated lead time. And if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous. And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into.

So I think again, I'd refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself. And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that. So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that. So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that in general, very confident in our position. And we've got -- we're building off at a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the role as the President and CEO, along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years and, under his continuing leadership, we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and doing -- and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages and running our operations with laser focus.
Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.
With that backdrop, I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remain unchanged.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC.
Now, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad-based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across 14 sectors in industrial and 5 sectors in automotive and continued to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low to mid-single digits sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue, within our range of expectations.
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter Analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 42% from a year ago.
In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due and raised $1.5 billion of 30-year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%.
Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. More detail of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That's inclusive of what happened inside of High Volume. And again, I think that that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities.
If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously, industrial and automotive continued to do well. Inside of HVAL, you'd see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue.

And I would just say that -- if there's something specific to call out, as we have in the past, if there was a specific customer or specific end market or something like that, that was changing, we would let you know about that. And as example, lead times remained stable. Cancellations remained low. Reschedules remained low. We look at inventory and the channels. That remains steady at about 4 weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint.
And the other thing -- and as you pointed out, when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last 5 years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. Three of those 5 years has been at 6%. And if you look over a 10-year period, it's 7%.

And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue -- we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that.
Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet. If -- once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a -- would be deemed as Chinese origin. So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential -- any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact.
Now, that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade -- anything against free trade between the 2 largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody."

First, let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx.

First, let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long term. So we -- the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So we have been -- and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to -- is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories.
Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow -- on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew -- what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow. Then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a -- we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of onetime tax-related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison."

And for the vast majority of our products, they continue to remain stable. And that doesn't mean that we don't have hotspots and, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can.
And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous. And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into. So I think we just remain focused on what we can control, which is the lead times and shipping performance, customers can have confidence in getting product from us."

I think what that illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customers. And kind of to my point earlier, we look at the opportunity inside of personal electronics. Longer term, we don't see that as a significant growth engine for us, but it is a place that we continue to invest. And we really believe that the majority of the growth is really going to come from industrial and automotive. So incrementally, as we've taken up our spend, we've moved it more into those growth areas. So -- but again, we're going to have handsets and PCs and those other things for decades to come.

So I think, again, I'd refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself. And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that.
So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that.
So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got -- we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles President and CEO, along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years and, under his continuing leadership, we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and doing -- and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages and running our operations with laser focus.
Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.
With that backdrop, I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remain unchanged.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad-based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across 14 sectors in industrial and 5 sectors in automotive and continued to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low to mid-single digits sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue, within our range of expectations.
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter Analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 42% from a year ago.
In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due and raised $1.5 billion of 30-year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%.
Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. More detail of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That's inclusive of what happened inside of High Volume. And again, I think that, that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities.
If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously, industrial and automotive continued to do well. Inside of HVAL, you'd see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue.
So anyway, we're pleased with that outcome and not surprised by it. You have a follow-on, John?"

And as example, lead times remained stable. Cancellations remained low. Reschedules remained low. We look at inventory in the channels. That remains steady at about 4 weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint.
And the other thing -- and as you pointed out, when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal.

And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue -- we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that.
Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet. If -- once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a -- would be deemed as Chinese origin. So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential -- any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact.
Now that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade -- anything against free trade between the 2 largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody."

First, let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long-term. So we -- the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So we have been -- and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to -- is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories.
Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow -- on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew -- what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow. Then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a -- we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of onetime tax-related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison."

And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous. And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there?

I think what that illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customers. And kind of to my point earlier, we look at the opportunity inside of personal electronics. Longer term, we don't see that as a significant growth engine for us, but it is a place that we continue to invest. And we really believe that the majority of the growth is really going to come from industrial and automotive. So incrementally, as we've taken up our spend, we've moved it more into those growth areas. So -- but again, we're going to have handsets and PCs and those other things for decades to come. So we just find good opportunities inside of there and want to continue to invest in them.

So I think, again, I'd refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself. And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that.
So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that.
So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got -- we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments."

Yes. So before we close, I just want to make a point because it wasn't asked, but our results, among other things, demonstrate our continued discipline and execution on capital management strategy. We generated on a trailing 12-month basis $5.7 billion of free cash flow and we returned $5.6 billion of free cash flow in that time frame. So virtually all free cash flow generated was returned to the owners of the company. That was both through dividends and buybacks. In the case of dividends, on that comparison, it was 41% of free cash flow, so right between our 40% and 60% guidance, but clearly towards the lower end. So I'd just underscore the sustainability of those dividends."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles President and CEO, along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years and, under his continuing leadership, we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and doing -- and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages and running our operations with laser focus.
Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.
With that backdrop, I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remain unchanged.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad-based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across 14 sectors in industrial and 5 sectors in automotive and continued to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low to mid-single digits sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue, within our range of expectations.
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4%, up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter Analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 42% from a year ago.
In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due and raised $1.5 billion of 30-year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%.
Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. More detail of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That's inclusive of what happened inside of High Volume. And again, I think that, that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities.
If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously, industrial and automotive continued to do well. Inside of HVAL, you'd see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue.

And I would just say that -- if there's something specific to call out, as we have in the past, if there was a specific customer or specific end market or something like that, that was changing, we would let you know about that. And as example, lead times remained stable. Cancellations remained low. Reschedules remained low. We look at inventory in the channels. That remains steady at about 4 weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint.
And the other thing -- and as you pointed out, when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last 5 years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. Three of those 5 years has been at 6%. And if you look over a 10-year period, it's 7%.

And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue -- we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that.
Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet. If -- once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a -- would be deemed as Chinese origin. So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential -- any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact.
Now that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade -- anything against free trade between the 2 largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody."

First, let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long-term. So we -- the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So we have been -- and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to -- is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories.
Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow -- on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew -- what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow. Then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a -- we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of onetime tax-related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison."

And that doesn't mean that we don't have hotspots and, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can.
And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous. And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into.

So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that.
So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got -- we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments."

Yes. So before we close, I just want to make a point because it wasn't asked, but our results, among other things, demonstrate our continued discipline and execution on capital management strategy. We generated on a trailing 12-month basis $5.7 billion of free cash flow and we returned $5.6 billion of free cash flow in that time frame. So virtually all free cash flow generated was returned to the owners of the company. That was both through dividends and buybacks. In the case of dividends, on that comparison, it was 41% of free cash flow, so right between our 40% and 60% guidance, but clearly towards the lower end. So I'd just underscore the sustainability of those dividends."

This call is b",692,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago. However, demand for our product slowed across most markets during the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with Communications Equipment as the exception. In Communications Equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps while Embedded Products declined from a year ago as we expected. Without the decline in Communications Equipment, Embedded would've grown. 
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Taken together, these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners. 
I'll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontroller was about even. In our other segment, revenues declined 6%, primarily due to custom products as we expected. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper single digit growth with most sectors growing year-on-year. Automotive grew double digits from a year ago but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in Industrial and 5 sectors in Automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term. Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines at others. Communications Equipment increased low single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included the early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier, grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew. In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving our initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points.

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. 
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77 or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased our quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. 
To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data. 
In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 16 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market and we plan to execute as we have in the past. 
First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts. However, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. 
Second, we will continue to our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. 
Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A. They're important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages like our demand creation initiative and this will remain unchanged. In other area of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. 
And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon at 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300-millimeter factory shell in place. 
In conclusion, we are focused on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for the long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

Those are low risk buffers. Those parts live for a long, long time and they enable us to then support our customers on the other side of this slowdown.

So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we've been talking about how we're allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we've been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In personal electronics, no surprise there. It's down but it's more selective, it's not 0., we still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we've long talked about in Embedded that we've taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we've actually taken it down. The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what's new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don't change things much from a digital standpoint. So we've got good position there that's not -- that isn't something that we've needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we are confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we are still shipping some 3G stuff.

Let me that just comment on a few of the things that we can see. And certainly, we watch all those indicators. And to kind of start with where I want to end is the best indicator that we get are orders from customers that we get directly as well as we've got 60% of our revenues on consignment where we actually have demand [ fees ] that customers are telling us what they plan to build. And those clearly are the best signals that we can see. Our outlook will be built on that. And certainly, those indicators show that demand slowed across most of the end markets during the quarter. And that's why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it's up slightly but it's still running at about 4 weeks. Cancellations are up but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable. And it doesn't matter what period you're in, you're always going to have places where demand will be tight and we will work with customers on that. But a vast majority of products have continued to be very, very stable from a lead time standpoint. So that's kind of what we see. Regionally, I don't think when we look at our numbers, there's nothing there that we would call out specifically. And also, just as a reminder, I know you know very well that we ship product into a particular region, it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world. So actually, looking at our demand by regional results really doesn't give much color on what's going on from a macro standpoint. So you got a follow-on?"

We have more industrial, more automotive business. We are continuing to invest and ensure that that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we've continued to invest in our 300-millimeter analog footprint and grow. So we've got that going into the numbers. So -- and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we are generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue 37.5%.

One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter.

And we will likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we will do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx -- as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it's already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%. And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be 6% of $100 million over a couple of years.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is b",695,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago. However, demand for our product slowed across most markets during the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago. 
Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with Communications Equipment as the exception. In Communications Equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps while our Embedded Products declined from a year ago as we expected. Without the decline in Communications Equipment, Embedded would've grown. 
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. 
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Taken together, these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners. 
I'll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontroller was about even. In our Other segment, revenues declined 6%, primarily due to custom products as we expected. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper single digit growth, with most sectors growing year-on-year. Automotive grew double digits from a year ago but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in Industrial and 5 sectors in Automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long term. 
Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines in Others. Communications Equipment increased low single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included the early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier, grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew. 
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving our initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in",913,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. 
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. 
In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77 or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased our quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. 
To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data. 
In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 16 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market and we plan to execute as we have in the past. 
First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts. However, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. 
Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. 
Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A. They're important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages like our demand creation initiative and this will remain unchanged. In other area of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. 
And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300-millimeter factory shell in place. 
In conclusion, we are focused on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for the long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

But the key point on keeping those, the wafer starts, at a level that even though we are reducing them, but we can still build those long-lived inventory buffers for industrial and automotive. Those are low risk buffers. Those parts live for a long, long time and they enable us to then support our customers on the other side of this slowdown. So overall, it's just a better way and a smart way to allocate our capital."

So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we've been talking about how we're allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we've been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In personal electronics, no surprise there. It's down, but it's more selective, it's not 0. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we've long talked about in Embedded that we've taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we've actually taken it down. The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what's new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don't change things much from a digital standpoint. So we've got good position there that's not -- that isn't something that we've needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we're confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we're still shipping some 3G stuff. So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer term from industrial and automotive.

So all we can judge is by what we see right in front of us, what our customers, the signal they send us and that's what we are basing this on. In addition to that, as Dave said, the key thing here is what we do with the operating plan so that we put ourselves in a position so that if this is shallow, we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth. If it's not shallow, if it actually goes the other way, we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustments to just continue to do the right thing from a free cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint. On the investment side, as I said during our prepared remarks, we are not going to change anything on R&D.

And to kind of start with where I want to end is the best indicator that we get are orders from customers that we get directly as well as we've got 60% of our revenues on consignment where we actually have demand fees that customers are telling us what they plan to build. And those clearly are the best signals that we can see. Our outlook will be built on that. And certainly, those indicators show that demand slowed across most of the end markets during the quarter. And that's why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it's up slightly but it's still running at about 4 weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable. And it doesn't matter what period you're in, you're always going to have places where demand will be tight and we will work with customers on that. But the vast majority of products have continued to be very, very stable from a lead time standpoint. So that's kind of what we see. Regionally, I don't think when we look at our numbers, there's nothing there that we would call out, specifically. And also, just as a reminder, I know you know very well that we ship product into a particular region, it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world. So actually, looking at our demand by regional results really doesn't give much color on what's going on from a macro standpoint. So you got a follow-on?"

The economic growth has been stronger over the last couple of years. So that's certainly different. I think that our business has continued to evolve. We have more industrial, more automotive business. We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we've continued to invest in our 300-millimeter analog footprint and grow. So we've got that going into the numbers. So -- and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we're generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%.

So yes, to Dave's point, we have demonstrated for a number of years now the strength of the business model. And that's through ups and now, downs. And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory. And we'll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we'll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx -- as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it's already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%. And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years.

It gets some of the quarter-to-quarter transitions out of the way. That can be a little noisy. So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter -- or last year, I'm sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail.

This call is b",695,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago. However, demand for our product slowed across most markets during the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago. 
Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with Communications Equipment as the exception. In Communications Equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps while our Embedded Products declined from a year ago as we expected. Without the decline in Communications Equipment, Embedded would've grown. 
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. 
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.22 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Taken together, these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners. 
I'll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontroller was about even. In our Other segment, revenues declined 6%, primarily due to custom products as we expected. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper single digit growth, with most sectors growing year-on-year. Automotive grew double digits from a year ago but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in Industrial and 5 sectors in Automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long term. 
Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines in Others. Communications Equipment increased low single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included the early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier, grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew. 
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving our initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in",913,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. 
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. 
In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77 or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased our quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. 
To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data. 
In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 15 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market and we plan to execute as we have in the past. 
First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts. However, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. 
Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. 
Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A. They're important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages like our demand creation initiative and this will remain unchanged. In other area of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. 
And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300-millimeter factory shell in place. 
In conclusion, we are focused on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for the long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we've been talking about how we're allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we've been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In personal electronics, no surprise there. It's down, but it's more selective, it's not 0. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we've long talked about in Embedded that we've taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we've actually taken it down. The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what's new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don't change things much from a digital standpoint. So we've got good position there that's not -- that isn't something that we've needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we're confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we're still shipping some 3G stuff. So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer term from industrial and automotive.

And that's why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it's up slightly but it's still running at about 4 weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable.

We have more industrial, more automotive business. We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we've continued to invest in our 300-millimeter analog footprint and grow. So we've got that going into the numbers. So -- and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we're generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%.

And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory. And we'll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we'll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx -- as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it's already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%. And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years.

So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter -- or last year, I'm sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail.

This call is b",695,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago. However, demand for our product slowed across most markets during the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago. 
Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with Communications Equipment as the exception. In Communications Equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps while our Embedded Products declined from a year ago as we expected. Without the decline in Communications Equipment, Embedded would've grown. 
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. 
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.22 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Taken together, these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners. 
I'll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontroller was about even. In our Other segment, revenues declined 6%, primarily due to custom products as we expected. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper single digit growth, with most sectors growing year-on-year. Automotive grew double digits from a year ago but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in Industrial and 5 sectors in Automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long term. 
Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines in Others. Communications Equipment increased low single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included the early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier, grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew. 
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving our initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. 
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. 
In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77 or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased our quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to noncash charges. 
To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data. 
In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 15 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market and we plan to execute as we have in the past. 
First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts. However, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. 
Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. 
Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A. They're important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages like our demand creation initiative and this will remain unchanged. In other area of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. 
And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300-millimeter factory shell in place. 
In conclusion, we are focused on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for the long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we've been talking about how we're allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we've been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In personal electronics, no surprise there. It's down, but it's more selective, it's not 0. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we've long talked about in Embedded that we've taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we've actually taken it down. The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what's new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don't change things much from a digital standpoint. So we've got good position there that's not -- that isn't something that we've needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we're confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we're still shipping some 3G stuff. So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer term from industrial and automotive.

So all we can judge is by what we see right in front of us, what our customers, the signal they send us and that's what we are basing this on. In addition to that, as Dave said, the key thing here is what we do with the operating plan so that we put ourselves in a position so that if this is shallow, we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth. If it's not shallow, if it actually goes the other way, we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustments to just continue to do the right thing from a free cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint.

And that's why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it's up slightly but it's still running at about 4 weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable.

So we haven't recognized revenue for that. So that's one advantage of having that consignment, that inventory like that. And so that's the data point we have and we use that to forecast the next quarter's revenue. And the other data point is what Dave already mentioned, right, cancellations. They're up slightly but they continue at low levels and our lead times have remained stable."

As you went through those other downturns, the ups weren't very strong and therefore the downs weren't very strong, right? And I think we've just described those as we've moved through them. It's just operating in a world that really have low economic growth, right? So the last couple of years, certainly, we've had much stronger upturn in the economy overall. The economic growth has been stronger over the last couple of years. So that's certainly different. I think that our business has continued to evolve. We have more industrial, more automotive business. We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we've continued to invest in our 300-millimeter analog footprint and grow. So we've got that going into the numbers. So -- and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we're generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%. Those are good, strong numbers. And I think that those are the things that give us confidence to continue to make the investments, to make the business stronger, investing in the competitive advantages. Markets will strengthen and weaken over periods of time. But we continue to stay focused on our opportunity."

So yes, to Dave's point, we have demonstrated for a number of years now the strength of the business model. And that's through ups and now, downs. And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory. And we'll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we'll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx -- as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it's already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%. And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years. So I want you, Vivek, to consider that and think about that. So that will be -- that's how we are looking at it and how we are planning the next tranche of capacity. Do you have another question?"

And that's how we view that. We suggest you also look at it that way and then it's easier to then look at it on a trailing 12-month basis. It gets some of the quarter-to-quarter transitions out of the way. That can be a little noisy. So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter -- or last year, I'm sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail.
