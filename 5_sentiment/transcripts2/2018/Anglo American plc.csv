It's my great pleasure to welcome you all to our 2017 full year results presentation. 
Let me first please just mention about the fire alarms and exits. There are no drills this morning. So if it goes off, its real. I'm sure, they will follow an announcement just in case we haven't the fire alarm, but there are 4 exits. There are 2 at the back, 2 at the front. And the simplest way is the go back out this way you came and follow the signs, and you will be shepherded out on 
Let me just before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, let me just quickly refresh you on board changes that we had last year. So Steve, of course, you know very well already, took over from René Médori. We had 2 new Non-Executive Directors joined us Nolitha Fakude, South African businesswoman; and Ian Ashby, a long serving mining and very experienced miner. And finally, myself, who had the great privilege and pleasure to take over from John Parker as Chairman of Anglo American. 
And I think, that's enough for me. Let me hand over to Mark, who is going to kick off our results presentation."

Well, welcome ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for taking the time to join us. As always, I'd like to acknowledge Stuart and welcome.

Well, welcome ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for taking the time to join us. As always, I'd like to acknowledge Stuart and welcome. I up there in another board member and my colleagues, my executive colleagues that are scattered around the audience. 
What I would encourage you to do, again, is to catch them after the presentation from them, you will find the real story. I think it's important that you hear from them what changes are occurring. And certainly, from our perspective, I think, it's important to get to know who is actually running the business. 
So, again, thank you very much for joining us here today. From our point of view in terms of the agenda, I'll kick away with very short business overview. Stephen will pull apart the numbers and try and help people understand what's behind the results. And then, from my perspective, I'll focus on where to from here and, in particular, I'll be focusing on the quality of our asset portfolio, number one. 
I'll talk about our capabilities and the work we're doing to continue to improve the business. And then finally, pull apart our capital allocation and the discipline that, I think, it's been very important behind the performance improvement over the last 5 years and talk about how we're thinking about the future in terms of capital allocation. 
So to the numbers. I think the simple message is, we've done what we said we do. Production volumes are up 5%, reflecting improvements and the commissioning of new projects, consistent with the performance improvement. We've also exceeded our cost and volume improvements that we target for the year that was $1 billion or at $1.1 billion. Earnings and cash flow reflect by the continuing improvements in the business. And yes, we saw some help from process, but almost half of that improvement is being delivered on the back of the improvements we've seen in the business that we've delivered in the business. 
Cash flow, $4.9 billion, that's been very important in terms of improving in debt position. EBITDA margins were up 15% and 40%. And for us, very important number. Return on capital employed now at 19%. 
For us, the disappointment in the year safety. We've improved our fatality frequency rate by 40%, but one would never say that's a good number nonfatalities in the year, exceptionally disappointing for us. 
We have established an elimination of fatalities task force, working across the business looking to drive the next level of performance to 0. And for us, we've still got a way to go. 6 of those fatalities were in Platinum and 3 in Collahuasi, South Africa. So, in particular, the focus in South Africa is going to be very important for us. And so, a lot of work still to be done. 
Across occupational health and the environmental issues, being well managed during the course of the last few years. We continue to improve the business as planning and execution disciplines have been improved. So still some work to do on safety. Other areas, making good progress. 
In terms of driving the results, productivity improvement since 2012 significant, around 80%. Half coming from portfolio changes. The other half coming from internal efficiency improvements. The most pleasing aspect of the 2017 year was a 28% improvement in productivity. And that's a significant improvement and explains a good part of the cost-reduction performance during the quarter of the year. 
Yes, again, we got some price pressures -- we got some price help, but some of that was taken away by foreign exchange and inflation, and Stephen will talk to that. So the 28% productivity very important in supporting the improvement work. 
Over the same time, we've seen a 26% reduction in unit costs. And from our point of view, the real cost improvement has been something like 40% when I take inflation and foreign exchange movements into account. 
Despite the sale of 30-odd assets, we've actually delivered 9% more production than what we were doing 2012. And I think that gives you a sense of this kind of improvement inside the business. 
In terms of EBITDA margins, we're up to 40%, and that's the see-through margin based on the mining business itself. And again, the key drivers, productivity improvement. The efficiencies that we've also achieved through the implementation of the operating model and the technical changes that we talked about back in 2013, 2014 improvement. And with our marketing focus on high-quality products and we'll talk about some of our niche positioning in the in particular, has helped us improve the realized process, particularly in the box area. 
And so with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."
409115,552669241,1399614,"Anglo American plc, 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark. Just before I get start numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that we hear back in July with my first half year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So my decision. I",1796,"Thanks very much, Mark. Just before I get start numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that we hear back in July with my first half year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So my decision. I was around 2 things. One was So the team back in Australia was yellow and black. So I had to find the team with yellow and black because some of the gear. And the other one was being a good finance person about capital discipline and cash flow management. And so I'll try to principles  we're corporate life into my personal life. And one of the other executives, so one of the colleagues work has membership ticket So I thought -- and he travels a lot. 
So I thought chance at leat those tickets out the some stage for the season. So I will declare my colors the yellow and black. And it's the that I'm going for. 
Okay. So let's get into the real business of the day. So it is a good set of numbers, as Mark said. And importantly, for me, it's a clean set of numbers. So the things that we've been focusing on through the business, simply showing through the numbers and the outputs. 
The other important thing for me and for Mark and the whole executive team is really that we've been delivering And that's really important factor for us. 
So I'm going to 9 slides this morning relatively quickly. We'll touch on EBITDA and how that flows in a cash flow. What we did with that cash flow, particularly in terms of capital allocation, EPS and dividends. And we're also providing a little more detail in terms of how we're looking forward and how we're thinking about the business in the years to come. 
Clearly, for '17, the priority has been around balance sheet. And you've seen that and how we've allocated the cash flow and the reduction in net debt. We've maintained a spend in terms of stay in business capital. And it's really the combination of those things that itself also for very, very strong 2018. 
So let's have a look at EBITDA in the first case. So there's really 2 key themes, you can see on the slides. So the left-hand side is really about the things. So we have had some sort of upside from commodity prices. There are up from about 16% on the prior year, but offset by strengthening in currencies and underlying inflation in the regions that we work. 
On the right-hand side, you can see more of a self-help theme. So continuing on the work we've done over recent years, the cost, the volume, the productivity improvements. If you recall at the start of the year, we've identified a $1 billion challenge. And at that stage, we've identified about half of those initiatives, and we backed ourselves to deliver the other half. So really pleasing, we delivered $1.1 billion for the year. 
I'm just touch on inflation briefly. I know there's been a lot of sort of new talk about inflation. Yes, some of you guys have better as well. And while it's maybe an emerging theme in the U.K., Europe and the U.S., it's really being part of their lives now for a couple of years in terms of the regions that we work in the countries that we're operating. 
So it's been vital that we really focus on the productivity and efficiencies, so that outpacing that in terms of the things that we're focused on. 
We haven't had the benefit of low inflation and even in areas like the deflation in recent years. And obviously, now that hasn't applied to us. I think the other thing I would just remind you of often in a period of higher inflation, it's driven by increased activity, which is fundamentally good for commodity prices in most cases. 
And obviously, the third of that is really currencies. So as we look at the data, obviously, it's a fifth straight year for us in terms of delivering those improvements. $4.2 billion since 2013. 
Now the next dollar harder than the last dollar. And similar to last year, we've identified about half of what we're going to look at in terms of our go-forward targets. We did have some headwinds this year. So we had in the first quarter. We had extensive South Africa in the first quarter. So we were able to overcome those and deliver the $1.1 billion. 
As far as I'd just remind you that that's a run rate. So $4.2 billion is a run rate number for us of improvement per annum in underlying EBITDA. But we're not going to stop here. So we've identified $800 million in terms of our target for 2019. And as I mentioned, we've identified a bit less than half in terms of specific initiatives. We're going to back ourselves to deliver the balance. 
It will be sort of a normal theme of operating cost productivity. And as we look forward then across that period to 2022, we really start to pick up some of the themes of the innovation and technology. Now we often get asked what are the things you're going to focus on. And really is some of the lot of little things hard work. It's not just one sort of key area focus or key initiatives. It's the sum of enormous number of paths that help us deliver these. 
So as we look at underlying EBITDA and the key numbers here it really reflects what we've done with portfolio, the improvements we're heading marketing, the cost, all the efficiencies tried to, we've tried to focus on and that's really delivered the strip change in underlying earnings up 48% to $3.3 billion. Free cash flow up 93% to $4.9 billion. And obviously, the measure that we absolutely is return on capital employed up 73% to 19%. 
For those of you that need to in terms of looking forward, effective tax rate in the low 30s as we go forward. 
 The year sort of focus on continued capital discipline. You recall at the start of the year, we guided to $2.5 billion. We revised that guidance down to $2.3 billion. And we came under that $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Focus for me, as I mentioned, the half year is really to 1. When we spend it, we spend it well on the things that we need to spend it on. But also are we spending enough, are we spending enough to maintain the assets in the condition that we want to maintain them? 
So look forward to 2018 guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. so last year, up about $0.2  billion on what we originally guided for 2017. Couple of reasons is a little bit of rollover from 2017 for things that we still need to get done, some stronger currencies that as we look forward and then there's business capital for some of those new projects that we've delivered assess that we've maintained within the portfolio. 
As we look beyond that in terms of some longer-term guidance $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, just to note that, that excludes unapproved projects, but it does include things like underground that already in the system. 
So focusing on the balance sheet. Net debt almost half down to $4.5 billion. That flowed very directly into the EBITDA-to-cash flow ratio 0.5 and obviously, into the gearing or leverage ratio down to 13%. 
For me, it's the combination of all of these 3 measures that I suppose are really focused on, rather than just one in particular. The sort of have at different parts in the cycle. Obviously, absolute net debt real priority for us, and we'll continue in 2018. 
We have guided in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1 to 1.5x, but it's really at low point in the cycle that we won't to exceed that 1.5 half or any sort of extended period, and we look to bring it back inside that guideline. Then, obviously, gearing or leverage really the strength of the underlying balance sheet consistency of strategy no matter what point you are in the cycle. 
Priority for us is to continue to digital in. This is really a once financial directors life cycle that you get to fundamentally reset the balance sheet in the way that we have that opportunity now. 
Now we're seeing strong process, in particular, continuing. And that's generating fairly significant cash flow for us. So we do intend to continue to take balance sheet as we go forward. 
As we look at returns to shareholders, as far as this is for us a really good example of just simply doing what we said we do. So we reinstated the dividend early at the half year, and we announced the 40% payout ratio policy. And what that has done is really exactly as it's intended, we had a high profit in the second half. So dividends are up $0.06 to $0.54, brings the total payment for the year to $1.02 or $1.3 billion to shareholders after 2017 result. And just to note that that's the highest dividend we paid in 10 years. 
So finally, for me, really this slide comeback to my little anecdote is what it's all about at the moment in terms of how we're thinking about running the business. 
So sustainable cash flow really underpins both the balance sheet and the returns to shareholders. That strength of balance sheet has really been driven well and rapidly over the last 2 years, in particular, but particularly the last 6 to 12 months. That's enabled us to return dividends to payments and significant returns to shareholders. And obviously, then we consider the discretionary options we have target. 
We will consider additional returns to shareholders as part of that evaluation. So it is as part of that choices, I should say across the bottom. Right now, though, we think we've got the right sort of balance in terms of returns to shareholders, continue with the balance sheet and sensible growth within the portfolio. 
So how did we go? You can see sort of the on the right-hand side. When I talked to the numbers, you can see, clearly, the priority was allocating cash flow to strengthen the balance sheet and appropriate returns to shareholders. 
As we look forward, what should you expect? And the answer is pretty much more So we're going to continue to focus on cash flow, balance sheet and returns to shareholders and should expect that to continue next 6 months, 6 months beyond and in the year's following. Mark, back to you."

For those that know our organization pretty well, you be aware that we've actually got 2 sitting on the Executive, Duncan and Stephen, with a man of -- or with a frequency that they change the coaches in the next few weeks given performance we move on. 
I think the most important point to make in talking about the future is to drove our line underway we are today. It is a fundamentally different business. 47% assets, yet, we're producing 9% more product. That productivity improvement and the efficiencies that go with it have helped us reduce our cost by 26%. 
Our EBITDA margins are up 33%, and this is against the 2013 performance. And that's against the backdrop of an 18% lower price basket today compared to when we did that comparison back in '13. So a 33% improvement in our industrial margins against an 18% lower price basket. 
As a consequence, cash flows and returns have substantially improved. And most importantly, return on capital employed at 19%, remains a number that we focus on as the measure whether we delivered those cash flows at the right way. 
in talking about the future, I want to focus on 3 points: firstly, we'll outline the key points in the transformed business as it is today, which builds of that foundation I'd like also to talk about how we think about capital allocation in the context that the future revolution and improvements we see available to us in the business. And then beyond that, where we see further scope for material continuous and step change improvement that we hope to deliver the $3 billion to $4 billion improvements that Stephen mentioned earlier. 
So first on the portfolio operating. Gahcho Kué delivered on time and budget. Grosvenor completed its first longwall at the end of last year. During the changeover and the team corrected some technical problems with the hydraulic support. We've started in the new year with a second longwall and so far so good. 
Minas-Rio, 26th of January is a very important day in terms of our states relicensing. During the course of this year, we'll complete the preparation for the next phase of expansion. We require a confirmation that we built the asset consistent with the states relicense at the end of the year and that will hope the next phase of ramp up through '19 into '20. 
On disposals and closures, we've done a lot of cleanup work through the year, and you will see some of those transactions confirmed in January. And I think that demonstrates that continuing focus on making sure focus on the assets, the focus on margins, the focus on continuous improvement. That's where we're going with in terms of all the assets. But I want to be clear, we like what we have in terms of the assets. And now we're focused on making up current businesses improve in terms of the margins and the performance in terms of delivery of returns. 
As a consequence of the focus on asset quality and again, I'll make the point that it's about the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio. We have a business that is diversified by commodity and by geography. Our job, as a leadership team, is to bring the capabilities that we have within the business to bear on those assets and with the unique nature of the portfolio provide what we think is a very unique value proposition to our shareholders. 
And consistent with the geographic conversation, I should make a couple of points from South Africa. In the last 3 years, we've gone through major restructuring of all our businesses in South Africa. We've gone from 31 assets to 17 assets. And with the efficiency improvements, we've also delivered across the portfolio. Our EBITDA margin is around 35%. We generated $2.3 billion free cash flow last year. And we delivered a healthy return on capital employed to 23%. 
We're encouraged with the leadership changes in the country. And certainly, we're encouraged with the hand that the to the industry of the court case around the Mining Charter, I think it's a very important development. And so from our point of view, we're very focused on working across the portfolio and with the government and the stakeholders to make sure that our South African business remains competitive and continues to improve. 
South Africa is like all other jurisdictions, from our point of view, we want policy certainty and we make sure that we're doing the right things in the country to make sure that we've got a competitive industry. And when it can be demonstrated, we can make returns in the country then investment follows, which is very simple thesis and one that drives our behavior across the global portfolio. 
In terms of capital allocation, Steven has outlined our broader approach to capital and how we think about capital. I'd like to add some further shape to that conversation. Dealing with both discipline and our allocation priorities, a track record over the last 5 years has been one of discipline and delivery. And we're determined to repeat that in terms of the next 5 years. 
1 statistic that, I think, was very important to reflect on, in 2012, our sustaining capital was $2.9 billion. In 2017, it was $1.8 billion. And our production was actually 9% higher than it was in 2012. And yes little bit of lumpiness in some of those capital numbers. But from a sustaining position, the efficiencies we've improved -- or we've achieved in, our capital spend reflect the efficiencies we've achieved throughout the operations with the application of the operating model. 
On the portfolio, the focus, again, is on asset quality. Second, any expansion object or any expansion proposal that we look at is subject to intense competition for capital and is scrutinized against strict investment criteria at each stage 
In copper, we've got significant growth options both inside the assets that we've got operating today and with our greenfields potential in Quellaveco. We like the commodity, we like the resources we've got, we like the assets we've got. And we believe we've got the potential to continue to improve the copper business. 
On De Beers, as you would expect, we continue to supply to market demand. And as we see demand growing, we have the capacity to respond to the market in a sensible way without significant capital allocation. 
On Platinum, we're still in the business improvement journey. And we're in a market that doesn't require more products. So the focus has to be on continuing efficiency drives and incremental improvements, and that journey is continuing. 
On  we've developed the last few years. There has been significant capital So today, we're working hard to continue to improve our margins to make sure those assets are delivering on their potential. And once we'll continue to spend money on incremental improvements, that business is playing a very important role in generating significant cash, helping us without debt. And it, certainly, has turned out to be a great decision on making sure that we stayed focused on value and get the quality of the assets. And from our perspective, the team has done a great job in delivering on the expectations that we saw and the ability we see -- or the potential we see in those assets. 
Now continuing with the capital allocation theme, I think it's important to make a few points in respect to important markets from our point of view. We will allocate capital if the demand is there for our products. We certainly have incremental improvement opportunities that we will encourage and support But in terms of understanding the business and where it sits, I'll give you a sense of how we think about the business. 
On trading conditions, recent condition -- or recent indicators trading conditions, particularly in the U.S. are pretty strong. We also see opportunities in other markets. 
One of the most features of what we've seen in the market over the last 18 months is the amount of dominance that are buying and the 45% represents the amount of dominance both by millennial's in our 4 most significant markets. And people say that maybe buying changing. But from our point of view, millennial's are single most important of our product. 
And so I think from our point of view, that's a great outcome and certainly, shows that people buying diamonds for engagement rings, but they're also buying diamonds to celebrate other significant events in their lives. And they're looking for something that special that's unique and that's something special about the event and the person, which they celebrating that event with. 
The other significant change in the market dynamics is self purchases by women are growing. And a few years back, it was around 22%. Today, 33%. So the autonomy and the change in the demographics in purchasing behaviors is very much related to women. And certainly, from our point of view, the team have done in terms of UN female conversations and positioning the business in a different -- very different way have been very effective  in the marketing certainly. 
On geographic demand, again, the U.S. remains our most important market. And certainly, in the last 3 months, we've seen encouraging trends. We'll continue to commit to marketing expenditures. And from our point of view, we think that's very important in making sure that we promote our goods and see growth in the market. 
And on the other side of the coin in terms of synthetics, I think, certainly, deserve a comment as we had a few questions from people in the market. The why I think to characterize synthetics is there a very different market offering like compete in a different market, whether it be with crystal or other products such as costume jewelry. 
From our point of view, it's important that we continue to differentiate the value proposition for It's unique. It's rare. And from our point of view, that proposition still holds. The responsibility of us at De Beers and the industry is to make sure that, that proposition is continue to be articulating in a very clear way. 
On PGM's, electrification of the drive track, certainly something that we're aware of and watching very carefully. But let's put it in the into context, the drivetrain or the small vehicle, electric vehicles of the small diesel vehicles in Europe represent about 15% of the market for our products. 
The overall growth in demand for vehicles continues to outweigh the switching from diesel to small-scale electric vehicles. We expect that those trends will hold well up to 2030. The question we have in our minds is how much will fuel sales play into that market and counterbalance and drive growth across the sector. 
Certainly, as an industry, we have to do more to promote our products, but from our point of view, we think the prognosis for our products is very solid over the next few years. And in terms of the longer-term, hydrogen and fuel cells will be the game changer. 
We're just not sure of the timing. So we have to make sure that we remain and continue to move to the left of the cost curve in our industry. And we think, from our perspective, there are a lot of things that we can manage and improv and certainly help demand prognosis for us in the industry. 
Consistent with our overall thesis on quality of assets, in all markets, we see challenges to the demand for our products. The good thing about our position, particularly with the Mogalakwena, is that even today where people would say it's a pretty tough market for PGM's. We've delivered a 54% margin in 2017. And when you look at the character of our revenues, 40% platinum, 40% pallidum. And overtime, base metals and other products will play a more important role in the revenue stream. 
So 54% margin of a diversified revenue mix is a very important position. And we've still got a lot of improvement that we can deliver through the operating improvement programs that we see and the application of new technologies that both Chris and Tony working on across the asset. 
Amandelbult, significant resource, needs to continue to improve its cost 25% cost reduction. That will be important in terms of their business, focused on both safety and productivity. 
Our processing operations, arguably, the most efficient in the industry, delivering a stable 9% margin. We need to continue to improve to make sure we stay there. But for us, we think we're very well positioned in the industry, drive to the left, protect margins. And the long-term prognosis is pretty good when you think about the new technologies in fuel cell and hydrogen that you can -- that could impact us in a very positive way. 
Again, capital allocation We've been very targeted in the way we've developed the portfolio. In going from 68 assets down to 37 assets, we did sell a number of coal and smaller scale assets. So today, we have niche positions  Minas-Rio, quality assets, good margins, and we continue to improve our performance in each one of those areas. 
Peter, partners in positioning those products at the top end of the revenue scale. And so as a consequence, our margins in those businesses are challenging the lower cost, lower quality producers  And for us, margins drive returns. So making sure we keep our capital allocation tight, we drive our revenues and our costs and our margins returns challenging the major players in the industry. 
Again, I've got to acknowledge the team through a tough time in the last 4 years, but the performance that they've delivered while going through some uncertainties has been exceptional and the fact that we've kept those assets as a reflection of the great work they've done in improving the cost and efficiencies across the business. 
With an asset sweep of around 35 assets, we've got lots of opportunities to improve the business on an incremental basis. That is small scale capital, quick written projects, that add cash flow and returns to the business. 
The couple of examples Grosvenor by doing bottlenecking the processing plant, we get ourselves another 25% capacity, continues to help improve our cost position. It's $200 million. 
In De Beers, some of our highest value diamonds delivered from our Marine operations in the another ship less than a 3-year payback, again a very strong business developing. We have a number of other options across the portfolio, copper, De Beers, PGM's, Mogalakwena  a number of options that we can kick into place depending on market demand and the margins that we see can be delivered from those assets. 
So again, an exciting range of portfolio options across the business. 
In terms of greenfields remains a very important resource in the context of Anglo American. We're currently finalizing our feasibility work. So we're going through the verification processes post the feasibility. We expect to bring the project to the board for review at the 
It's a significant resource. We believe there are significant additional resources that could be added to improve the 30-year life that we see today, potentially doubling that life. The current estimates and operating cost around the Pound. And we've done a lot of work in de-risking the asset both from a geotechnical point of view or the permits are in place. We've built our relationship with the local community. We've built our relationship with the government. And certainly, from our point of view, we're doing the final work, so that we can bring the project to both the middle of the year. We would expect during the course of the year to make a final decision, but I certainly don't want to preempt the decision. The board would make. And so again, we are planning to take the project to the board mid-year. If there's work to be done to complete, I wouldn't expect to be significant. So during the course of the year, we'd expect to be moving forward. 
of the project is also an important principle or important point to make. We believe it's appropriate for these types of projects to bring in partners that add value, that can support the development of these types of projects, both from a risk point of view and to bring value forward. 
So thinking about would be on the basis of value. So getting that balance right is something that we'll talk to the board, and we're talking to the board about as a part of the process. 
Over the last 5 years, we've restructured the business by about an 80% productivity improvement. Half of the productivity improvements come from portfolio changes. Half of that productivity improvements come from actual underlying efficiency improvements. 
We expect to continue to improve the business. As Stevens said, we've identified $3 billion to $4 billion with the cost and volume improvements that we expect to deliver by 2022. Now that's a run rate number.  So for us, we still see a lot of opportunities to improve. 
On the continuous improvement front with our operating model, we'd expect most assets to improve in a range 3% to 5% a year. And certain some of those improvements in our numbers. 
On a broader front, the technical team led by Tony and with the business unit leaders, we've in terms of step changes. They will tend to be a little backend loaded given the innovation where we're progressing with the energy, water, the concentrate mine  but they certainly -- they will certainly start making a contribution inside that time frame. 
Embedded in a culture of continuous improvement, every person in the business is responsible for identifying and improving their part of the business. And for us, it's a way of life and in everyday conversation across the business. So we're confident we can deliver at least $3 billion to $4 billion worth of run rate improvement over the next 3 to 5 years. 
With that type of culture, the quality of the portfolio is important. And one major of quality and potential we have is that we've got a life of mine average across those assets of around 30 years. 
Our job in the next 5 years is to continue to identify improvements and work that potential. So that every year, we're getting better across the asset suite. It also provides us with flexibility to think about where we are in the market and make judgments inside those assets in terms of the best way to operate them under various market conditions. 
That's not hydrating That's just about making sure we're delivering on the potential and responding to markets conditions, which is a lot tougher when you've got high cost assets. 
And with that, we believe with the internal opportunities we have, we can continue to grow profitable production around 16% over the next 5 years. And that includes continuous improvement in some of those projects that I've talked about in terms of opportunities. 
So finally, in terms of our investment proposition, we characterize Anglo American first of the acid-base. We've got a portfolio, high-quality assets that have the potential to continue to improve as we get smarter. Second, we've built the people capabilities to get the best out of those assets. And three, we've instilled an operating capital discipline that understands our job is to deliver cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis. 
We put ourselves in a position where we don't have to do anything outside our portfolio to continue to improve or provide you with quality enhancement opportunities. 
So with that, very happy to take questions."

The permits went in place. And we underestimated the project cost. A number of errors, and I'm just saying we've turned that upside down and inside out to make sure we understood every lesson that can be learnt. And that very thorough. On Minas-Rio, today, the license -- the final license had remained a constraint on the footprint for the mine. So that stage 3 license has been very important With a completion of the license process we can then step out the mine and mine at 26.5 million ton rate. So now it's just physical constraint on the footprint. if you remember the Samancor incident, anything that had to do with in Brazil became an issue. And so we lost probably 18 months on that final approval as a consequence of Samancor. So we've got through that process. It's not finished. But certainly, I think point to make is the technologies that we've used for the at Minas-Rio is very different to the Samancor. It's a downstream a different engineering principle. So that's the key issue. Now going into as I said, the learnings have been applauded we have all of our major permits. We've been through all of the process with the locals, with the government, very supportive of the project. We've gone 3 times back through the engineering. We're doing a final external review. If anything we may have been a little bit conservative in the process, that's good news, but let's way to see what the final outcome is in terms of the review. All of the project disciplines have been renewed team between Tony and Duncan teams. We've pulled organization and reconstructed the business. In the last 5 years against all of the major projects that we had when I started back in 2013, we've delivered all of those projects on time for $1 billion less than the estimate I gave you back in 2013. So the disciplines are there, the learnings have been applied, we've got a different team looking at this business. This is a different business and the approach to different to what would you've seen with Minas-Rio."

Second, are you expect CapEx to increase by about $500 million next year give us an idea which divisions, which projects will be the main drivers here? Third, the diamond production guidance, you expect 2018 to be a bumpy year. And then, production to go down to about 32 million carats. Is just because this is the physical constraint, you cannot go higher? Or is this how you see the market don't see more demand? And finally, just very short."

But really as far as the thing that placed about is the translation of EBITDA into cash flow. It's probably focus. So I'm pleased about that. Yes, working capital has been a focus. And I think I flagged that at the half year as well. So I can't promise we're going to continue to reduce it. What I can promise is that we'll continue to understand it better and better in terms of days, et cetera. So yes, we saw probably a little bit of price increase receivables towards the end of the year. Inventories, in fact, will probably a little bit higher than we'd hope in a couple of areas. So in and in particularly, we couldn't all get the tons to the ports that we wanted. But offsetting that was probably a really positive moving creditors, which is probably a little more that what people were expecting. And one of the biggest things in that is being the prepayment that we have through the platinum business, increased and also some of the change in the arrangements as we have moved some of the operations and joint ventures into sort of processing of concentrates contracts. You've seen that translate into some working capital movements as well. So I'm pretty comfortable with where it is from working capital point of view. But I wouldn't be banking on major steps forward from that from a dollar point of view. On the  so yes, there's a couple of timing things, probably the major one I'd point out would be dryer. We will probably have a bit of -- probably $400 million pick up, I think, towards the tail end of 2018. And that's just timing as we have come out of constructions and lower processing profits. So that will true it self through 2018. On CapEx, so again, just a reminder, our original guidance was $2.5 billion. Our guidance into next year was $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Again, carryover from '17 FX and some additional projects that and probably the influences. The majority of the CapEx that was really around stay in business mine development. So they're really the key things that we're focused on. And some of that's really the continuation of the projects we've already got in play. So is a great example. That's probably the major point that was this year and next year in terms of expansion top capital. But there's still some work to do in terms of as we get ready for long hauls of things. So it's a combination. It's probably spread. So nothing on particularly sort of pull out there. Mark, I'd like you to comment on production, but obviously from underground place sort of 3 to 4 as"

Firstly, reducing our cost, so that we're actually doing better than inflation on a global basis. And we've done a pretty good job of that. In fact, our unit costs on a normal basis down 26% over the 5 years. Clearly, inflation is becoming a bigger issue, but we have to do with inflation in the jurisdictions over the years, whereas others have got a little bit of free kick with deflation in Australia region also had depreciating currency. So maybe that's starting to turn. So on that basis, we might get a more level planning field in looking forward. We don't want to rely on rising The one thing that comes with inflation is better commodity prices. We don't to rely on that. We want to do better than inflation in improving our cost structure. So on a real basis, you're chasing 3% to 5%. That's where that 3% of 5% continues improvement number is very important. Secondly, you want to try and run faster than your competitors. So there are 2 imperatives that we talk about on a monthly basis. So the continuous improvement stuff, then the step change where it occurs later in the period, which then beyond the 5 years will be very important.

The future of the industry will be determined by the policy framework that government puts in place. The one thing that, I think, characterizes Anglo American is the quality of assets we got across the globe. And we make the point very simply put. Investment follows returns, not the other way around. And we've made that directly. And I think the reason that the that is identified, the mining industry is one of the great opportunities is, we all got that last conversation And the elements that we are in the charter document, from our perspective, didn't provide a climate for returns. And therefore, capital allocation or capital spending, basically, dried up across the industry. So I think we got give you a minute time to have the right conversations, we'll come to the table looking for and providing ideas on how to make the country and the mining industry better, so that it'll attract returns, that's our job. And I think what far, they're in the same place. So it's a matter of finding what works and what works for the long term because our industry is a 30, 40-year industry. When we make investments, we make it for the long term. We want to see policies certainty that we can bank on. We've got a long way to go yet. And I think the toughest thing for the President is the expectations that being built up and the expectations over a very short period of time. We've got to give in time. It's going to take time.

I think in terms of observations, let me say the first thing, it's interesting that we had a board meeting this week, as you'd expect. There's interesting that the board delightfully continues to challenge itself and beat itself about it what we're doing everything we can and we're doing the right thing. But it's interesting if you come new and look back this business really is a fundamentally different business than it was 5 years ago. I think that really need to be remembered. Therefore, what are the priorities? I think first of all, whatever happens to the market, whatever happens to prices, whatever various commodity areas, the one thing that you can never excuse yourself on is not doing everything you can which is in your control. And I think this annual drumbeats of continuing to drive costs, efficiency, productivity improvements, volume improvements by actually running our mines the best way we know can, we know how better than the previous year and better than the competition is an annual drumbeat. And I think that's a really, really important thing to do. I think the other thing, I would say, is safety and environmental is so crucial to the mining industry. And that's somebody who is coming new in. I'm very familiar with the mining environment, but you can't choose where these mines are. They are where they are. So the environmental and the kind of community is just so fundamental to success. And I was pleased to see Mark talking very early on about how disciplined we are in our safety performance. That step change remains to be required. In terms of priorities going forward, other than those run things the best you can. I think we have to look at our business through an asset And assets include mines, also brands. And that's -- the most important thing, you can -- it's clear to me, you can't market of the fundamental problem. So I think driving all of our assets regardless of which commodity they happen to sit to the left and continuing to invest in those, which can be brought and can stay there is key. They will, therefore, result in us being in the commodities we're in. And we will be continue to be a successful mining -- major mining company. And that's kind of few words from me."

I'm assured they will follow an announcement just in case we haven't spotted that it's a fire alarm, but there are 4 exits. There are 2 at the back, 2 at the front. The simplest way is to go back out this way you came and follow the signs, and you'll be shepherded out I'm assured.
Let me -- just before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, let me just quickly refresh you on board changes that we had last year. So Stephen, of course, who you know very well already, took over from René Médori. We had 2 new Non-Executive Directors join us, Nolitha Fakude, a South African businesswoman; and Ian Ashby, a long-serving mining -- very experienced miner. And finally, myself, who had the great privilege and pleasure to take over from Sir. John Parker as Chairman of Anglo American. 
And I think, that's enough from me. Let me hand over to Mark, who's going to kick off our results presentation."

Well, welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for taking the time to join us. As always, I'd like to acknowledge Stuart and welcome. Obviously, Jim Rutherford up there in the audience, Jim, another board member. And my colleagues, my executive colleagues that are scattered around the audience. 
What I would encourage you to do, again, is to catch them after the presentation. From them, you'll find the real story. I think it's important that you hear from them what changes are occurring. And certainly, from our perspective, I think it's important to get to know who's actually running the business. So, again, thank you very much for joining us here today. 
From our point of view in terms of the agenda, I'll kick away with a very short business overview. Stephen will pull apart the numbers and try and help people understand what's behind the results. And then, from my perspective, I'll focus on where to from here and, in particular, I'll be focusing on the quality of our asset portfolio, number one. 
I'll talk about our capabilities and the work we're doing to continue to improve the business. And then finally, pull apart our capital allocation and the discipline that I think's been very important behind the performance improvement over the last 5 years and talk about how we're thinking about the future in terms of capital allocation. 
So to the numbers. I think the simple message is we've done what we said we'd do. Production volumes are up 5%, reflecting improvements and the commissioning of new projects. Consistent with the performance improvement, we've also exceeded our cost and volume improvements that we targeted for the year. That was $1 billion; we're at $1.1 billion. Earnings and cash flow reflect both the continuing improvements in the business. And yes, we saw some help from prices, but almost half of that improvement has been delivered on the back of the improvements we've seen in the business, what we've delivered in the business. 
Cash flow, $4.9 billion, that's been very important in terms of improving our debt position. EBITDA margins are up 15% at 40%. And for us, very important number, return on capital employed now at 19%. 
For us, the disappointment in the year, safety. We've improved our fatality frequency rate by 40%, but one would never say that's a good number; 9 fatalities in the year, exceptionally disappointing for us. 
We have established an Elimination of Fatalities' task force, working across the business looking to drive the next level of performance to 0. And for us, we've still got a way to go. 6 of those fatalities were in platinum and 3 in coal in South Africa. So, in particular, the focus in South Africa is going to be very important for us. And so, a lot of work still to be done. 
Across occupational health and the environmental issues, have been well managed during the course of the last few years. We continue to improve the business as our planning and execution disciplines have been improved. So still some work to do on safety. Other areas, making good progress. 
In terms of driving the results, productivity improvements since 2012 have been significant, around 80%. Half coming from portfolio changes; the other half coming from internal efficiency improvements. The most pleasing aspect of the 2017 year was the 28% improvement in productivity. And that's a significant improvement and explains a good part of the cost-reduction performance during the course of the year. 
Yes, again, we got some price pressures -- or we got some price help, but some of that was taken away by foreign exchange and inflation, and Stephen will talk to that. So the 28% productivity improvement's been very important in supporting the improvement work. 
Over the same time, we've seen a 27 -- 26% reduction in unit costs. And from our point of view, the real cost improvement has been something like 40% when I take inflation and foreign exchange movements into account. 
Despite the sale of 30-odd assets, we've actually delivered 9% more production than what we were doing 2012. And I think that gives you a sense of the scale of the improvement inside the business. 
In terms of EBITDA margins, we're up to 40%, and that's the see-through margin based on the mining business itself. And again, the key drivers, productivity improvements, the efficiencies that we've also achieved through the implementation of the operating model and the technical changes that we talked about back in 2013, 2014 made a significant improvement. And with our marketing team, the focus on high-quality products, and we'll talk about some of our niche positioning in the bulks in particular, has helped us improve the realized prices, particularly in the bulks area. 
And so with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Just before I get stuck into the numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that were here back in July, it was my first half-year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So I",1924,"Thanks very much, Mark. Just before I get stuck into the numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that were here back in July, it was my first half-year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So I have made a decision. It was based around 2 things. One was colors. So the team I batted for back in Australia wears yellow and black. So I had to find a team with yellow and black because I've got some of the gear. And the other one was, being a good finance person I am, about capital discipline and cash flow management. And so I try to apply those same principles that we do in corporate life into my personal life. And one of the other executives, so one of the colleagues at work has membership tickets for Watford, so I thought -- and he travels a lot. So I thought I've got to be a fair chance of at least pick those tickets up at some stage through the season. So I will declare my colors. They're yellow and black. And it's the mighty Hornets that I'm going for. 
Okay. So let's get into the real business of the day. So it is a good set of numbers, as Mark said. And importantly, for me, it's a clean set of numbers; so the things that we've been focusing on through the business simply showing through the numbers and the outputs. 
The other important thing for me and for Mark and the whole executive team is really, that we've been delivering on our commitments. And that's a really important fact for us. 
So I'm going to whiz through about 9 slides this morning relatively quickly. We'll touch on EBITDA and how that flows into cash flow; what we did with that cash flow, particularly in terms of capital allocation, EPS and dividends; and we're also providing a little more detail in terms of how we're looking forward and how we're thinking about the business in the years to come. 
Clearly, for '17, the priority has been around de-gearing the balance sheet. And you've seen that in how we've allocated the cash flow and the reduction in net debt. We've maintained a sensible spend in terms of stay-in-business capital. And it's really the combination of those things that sets us up also for a very, very strong 2018. 
So let's have a look at EBITDA in the first case. So there's really 2 key themes that you can see on this slide. So the left-hand side is really about the macro themes. So we have had some sort of upside from commodity prices. They're up about 16% on the prior year, but offset by strengthening in currencies and underlying inflation in the regions that we work. 
On the right-hand side, you can see more of a self-help theme. So continuing on the work we've done over recent years, the cost, the volume, the productivity improvements. If you recall at the start of the year, we'd identified a $1 billion challenge. And at that stage, we've identified about half of those initiatives, and we backed ourselves to deliver the other half. So really pleasing, we delivered $1.1 billion for the year. 
I'm just going to touch on inflation briefly. I know there's been a lot of sort of new talk about inflation. Yes, some of you guys are writing about it as well. And while it's maybe an emerging theme in the U.K., Europe and the U.S., it's really been part of our lives now for a couple of years in terms of the regions that we work in and the countries that we operate in. So it's been vital that we really focus on the productivity and efficiencies, so that we're outpacing that in terms of the things that we're focused on. 
We haven't had the benefit of low inflation and even in areas like the Pilbara, you've probably seen deflation in recent years. And obviously, that hasn't applied to us. 
I think the other thing I would just remind you of, often, in a period of higher inflation, it's driven by increased activity, which is fundamentally good for commodity prices in most cases. And obviously, the third leg of that is really currencies. 
So as we look at the detail, obviously, it's a fifth straight year for us in terms of delivering those improvements. $4.2 billion since 2013. 
Now the next dollar harder than the last dollar. And similar to last year, we've identified about half of what we're going to look at in terms of our go-forward targets. We did have some headwinds this year. So we had Cyclone Debbie in the first quarter. We had extensive rains through Southern Africa in the first quarter. So we were able to overcome those and deliver the $1.1 billion. 
I suppose I would just remind you that that's a run rate. So the $4.2 billion is a run rate number for us of improvement per annum in underlying EBITDA. 
But we're not going to stop here. So we've identified $800 million in terms of our target for 2018. And as I mentioned, we've identified a bit less than half in terms of specific initiatives. We're going to back ourselves to deliver the balance. 
It will be sort of a normal theme of operating cost, productivity. And as we look forward then across that period to 2022, we'll really start to pick up some of the themes of innovation and technology. Now we often get asked well, what are the things you're going to focus on. And it really is the sum of a lot of little things. It is hard work. It's not just one sort of key area of focus or key initiative. It's the sum of an enormous number of parts that help us deliver this.
So as we look at underlying EBITDA and the key numbers here, it really reflects what we've done with portfolio, the improvements we had in marketing, the cost out, all the efficiencies that we have tried to focus on and that's really delivered the step change in underlying earnings, up 48% to $3.3 billion; free cash flow, up 93% to $4.9 billion; and obviously, the measure that we absolutely all love is the return on capital employed, up 73% to 19%. 
For those of you that need to balance your books in terms of looking forward, effective tax rate in the low 30s as we go forward. 
The year also saw us focus on continued capital discipline. You recall at the start of the year, we'd guided to $2.5 billion. We revised that guidance down to $2.3 billion. And we came in a whisker under that $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Focus for me, as I mentioned at the half year is really twofold. One, when we spend it, we spend it well on the things that we need to spend it on. But also, are we spending enough, are we spending enough to maintain the assets in the condition that we want to maintain them? 
So we look forward to 2018, our guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. So up a smidgen on last year, up about $0.2 billion on what we originally guided for 2017. Couple of reasons. There's a little bit of rollover from 2017 for things that we still need to get done, some stronger currencies that we're assuming as we look forward; and then there's some stay-in-business capital for some of those new projects that we've delivered or for assess that we've maintained within the portfolio. 
As we look beyond that in terms of some longer-term guidance, $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, just to note that, that excludes unapproved projects, but it does include things like the Venetia underground that are already sort of in the system. 
So focusing on the balance sheet. Net debt almost halved down to $4.5 billion. That flowed very directly into the EBITDA-to-cash flow ratio 0.5 and obviously, into the gearing or leverage ratio down to 13%. 
For me, it's the combination of all of these 3 measures that I suppose I really focus on, rather than just one in particular. They sort of have their place at different points in the cycle. Obviously, absolute net debt, a real priority for us, and we'll continue in 2018. 
We have guided in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1 to 1.5x, but it's really at that low point in the cycle that we wouldn't want to exceed that 1.5x for any sort of extended period, and we'd look to bring it back inside that guideline. Then, obviously, gearing or leverage, really the strength of the underlying balance sheet that allows you to keep that consistency of strategy no matter what point you are in the cycle. 
Priority for us is to continue to de-gear. This is really a ""once in a financial director's life cycle"" that you get to fundamentally reset the balance sheet in the way that we have that opportunity now. 
Now we are seeing strong bulk prices, in particular, continuing. And that's generating fairly significant cash flow for us. So we do intend to continue to de-gear the balance sheet as we go forward. 
As we look at returns to shareholders, I suppose this is, for us, a really good example of just simply doing what we said we'd do. So we reinstated the dividend early at the half-year, and we announced a 40% payout ratio policy. And what that has done is really exactly as it's intended. We had a high profit in the second half. So dividends are up $0.06 to $0.54, brings the total payment for the year to $1.02 or $1.3 billion to shareholders off the 2017 result. And just to note that that's the highest dividend we've paid in 10 years. 
So finally for me, really, this slide, coming back to my little anecdote at the start, this is what it's all about at the moment in terms of how we're thinking about running the business. 
So sustainable cash flow really underpins both the balance sheet and the returns to shareholders. That strength of balance sheet has really been driven well and rapidly over the last 2 years, in particular, but particularly the last 6 to 12 months. That's enabled us to return dividends to payments and significant returns to shareholders. And obviously, then we consider the discretionary options we have post hitting those first lot of key targets. 
We will consider additional returns to shareholders as part of that evaluation. So it is as part of our choices, as you see across the bottom. Right now, though, we think we've got the right sort of balance in terms of returns to shareholders, continued de-gearing of the balance sheet and sensible growth where it suits us within the portfolio. 
So how did we go? You can see sort of the report card on the right-hand side. Won't talk to the numbers, you can see, clearly, the priority was allocating cash flow to strengthening the balance sheet and appropriate returns to shareholders. 
As we look forward, what should you expect? And the answer's pretty much more of the same. So we are going to continue to focus on cash flow, balance sheet and returns to shareholders and should expect that to continue next 6 months, 6 months beyond and in the years following. 
Mark, back to you."

I think the most important point to make in talking about the future is to draw a line under where we are today. It is a fundamentally different business. 47% less assets, yet, we're producing 9% more product. That productivity improvement and the efficiencies that go with it have helped us reduce our cost by 26%. 
Our EBITDA margins are up 33%, and this is against the 2013 performance. And that's against a backdrop of an 18% lower price basket today compared to when we did that comparison back in '13. So a 33% improvement in our industrial margins against an 18% lower price basket. 
As a consequence, cash flows and returns have substantially improved. And most importantly, return on capital employed at 19%, remains a number that we focus on as the measure of whether we delivered those cash flows the right way. 
In talking about the future, I want to focus on 3 points. Firstly, we'll outline the key points in the transformed business as it is today, which builds off that foundation tagline. I'd like also to talk about how we think about capital allocation in the context of the future evolution and improvements we see available to us in the business. And then beyond that, where we see further scope for material continuous and step change improvements that will help deliver the $3 billion to $4 billion improvements that Stephen mentioned earlier. 
So first on the portfolio upgrading. Gahcho Kué delivered on time and budget. Grosvenor completed its first longwall at the end of last year. During the changeover, Seamus and the team corrected some technical problems with the hydraulic supports. We've started in the new year with a second longwall and so far, so good. 
Minas-Rio, 26th of January is a very important date in terms of our Stage 3 licensing. During the course of this year, we'll complete the preparation for the next phase of expansion. We require a confirmation that we've built the asset consistent with the Stage 3 license at the end of the year, and that will help us then start the next phase of ramp up through '19 into '20. 
On disposals and closures, we've done a lot of cleanup work through the year, and you will see some of those transactions confirmed in January. And I think that demonstrates that continuing focus on making sure that it's the focus on the assets, the focus on margins, the focus on continuous improvement, that's where we're going with in terms of all the assets. But I want to be clear. We like what we have in terms of the assets. And now we're focused on making our current businesses improve in terms of their margins and their performance in terms of delivery of returns. 
As a consequence of the focus on asset quality, and again, I make the point that it's about the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, we have a business that is diversified by commodity and by geography. Our job, as a leadership team, is to bring the capabilities that we have within the business to bear on those assets and, with the unique nature of the portfolio, provide what we think is a very unique value proposition to our shareholders. 
And consistent with the geographic conversation, I should make a couple of points on South Africa. In the last 3 years, we've gone through major restructuring of all our businesses in South Africa. We've gone from 31 assets to 17 assets. And with the efficiency improvements that we've also delivered across the portfolio, our EBITDA margin's around 35%, we generated $2.3 billion free cash flow last year and we delivered a healthy return on capital employed of 23%. 
We're encouraged with the leadership changes in the country. And certainly, we're encouraged with the hand that the President has offered to the industry. The deferral of the court case around the Mining Charter, I think's a very important development. And so from our point of view, we're very focused on working across the portfolio and with the government and with other stakeholders to make sure that our South African business remains competitive and continues to improve. 
South Africa is like all other jurisdictions. From our point of view, we want policy certainty and that we make sure that we're doing the right things in the country to make sure that we've got a competitive industry. And when it can be demonstrated we can make returns in the country, then investment follows. It's a very simple thesis and one that drives our behavior across the global portfolio. 
In terms of capital allocation, Stephen has outlined our broader approach to capital and how we think about capital. I'd like to add some further shape to that conversation, dealing with both discipline and our allocation priorities. Our track record over the last 5 years has been one of discipline and delivery. And we're determined to repeat that in terms of the next 5 years. 
One statistic that I thought was very important to reflect on, in 2012, our sustaining capital was $2.9 billion. In 2017, it was $1.8 billion. And our production was actually 9% higher than it was in 2012. And yes, there's always a bit of lumpiness in some of those capital numbers. But from a sustaining position, the efficiencies we've improved -- or we've achieved in our capital spend reflect the efficiencies we've achieved throughout the operations with the application of the operating model. 
On the portfolio, the focus, again, is on asset quality. Second, any expansion object -- or any expansion proposal that we look at is subject to intense competition for capital and is scrutinized against strict investment criteria at each stage gate.
In copper, we've got significant growth options both inside the assets that we've got operating today and with our greenfields potential in Quellaveco. We like the commodity, we like the resources we've got, we like the assets we've got. And we believe we've got the potential to continue to improve the copper business. 
On De Beers, as you would expect, we continue to supply to market demand. And as we see demand growing, we have the capacity to respond to the market in a sensible way without significant capital allocation. 
On platinum, we're still in the business improvement journey. And we're in a market that doesn't require more products. So the focus has to be on continuing efficiency drives and incremental improvements, and that journey is continuing. 
On bulks, we've developed Kolomela, Grosvenor and Minas over the last few years. There's been significant capital outlay, so today, we're working hard to continue to improve our margins, make sure those assets are delivering on their potential. And whilst we'll continue to spend money on incremental improvements, that business is playing a very important role in generating significant cash, helping us with our debt and it certainly has turned out to be a great decision on making sure that we stayed focused on value and kept the quality of the assets. And from our perspective, the team has done a great job in delivering on the expectations that we saw and the ability that we see -- or the potential we see in those assets. 
Now continuing with the capital allocation theme, I think it's important to make a few points in respect of important markets from our point of view. We will allocate capital to De Beers if the demand is there for our products. We certainly have incremental improvement opportunities that we'll encourage and support Bruce to pursue. But in terms of understanding the business and where it sits, I'll give you a sense of how we think about the business. 
On trading conditions, recent condition -- or recent indicators are the trading conditions, particularly in the U.S. are pretty strong although we also see opportunities in other markets. 
One of the most standout features of what we've seen in the market over the last 18 months is the amount of diamonds that millennials are buying and the 45% represents the amount of diamonds bought by millennials in our 4 most significant markets. Some people say that maybe buying patterns are changing. Well, from our point of view, millennials are our single most important buyers of our product. 
And so I think from our point of view, that's a great outcome and certainly, shows that people are still buying diamonds for engagement rings, but they're also buying diamonds to celebrate other significant events in their lives. And they're looking for something that's special that's unique and that says something special about the event and the person which they're celebrating that event with. 
The other significant change in the market dynamics is that self purchases by women are growing. And a few years back, it was around 22%. Today, 33%. So the autonomy and the change in the demographics in purchasing behaviors is very much related to women. And certainly, from our point of view, the work Bruce and the team have done in terms of the UN female conversations and positioning the business in a different -- very different way have been very effective and the marketing certainly. 
On geographic demand, again, the U.S. remains our most important market. And certainly, in the last 3 months, we've seen encouraging trends. We'll continue to commit to marketing expenditures. And from our point of view, we think that's very important in making sure that we promote our goods and see growth in the market. 
And on the other side of the coin in terms of synthetics, I think certainly deserve a comment as we've had a few questions from people in the market. The way I think to characterize synthetics is they're a very different market offering. They compete in a different market, whether it be with crystal or other products such as costume jewelry. 
From our point of view, it's important that we continue to differentiate the value proposition for a diamond. It's unique. It's rare. And from our point of view, that proposition still holds. The responsibility of us at De Beers and the industry is to make sure that, that proposition is continued to be articulated in a very clear way. 
On PGMs and electrification of the drivetrain, certainly, something that we're aware of and watching very carefully. But let's put it into context. The drivetrain or the small vehicle, electric vehicles or the small diesel vehicles in Europe represent about 15% of the market for our products. 
The overall growth in demand for vehicles continues to outweigh the switching from diesel to small-scale electric vehicles. We expect that those trends will hold reasonably well up to 2030. The question we have in our minds is how much will fuel cells play into that market and counterbalance and drive growth across the sector. 
Certainly, as an industry, we have to do more to promote our products, but from our point of view, we think the prognosis for our products is very solid over the next few years. And in terms of the longer-term, hydrogen and fuel cells will be the game changer. We're just not sure of the timing. 
So we have to make sure that we remain and continue to move to the left of the cost curve in our industry. And we think, from our perspective, there are a lot of things that we can manage and improve and certainly help demand prognosis for us in the industry. 
Consistent with our overall thesis on quality of assets, in all markets, we see challenges to the demand for our products. The good thing about our position, particularly with the Mogalakwena, is that even today, where people would say it's a pretty tough market for PGMs, we'd delivered a 54% margin in 2017. And when you look at the character of our revenues, 40% platinum, 40% palladium and over time, base metals and other products will play a more important role in the revenue stream. 
So 54% margin off a diversified revenue mix is a very important position. And we've still got a lot of improvement that we can deliver through the operating improvement programs that we see and the application of new technologies that both Chris and Tony are working on across the asset. 
Amandelbult, significant resource, needs to continue to improve its cost. Chris is targeting a 25% cost reduction. That will be important in terms of our business, focused on both safety and productivity. 
Our processing operations, arguably, the most efficient in the industry, delivering a stable 9% margin. We need to continue to improve to make sure we stay there. But for us, we think we're very well positioned in the industry, drive to the left, protect your margins. And the long-term prognosis is pretty good when you think about the new technologies in fuel cell and hydrogen that are going -- that could impact us in a very positive way. 
Again, capital allocation, bulks. We've been very targeted in the way we've developed the bulks portfolio. In going from 68 assets down to 37 assets, we did sell a number of coal and smaller-scale assets. So today, we have niche positions, Kumba, Minas-Rio, metallurgical coal, quality assets, good margins, and we continue to improve our performance in each one of those areas. 
Seamus and Peter are partners in positioning those products at the top end of the revenue scale. And so as a consequence, our margins in those businesses are challenging the lower-cost, lower-quality producers out of the Pilbara. And for us, margins drive returns. So making sure we keep our capital allocation tight, we drive our revenues and our costs, and our margins and returns are challenging the major players in the industry. 
Again, I've got to acknowledge the bulks team. They've been through a tough time in the last 3 years, but the performance that they've delivered while going through some uncertainty has been exceptional and the fact that we've kept those assets is a reflection of the great work they've done in improving the cost and efficiencies across the business. 
With an asset suite of around 35 assets, we've got lots of opportunities to improve the business on an incremental basis. That is small-scale capital, quick-return projects that add cash flow and returns to the business. 
A couple of examples, Moranbah Grosvenor, by de-bottlenecking the processing plant, we get ourselves another 25% capacity, continues to help improve our cost position. It's a no brainer at $200 million. 
In De Beers, some of our highest-value diamonds are delivered from our Marine operations in Namibia, another ship, less than a 3-year payback, again a very strong business case that Bruce and the team are developing. 
We have a number of other options across the portfolio, copper, De Beers, PGMs, Mogalakwena, met coal, a number of options that we can kick into place depending on market demand and the margins that we see can be delivered from those assets. So again, an exciting range of portfolio options across the business. 
In terms of greenfields, Quellaveco remains a very important resource in the context of Anglo American. We're currently finalizing our feasibility work. So we're going through the verification processes post the feasibility. We expect to bring the project to the board for review at the midyear.
It's a significant resource. We believe there are significant additional resources that could be added to improve the 30-year life that we see today, potentially doubling that life. The current estimates on operating cost, around $1.10 a pound. And we've done a lot of work in de-risking the asset both from a geotechnical point of view. All of the key permits are in place. We've built our relationship with the local community. We've built our relationship with the government. And certainly, from our point of view, we're doing the final work, so that we can bring the project to the board the middle of the year. 
We would expect during the course of the year to make a final decision, but I certainly don't want to preempt the decision the board would make. And so again, we are planning to take the project to the board midyear. If there's work to be done to complete, I wouldn't expect it to be significant. So during the course of the year, we'd expect to be moving forward. 
The syndication of the project is also an important principle or important point to make. We believe it's appropriate for these types of projects to bring in partners that add value, that can support the development of these types of projects, both from a risk point of view and to bring value forward. 
So in syndicating or thinking about syndication would be on the basis of value. So getting that balance right is something that we'll talk to the board, and we are talking to the board about as a part of the process. 
Over the last 5 years, we've restructured the business. I talk about an 80% productivity improvement. Half of that productivity improvement has come from portfolio changes. Half of that productivity improvement's come from actual underlying efficiency improvements. 
We expect to continue to improve the business. As Stephen said, we've identified $3 billion to $4 billion worth of cost and volume improvements that we'd expect to deliver by 2022. Now that's a run rate number. So for us, we still see a lot of opportunities to improve. 
On the continuous improvement front with our operating model, we'd expect most assets to improve in a range 3% to 5% a year. And certainly, we're factoring some of those improvements in our numbers. 
On a broader front, the technical team, led by Tony and with the business unit leaders, we've got loftier ambitions in terms of step changes. They will tend to be a little back-end loaded given the innovation work and where we are progressing with energy, water, the concentrate, the mine, coarse particle flotation, but they certainly -- they will certainly start making a contribution inside that time frame. 
Embedded in a culture of continuous improvement, every person in the business is responsible for identifying and improving their part of the business. And for us, it's a way of life and an everyday conversation across the business. So we're confident we can deliver at least $3 billion to $4 billion worth of run-rate improvement over the next 3 to 5 years. 
With that type of culture, the quality of the portfolio is important. And one measure of quality and potential we have is that we've got a life-of-mine average across those assets of around 30 years. 
Our job in the next 5 years is to continue to identify improvements and work that potential so that every year, we're getting better across the asset suite. It also provides us with the flexibility to think about where we are in the market and make judgments inside those assets in terms of the best way to operate them under various market conditions. 
That's not about high-grading assets; that's just about making sure we're delivering on their potential and responding to market conditions, which is a lot tougher when you've got high-cost assets. 
And with that, we believe with the internal opportunities we have, we can continue to grow profitable production around 16% over the next 5 years. And that includes continuous improvement and some of those projects that I've talked about in terms of opportunities. 
So finally, in terms of our investment proposition, we characterize Anglo American today first off the asset base. We've got a portfolio of high-quality assets that have the potential to continue to improve as we get smarter. Second, we've built the people capabilities to get the best out of those assets. And three, we've instilled an operating and capital discipline that understands our job is to deliver cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis. 
We've put ourselves in a position where we don't have to do anything outside our portfolio to continue to improve or provide you with quality enhancement opportunities. 
So with that, very happy to take questions."

The permits weren't in place. And we underestimated the project cost. A number of errors, and I'm just saying we've turned that upside down and inside out to make sure we've understood every lesson that can be learnt. And that process has been very thorough. On Minas-Rio today, the license -- the final license has remained a constraint on the footprint for the mine. So that Stage 3 license has been very important to us. So the -- with the completion of the license process, we can then step out the mine and mine at the 26.5 million tonne rate. So now it's just physical constraint on the footprint. If you remember the Samarco incident, anything that had anything to do with the tailings dam in Brazil became an issue. And so we lost probably 18 months, Seamus, on that final approval as a consequence of Samarco. So we've got through that process. It's not finished. But certainly, I think a fair point to make is the technologies that we've used for the tailings dam at Minas-Rio is very different to the Samarco. It's a downstream lift, so a different engineering principle. So that's the key issue. Now going into Quellaveco, as I said, the learnings have been applied. At Quellaveco, we have all of our major permits. We've been through all of the process with the locals, with the government, very supportive of the project. We've gone 3 times back through the engineering. We're doing a final external review. And if anything, they're arguing that we may have been a little bit conservative in the process, that's good news, but let's wait and see what the final outcome is in terms of the review. All of the project disciplines have been renewed. And under Tony and the team and between Tony and Duncan and their teams, we've pulled apart the organization and reconstructed the business. In the last 5 years, against all of the major projects that we had when I started back in 2013, we've delivered all of those projects on time for $1 billion less than the estimate I gave you back in 2013. So the disciplines are there, the learnings have been applied, we've got a different team looking at this business. This is a different business and the approach to a Quellaveco is very different to what would you have seen with Minas-Rio."

So I wonder on normalized working capital and excluding this movement in deferred taxes, what would be the adjusted net debt figure for the year? That's question number one. Second, you expect CapEx to increase by about $500 million next year. If you could give us an idea which divisions, which projects will be the main drivers here? Third, the diamond production guidance, you expect 2018 to be a bumpy year and then, production to go down to about 20 -- up to about 32 million carats.

But really, I suppose, the thing we're pleased about is the translation of EBITDA into cash flow. That's probably been the primary focus. So I'm pleased about that. Yes, working capital has been a focus. And I think I flagged that at the half year as well. So I can't promise we're going to continue to reduce it. What I can promise is that we will continue to understand it better and better in terms of days, et cetera. So yes, we saw probably a little bit of price increase flow-through in your receivables towards the end of the year. Inventories, in fact, were probably a little bit higher than we'd hoped in a couple of areas, so. In Kumba, and in Met Coal in particular, we couldn't quite get all the tonnes to the ports that we wanted. But offsetting that was probably a really positive moving creditors, which is probably a little more than what people were expecting. And one of the biggest things in that is paying the prepayment that we have through the platinum business, increased again this year, and also some of the change in the arrangements as we have moved some of the operations and joint ventures into sort of processing of concentrates have POC contracts. You've seen that translate into some working capital movements as well. So listen, I'm pretty comfortable with where it is, from a working capital point of view, but I wouldn't be banking on major, major steps forward from that, from a dollar point of view. On the tech front, so yes, there's a couple of timing things, probably the major one I'd point out would be Met Coal in Australia. We will probably have a bit of a -- probably about $400 million pool pick up, I think, towards the tail end of 2018. And that's just timing, as we have come out of constructions and lower prices into profits. So that will true itself out through 2018. On CapEx, so again, just a reminder, our original guidance was $2.5 billion. Our guidance into next year is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Again, carryover from '17, FX and some additional projects that we've either brought on or kept, and probably the main influences. The majority of the CapEx though, is really around stay-in business, pre-stripping and mine development. So they're really the key things that we're focused on. And some of that's really the continuation of the projects we've already got in play. So Venetia Underground is a great example. That's probably about the major point was this year and next year in terms of expansion [indiscernible], top capital. But there's still some work to do in Met Coal, in terms of, as we get ready for the next long hauls and all that sorts of things. So it's a combination. It's broadly spread. So nothing odd particularly, sort of pull out there. Mark, I'm going to let you to comment on dormant production, but obviously the switch in Venetia from an open pit to underground plays out in sort of years 3 to 4 as well."

And we look at 2 moving parts: Firstly, reducing our cost so that we are actually doing better than inflation on a global basis. And we've done a pretty good job of that. In fact, our unit costs on a normal basis are down 26% over the 5 years. Clearly, inflation is becoming a bigger issue, but we've to do with inflation in the jurisdictions we're in, over the years, whereas others have got a little bit of free kick with deflation in Australasia now, and they've also had depreciating currency. So maybe that's starting to turn. So on that basis, we might get a more level playing field in looking forward. We don't want to rely on rising commodities. The one thing that comes with inflation is better commodity prices. We don't want to rely on that. We want to do better than inflation in improving our cost structure. So on a real basis, you're chasing 3% to 5% a year. That's where that 3% of 5% continuous improvement number is very important. Secondly, you want to try and run faster than your competitors.

So yes, we can take you through the detail later, in terms of the individual assets in that, but there's some subtle influences in there that are just influencing some of the volumes as they drop out in '18."

Now there's a lot of things that are going to come through and feed through our business as we keep getting more disciplined, and then adapting and running with technology and innovation. And then, particularly on the innovation side, the things that Tony's previously spoken about, about our water use, our crushing technology, our recovery and our use of energy. All of those things will probably feed slightly more into the longer-term, as Mark mentioned, probably more into the 3- to 5-year. And then there's marketing initiatives that Peter will be focused on, in terms of the quality products into the market, remembering $1 extra on revenues, just as good as $1 add-on cost.

The future of the industry will be determined by the policy framework the government puts in place. The one thing that I think characterizes Anglo American is the quality of the assets we've got across the globe. And we make the point very simply put. Investment follows returns, not the other way around. And we've made that very clear. And I think the reason that the President has identified the mining industry as one of the great opportunities is, we all got that last conversation wrong. And the elements that were in the charter document, from our perspective, didn't provide a climate for returns. And therefore, capital allocation or capital spending, basically dried up across the industry. So I think we got to give you a bit of time to settle in the chair, have the right conversations. We'll come to the table looking for and providing ideas on how to make the country and the mining industry better, so it'll attract returns, that's our job. And I think, based on what I've seen so far, they're in the same place. So it's a matter of finding what works, and what works for the long term, because our industry is a 30, 40-year industry. When we make investments, we make it for the long term. We want to see policy certainty that we can bank on. We've got a long way to go yet.

I think in terms of observations, let me say the first thing, it's interesting that -- and we had a Board meeting this week, as you'd expect. It's interesting that the Board delightfully continues to challenge itself and beat itself up about what are doing everything we can and we're doing the right thing. But it's interesting, if you come in new and you look back, this business really is a fundamentally different business than it was 5 years ago. I think that really does need to be remembered. Therefore, what are the priorities? I think first of all, whatever happens to the market, whatever happens to prices, whatever happens at the various commodity areas, the one thing that you can never excuse yourself on, is not doing everything you can which is in your control. And I think this annual drumbeat of continuing to drive cost, efficiency, productivity improvements, volume improvements by actually running our mines the best way we know can, we know how, better than the previous year and better than the competition is an annual drumbeat. And I think that's a really, really important thing to do. I think the other thing, I would say is, safety and environmental is so crucial to the mining industry. And that's from somebody who's coming new in. I'm very familiar with the manufacturing environment, but you can't choose where these mines are. They are where they are. So the environmental and their kind of community engagement thing is just so fundamental to success. And I was pleased to see Mark talking very early on about how disappointed we are in our safety performance. That step change remains to be required. In terms of priorities going forward, other than those, run things the best you can. I think we have to look at our business through an asset lens. And assets include mines, also brands. And that's the most important thing, you can -- it's clear to me, you can't market or talk your way out of a fundamental cost curve problem. So I think driving all of our assets regardless of which commodity they happen to sit in, to the left, and continuing to invest in those, which can be brought there, and can stay there, is key. They will therefore, result in us being in the commodities we're in. And we will be, and continue to be a successful, diversified mining -- major mining company. And that's kind of -- few words from me."

Clearly the resource endowment is enormous, but the company doesn't seem to be fully in control, because the local's [indiscernible] at [indiscernible] requires the corporation of Quellaveco to go through that wall between the 2 mines, and clearly, for Collahuasi  you need to convince Glencore that is a good idea. And they have plenty of growth elsewhere. So why would they commit more capital? How do you extract yourself from this kind of slight dilemma? And secondly, on diamonds, I'm a bit confused. So when we talked about these the last 2 years, the capability was always put at 36 million to 37 million carats from a production perspective. I understand we may be talking about 32 now, because it's so far out, and you don't give guidance that far out. So how should I look at that gap of 5 million? Has it come down to capability, or is it just you being caution on guidance?"

And we're doing some other incremental work. So those numbers are in Bruce's forward-looking forecast. So I won't say when and how, but we have that capacity. And, in fact, we know where those numbers are. What he is doing is making sure that we've got some flexibility in how we respond to the market. Because we don't want to bring that capacity on today, when the market's still reasonably well balanced. So it's a facing issue I oppose to an absolute quantity issue, first point. Two, on copper, we're in and have been in very constructive conversations with CODELCO around the [indiscernible] . Those conversations continue. One of the difficult issues we have is that with the change of government, the senior management of CODELCO changes, but they're certainly been a good base established now, so we're going to continue working that through, and we think that's important. And we think there is a pathway there. On Collahuasi, we believe there's still a lot more improvement available, and we acknowledge the team's effort, Duncan, in terms of the improvements they've made. We want to keep seeing improvement, but we also believe, with the technical work Tony and Duncan are working on, there are some compelling new technologies that will really shape a different future for our copper business in Chile. And we think those arguments, but that need major capital leaks, in terms of delivery of improvement, by reduced water consumption, which is a no-brainer in that sort of environment. So we think, any partner we have in an asset that is sensible and rational and wants to make a lot in terms of returns, would consider those opportunities, but it's up to us to build the case, and we think we can."

The second question is outside South Africa, I mean, obviously, political changes there. We're also seeing Zimbabwe declaring itself open for business.

On Kumba, I think, in many cases when I talk to people, I don't think people recognize how significant the changes were in spinning the mine around 90 degrees. When you say it quickly, it doesn't sound like much. And as Tony pointed out, it was a fairly significant change, which took about 2 years to execute. As a consequence, that's been the major shift. And the focus on equipment productivity, I think, we're up by a factor of 150% on our major shovels now. So the reason we're delivering additional tonnage is: one, the big change in the mine; and two, the underlying productivities of the equipment, we're operating track, it used to be 4,000 hours a year, it's now 6,000 hours, so our sustainable capital is also going down. So it's sustainable right -- it's a sustainable right pull. I think the life of mine is 13 to 15 years, Duncan? What Tony and Seamus and the team are working on now, what are the new technologies to try and enhance that resource space and build more life in the asset. So that's where the focus is now Paul, and continuing cost reduction. We've got a great product. We got a lump premium, and our margins are matching the Pilbara as we speak today, how do we do better and protect that cost base with ongoing improvement. So it's cost and life, are the 2 areas of focus for the business."

In terms of the mood of the sentiment, yes, there have been some bankruptcies. I'd like to make a point that one of the bankruptcies, and there has been a fraud case that's been broadly reported, has nothing to do with De Beers. It's a separate entity and involves banks, but there are no relationships with our business. And in fact, the financial reporting transparency piece that we have put in place is designed to identify and help us identify where those things may have occurred. And so, there's been a big change in De Beers the last 15 years, as you know. So they're not connected to us. Two, the mood generally has been pretty good. I think most importantly, the U.S. selling season was very positive. And the mood coming back has been quite strong. There are always a few that may be struggling for different reasons, but so far, the feedback has been good, and certainly, encouraging from my perspective, and again looking forward where we're cautious and slightly optimistic. I've learned in this business not to get too excited by one or two sites, so. But so far, so good. And certainly, the feedback's been pretty solid. In terms of mood, or in terms of new mines being built, remember, the diamond industry is really in a -- has really got a supply problem '20, '21, '22. So we don't think those new mines will disrupt. The industry needs more mines. I think, as an industry, the key is investing in new demand. And I think the commitment ourselves have made, and are also to the creditors made, those programs are going to be very important in making sure our product is front and center in terms of consumer choices. And I think that's the key for us. From our point of view, we don't think those new mines will materially impact, given what we think we can do with the demand. Stephen?"

So that's how you get to that net $4.5 billion. What you've seen, I sort of spoke about it more at the half of the year, and there's a slide in the appendix there in terms of the debt capital structure. So we've been progressively doing a number of things, extending the maturity, shaping the profile of maturities and also then looking at how we think about both the cash we have on hand, the undrawn facilities, and as we get control over our CapEx as we get certainty over our cash performance and cash flow, just bringing all those things down and progressively just tightening up and that don't all come for free.

I see Jim Rutherford up there in the audience, Jim, another board member. And my coll",812,"Thanks, Stuart. Okay. Well, welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for taking the time to join us. As always, I'd like to acknowledge Stuart and welcome. I see Jim Rutherford up there in the audience, Jim, another board member. And my colleagues, my executive colleagues that are scattered around the audience. 
What I would encourage you to do, again, is to catch them after the presentation. From them, you'll find the real story. I think it's important that you hear from them what changes are occurring. And certainly, from our perspective, I think it's important to get to know who's actually running the business. So, again, thank you very much for joining us here today. 
From our point of view in terms of the agenda, I'll kick away with a very short business overview. Stephen will pull apart the numbers and try and help people understand what's behind the results. And then, from my perspective, I'll focus on where to from here and, in particular, I'll be focusing on the quality of our asset portfolio, number one. 
I'll talk about our capabilities and the work we're doing to continue to improve the business. And then finally, pull apart our capital allocation and the discipline that I think's been very important behind the performance improvement over the last 5 years and talk about how we're thinking about the future in terms of capital allocation. 
So to the numbers. I think the simple message is we've done what we said we'd do. Production volumes are up 5%, reflecting improvements and the commissioning of new projects. Consistent with the performance improvement, we've also exceeded our cost and volume improvements that we targeted for the year. That was $1 billion; we're at $1.1 billion. Earnings and cash flow reflect both the continuing improvements in the business. And yes, we saw some help from prices, but almost half of that improvement has been delivered on the back of the improvements we've seen in the business, what we've delivered in the business. 
Cash flow, $4.9 billion, that's been very important in terms of improving our debt position. EBITDA margins are up 15% at 40%. And for us, very important number, return on capital employed now at 19%. 
For us, the disappointment in the year, safety. We've improved our fatality frequency rate by 40%, but one would never say that's a good number; 9 fatalities in the year, exceptionally disappointing for us. 
We have established an Elimination of Fatalities task force, working across the business looking to drive the next level of performance to 0. And for us, we've still got a way to go. 6 of those fatalities were in platinum and 3 in coal in South Africa. So, in particular, the focus in South Africa is going to be very important for us. And so, a lot of work still to be done. 
Across occupational health and the environmental issues have been well managed during the course of the last few years. We continue to improve the business as our planning and execution disciplines have been improved. So still some work to do on safety. Other areas, making good progress. 
In terms of driving the results, productivity improvements since 2012 have been significant, around 80%. Half coming from portfolio changes; the other half coming from internal efficiency improvements. The most pleasing aspect of the 2017 year was the 28% improvement in productivity. And that's a significant improvement and explains a good part of the cost-reduction performance during the course of the year. 
Yes, again, we got some price pressures -- or we got some price help, but some of that was taken away by foreign exchange and inflation, and Stephen will talk to that. So the 28% productivity improvement's been very important in supporting the improvement work. 
Over the same time, we've seen a 27 -- 26% reduction in unit costs. And from our point of view, the real cost improvement has been something like 40% when I take inflation and foreign exchange movements into account. 
Despite the sale of 30-odd assets, we've actually delivered 9% more production than what we were doing in 2012. And I think that gives you a sense of the scale of the improvement inside the business. 
In terms of EBITDA margins, we're up to 40%, and that's the see-through margin based on the mining business itself. And again, the key drivers, productivity improvements, the efficiencies that we've also achieved through the implementation of the operating model and the technical changes that we talked about back in 2013, 2014 have made a significant improvement. And with our marketing team, the focus on high-quality products, and we'll talk about some of our niche positioning in the bulks in particular, has helped us improve the realized prices, particularly in the bulks area. 
And so with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."
409115,552669241,1401507,"Anglo American plc, 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark. Just before I get stuck into the numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that were here back in July, it was my first half-year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So I",1925,"Thanks very much, Mark. Just before I get stuck into the numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that were here back in July, it was my first half-year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So I have made a decision. It was based around 2 things. One was colors. So the team I batted for back in Australia wears yellow and black. So I had to find a team with yellow and black because I've got some of the gear. And the other one was, being the good finance person I am, about capital discipline and cash flow management. And so I try to apply those same principles that we do in corporate life into my personal life. And one of the other executives, so one of my colleagues at work has membership tickets for Watford, so I thought -- and he travels a lot. So I thought I've got to be a fair chance of at least pick those tickets up at some stage through the season. So I will declare my colors. They're yellow and black. And it's the mighty Hornets that I'm going for. 
Okay. So let's get into the real business of the day. So it is a good set of numbers, as Mark said. And importantly, for me, it's a clean set of numbers; so the things that we've been focusing on through the business simply showing through the numbers and the outputs. 
The other important thing for me and for Mark and the whole executive team is really that we've been delivering on our commitments. And that's a really important fact for us. 
So I'm going to whiz through about 9 slides this morning relatively quickly. We'll touch on EBITDA and how that flows into cash flow; what we did with that cash flow, particularly in terms of capital allocation, EPS and dividends; and we're also providing a little more detail in terms of how we're looking forward and how we're thinking about the business in the years to come. 
Clearly, for '17, the priority has been around de-gearing the balance sheet. And you've seen that in how we've allocated the cash flow and the reduction in net debt. We've maintained a sensible spend in terms of stay-in-business capital. And it's really the combination of those things that sets us up also for a very, very strong 2018. 
So let's have a look at EBITDA in the first case. So there's really 2 key themes that you can see on this slide. So the left-hand side is really about the macro themes. So we have had some sort of upside from commodity prices. They're up about 16% on the prior year, but offset by strengthening in currencies and underlying inflation in the regions that we work. 
On the right-hand side, you can see more of a self-help theme. So continuing on the work we've done over recent years, the cost, the volume, the productivity improvements. If you recall at the start of the year, we'd identified a $1 billion challenge. And at that stage, we'd identified about half of those initiatives, and we backed ourselves to deliver the other half. So really pleasing, we delivered $1.1 billion for the year. 
I'm just going to touch on inflation briefly. I know there's been a lot of sort of new talk about inflation. Yes, some of you guys are writing about it as well. And while it's maybe an emerging theme in the U.K., Europe and the U.S., it's really been part of our lives now for a couple of years in terms of the regions that we work in and the countries that we operate in. So it's been vital that we really focus on the productivity and efficiencies, so that we're outpacing that in terms of the things that we're focused on. 
We haven't had the benefit of low inflation and even in areas like the Pilbara, you've probably seen deflation in recent years. And obviously, that hasn't applied to us. 
I think the other thing I would just remind you of, often, in a period of higher inflation, it's driven by increased activity, which is fundamentally good for commodity prices in most cases. And obviously, the third leg of that is really currencies. 
So as we look at the detail, obviously, it's a fifth straight year for us in terms of delivering those improvements. $4.2 billion since 2013. 
Now the next dollar gets harder than the last dollar. And similar to last year, we've identified about half of what we're going to look at in terms of our go-forward targets. We did have some headwinds this year. So we had Cyclone Debbie in the first quarter. We had extensive rains through Southern Africa in the first quarter. So we were able to overcome those and deliver the $1.1 billion. 
I suppose I would just remind you that, that's a run rate. So the $4.2 billion is a run rate number for us of improvement per annum in underlying EBITDA. 
But we're not going to stop here. So we've identified $800 million in terms of our target for 2018. And as I mentioned, we've identified a bit less than half in terms of specific initiatives. We're going to back ourselves to deliver the balance. 
It will be sort of a normal theme of operating cost, productivity. And as we look forward then across that period to 2022, we'll really start to pick up some of the themes of innovation and technology. Now we often get asked, ""Well, what are the things you're going to focus on?"" And it really is the sum of a lot of little things. It is hard work. It's not just one sort of key area of focus or key initiative. It's the sum of an enormous number of parts that help us deliver this.
So as we look at underlying EBITDA and the key numbers here, it really reflects what we've done with portfolio, the improvements we had in marketing, the cost out, all the efficiencies that we have tried to focus on and that's really delivered the step change in underlying earnings, up 48% to $3.3 billion; free cash flow, up 93% to $4.9 billion; and obviously, the measure that we absolutely all love is the return on capital employed, up 73% to 19%. 
For those of you that need to balance your books in terms of looking forward, effective tax rate in the low 30s as we go forward. 
The year also saw us focus on continued capital discipline. You recall at the start of the year, we'd guided to $2.5 billion. We revised that guidance down to $2.3 billion. And we came in a whisker under that $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Focus for me, as I mentioned at the half year is really twofold. One, when we spend it, we spend it well on the things that we need to spend it on. But also, are we spending enough, are we spending enough to maintain the assets in the condition that we want to maintain them? 
So to look forward to 2018, our guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. So up a smidgen on last year, up about $0.2 billion on what we originally guided for 2017. Couple of reasons. There's a little bit of rollover from 2017 for things that we still need to get done, some stronger currencies that we're assuming as we look forward; and then there's some stay-in-business capital for some of those new projects that we've delivered or for assess that we've maintained within the portfolio. 
As we look beyond that in terms of some longer-term guidance, $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, just to note that, that excludes unapproved projects, but it does include things like the Venetia underground that are already sort of in the system. 
So focusing on the balance sheet. Net debt almost halved down to $4.5 billion. That flowed very directly into the EBITDA-to-cash flow ratio, 0.5, and obviously, into the gearing or leverage ratio down to 13%. 
For me, it's the combination of all of these 3 measures that I suppose I really focus on, rather than just one in particular. They sort of have their place at different points in the cycle. Obviously, absolute net debt, a real priority for us, and we'll continue in 2018. 
We have guided in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1 to 1.5x, but it's really at that low point in the cycle that we wouldn't want to exceed that 1.5x for any sort of extended period, and we'd look to bring it back inside that guideline. Then, obviously, gearing or leverage, really the strength of the underlying balance sheet that allows you to keep that consistency of strategy no matter what point you are in the cycle. 
Priority for us is to continue to de-gear. This is really a ""once in a financial director's life cycle"" that you get to fundamentally reset the balance sheet in the way that we have that opportunity now. 
Now we are seeing strong bulk prices, in particular, continue. And that's generating fairly significant cash flow for us. So we do intend to continue to de-gear the balance sheet as we go forward. 
As we look at returns to shareholders, I suppose this is, for us, a really good example of just simply doing what we said we'd do. So we reinstated the dividend early at the half-year, and we announced a 40% payout ratio policy. And what that has done is really exactly as it's intended. We had a higher profit in the second half. So dividends are up $0.06 to $0.54, brings the total payment for the year to $1.02 or $1.3 billion to shareholders off the 2017 result. And just to note that, that's the highest dividend we've paid in 10 years. 
So finally for me, really, this slide, coming back to my little anecdote at the start, this is what it's all about at the moment in terms of how we're thinking about running the business. 
So sustainable cash flow really underpins both the balance sheet and the returns to shareholders. That strength of balance sheet has really been driven well and rapidly over the last 2 years, in particular, but particularly the last 6 to 12 months. That's enabled us to return dividends to payments and significant returns to shareholders. And obviously, then we consider the discretionary options we have post hitting those first lot of key targets. 
We will consider additional returns to shareholders as part of that evaluation. So it is as part of our choices, as you see across the bottom. Right now, though, we think we've got the right sort of balance in terms of returns to shareholders, continued de-gearing of the balance sheet and sensible growth where it suits us within the portfolio. 
So how did we go? You can see sort of the report card on the right-hand side. Won't talk to the numbers, you can see, clearly, the priority was allocating cash flow to strengthening the balance sheet and appropriate returns to shareholders. 
As we look forward, what should you expect? And the answer's pretty much more of the same. So we are going to continue to focus on cash flow, balance sheet and returns to shareholders and should expect that to continue next 6 months, 6 months beyond and in the years following. 
Mark, back to you."

I think the most important point to make in talking about the future is to draw a line under where we are today. It is a fundamentally different business. 47% less assets, yet we're producing 9% more product. That productivity improvement and the efficiencies that go with it have helped us reduce our cost by 26%. 
Our EBITDA margins are up 33%, and this is against the 2013 performance. And that's against a backdrop of an 18% lower price basket today compared to when we did that comparison back in '13. So a 33% improvement in our industrial margins against an 18% lower price basket. 
As a consequence, cash flows and returns have substantially improved. And most importantly, return on capital employed at 19% remains a number that we focus on as the measure of whether we delivered those cash flows the right way. 
In talking about the future, I want to focus on 3 points. Firstly, we'll outline the key points in the transformed business as it is today, which builds off that foundation tagline. I'd like also to talk about how we think about capital allocation in the context of the future evolution and improvements we see available to us in the business. And then beyond that, where we see further scope for material continuous and step change improvements that will help deliver the $3 billion to $4 billion improvements that Stephen mentioned earlier. 
So first on the portfolio upgrading. Gahcho Kué delivered on time and budget. Grosvenor completed its first longwall at the end of last year. During the changeover, Seamus and the team corrected some technical problems with the hydraulic supports. We've started in the new year with a second longwall and so far, so good. 
Minas-Rio, 26th of January is a very important date in terms of our Stage 3 licensing. During the course of this year, we'll complete the preparation for the next phase of expansion. We require a confirmation that we've built the asset consistent with the Stage 3 license at the end of the year, and that will help us then start the next phase of ramp up through '19 into '20. 
On disposals and closures, we've done a lot of cleanup work through the year, and you will see some of those transactions confirmed in January. And I think that demonstrates that continuing focus on making sure that it's the focus on the assets, the focus on margins, the focus on continuous improvement, that's where we're going with in terms of all the assets. But I want to be clear. We like what we have in terms of the assets. And now we're focused on making our current businesses improve in terms of their margins and their performance in terms of delivery of returns. 
As a consequence of the focus on asset quality, and again, I make the point that it's about the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, we have a business that is diversified by commodity and by geography. Our job, as a leadership team, is to bring the capabilities that we have within the business to bear on those assets and, with the unique nature of the portfolio, provide what we think is a very unique value proposition to our shareholders. 
And consistent with the geographic conversation, I should make a couple of points on South Africa. In the last 3 years, we've gone through major restructuring of all our businesses in South Africa. We've gone from 31 assets to 17 assets. And with the efficiency improvements that we've also delivered across the portfolio, our EBITDA margin's around 35%, we generated $2.3 billion free cash flow last year and we delivered a healthy return on capital employed of 23%. 
We're encouraged with the leadership changes in the country. And certainly, we're encouraged with the hand that the President has offered to the industry. The deferral of the court case around the Mining Charter, I think's a very important development. And so from our point of view, we're very focused on working across the portfolio and with the government and with other stakeholders to make sure that our South African business remains competitive and continues to improve. 
South Africa is like all other jurisdictions. From our point of view, we want policy certainty and that we make sure that we're doing the right things in the country to make sure that we've got a competitive industry. And when it can be demonstrated we can make returns in the country, then investment follows. It's a very simple thesis and one that drives our behavior across the global portfolio. 
In terms of capital allocation, Stephen has outlined our broader approach to capital and how we think about capital. I'd like to add some further shape to that conversation, dealing with both discipline and our allocation priorities. Our track record over the last 5 years has been one of discipline and delivery. And we're determined to repeat that in terms of the next 5 years. 
One statistic that I think is very important to reflect on, in 2012, our sustaining capital was $2.9 billion. In 2017, it was $1.8 billion. And our production was actually 9% higher than it was in 2012. And yes, there's always a bit of lumpiness in some of those capital numbers. But from a sustaining position, the efficiencies we've improved -- or we've achieved in our capital spend reflect the efficiencies we've achieved throughout the operations with the application of the operating model. 
On the portfolio, the focus, again, is on asset quality. Second, any expansion object -- or any expansion proposal that we look at is subject to intense competition for capital and is scrutinized against strict investment criteria at each stage gate.
In copper, we've got significant growth options both inside the assets that we've got operating today and with our greenfields potential in the Quellaveco. We like the commodity, we like the resources we've got, we like the assets we've got. And we believe we've got the potential to continue to improve the copper business. 
On De Beers, as you would expect, we continue to supply to market demand. And as we see demand growing, we have the capacity to respond to the market in a sensible way without significant capital allocation. 
On platinum, we're still in the business improvement journey. And we're in a market that doesn't require more products. So the focus has to be on continuing efficiency drives and incremental improvements, and that journey is continuing. 
On bulks, we've developed Kolomela, Grosvenor and Minas over the last few years. There's been significant capital outlaid, so today, we're working hard to continue to improve our margins, make sure those assets are delivering on their potential. And whilst we'll continue to spend money on incremental improvements, that business is playing a very important role in generating significant cash, helping us with our debt and it certainly has turned out to be a great decision on making sure that we stayed focused on value and kept the quality of the assets. And from our perspective, the team has done a great job in delivering on the expectations that we saw and the ability that we see -- or the potential we see in those assets. 
Now continuing with the capital allocation theme, I think it's important to make a few points in respect of important markets from our point of view. We will allocate capital to De Beers if the demand is there for our products. We certainly have incremental improvement opportunities that we'll encourage and support Bruce to pursue. But in terms of understanding the business and where it sits, I'll give you a sense of how we think about the business. 
On trading conditions, recent condition -- or recent indicators are the trading conditions, particularly in the U.S., are pretty strong although we also see opportunities in other markets. 
One of the most standout features of what we've seen in the market over the last 18 months is the amount of diamonds that millennials are buying and the 45% represents the amount of diamonds bought by millennials in our 4 most significant markets. People say that maybe buying patterns are changing. Well, from our point of view, millennials are our single most important buyers of our product. 
And so I think from our point of view, that's a great outcome and certainly shows that people are still buying diamonds for engagement rings, but they're also buying diamonds to celebrate other significant events in their life. And they're looking for something that's special, that's unique and that says something special about the event and the person which they're celebrating that event with. 
The other significant change in the market dynamics is that self purchases by women are growing. And a few years back, it was around 22%. Today, 33%. So the autonomy and the change in the demographics in purchasing behaviors is very much related to women. And certainly, from our point of view, the work Bruce and the team have done in terms of the UN female conversations and positioning the business in a different -- very different way have been very effective in the marketing certainly. 
On geographic demand, again, the U.S. remains our most important market. And certainly, in the last 3 months, we've seen encouraging trends. We'll continue to commit to marketing expenditures. And from our point of view, we think that's very important in making sure that we promote our goods and see growth in the market. 
And on the other side of the coin in terms of synthetics, I think certainly deserve a comment as we've had a few questions from people in the market. The way I think to characterize synthetics is they're a very different market offering. They compete in a different market, whether it be with crystal or other products such as costume jewelry. 
From our point of view, it's important that we continue to differentiate the value proposition for a diamond. It's unique. It's rare. And from our point of view, that proposition still holds. The responsibility of us at De Beers and the industry is to make sure that, that proposition is continued to be articulated in a very clear way. 
On PGMs and electrification of the drivetrain, certainly, something that we're aware of and watching very carefully. But let's put it into context. The drivetrain or the small vehicle, electric vehicles or the small diesel vehicles in Europe represent about 15% of the market for our products. 
The overall growth in demand for vehicles continues to outweigh the switching from diesel to small-scale electric vehicles. We expect that those trends will hold reasonably well up to 2030. The question we have in our minds is how much will fuel cells play into that market and counterbalance and drive growth across the sector. 
Certainly, as an industry, we have to do more to promote our products, but from our point of view, we think the prognosis for our products is very solid over the next few years. And in terms of the longer-term, hydrogen and fuel cells will be the game changer. We're just not sure of the timing. 
So we have to make sure that we remain and continue to move to the left of the cost curve in our industry. And we think, from our perspective, there are a lot of things that we can manage and improve and certainly help demand prognosis for us in the industry. 
Consistent with our overall thesis on quality of assets, in all markets, we see challenges to the demand for our products. The good thing about our position, particularly with the Mogalakwena, is that even today, where people would say it's a pretty tough market for PGMs, we'd delivered a 54% margin in 2017. And when you look at the character of our revenues, 40% platinum, 40% palladium and over time, base metals and other products will play a more important role in the revenue stream. 
So 54% margin off a diversified revenue mix is a very important position. And we've still got a lot of improvement that we can deliver through the operating improvement programs that we see and the application of new technologies that both Chris and Tony are working on across the asset. 
Amandelbult, significant resource, needs to continue to improve its cost. Chris is targeting a 25% cost reduction. That will be important in terms of our business, focused on both safety and productivity. 
Our processing operations, arguably, the most efficient in the industry, delivering a stable 9% margin. We need to continue to improve to make sure we stay there. But for us, we think we're very well positioned in the industry, drive to the left, protect your margins. And the long-term prognosis is pretty good when you think about the new technologies in fuel cell and hydrogen that are going -- that could impact us in a very positive way. 
Again, capital allocation, bulks. We've been very targeted in the way we've developed the bulks portfolio. In going from 68 assets down to 37 assets, we did sell a number of coal and smaller-scale assets. So today, we have niche positions, Kumba, Minas-Rio, metallurgical coal, quality assets, good margins, and we continue to improve our performance in each one of those areas. 
Seamus and Peter are partners in positioning those products at the top end of the revenue scale. And so as a consequence, our margins in those businesses are challenging the lower-cost, lower-quality producers out of the Pilbara. And for us, margins drive returns. So making sure we keep our capital allocation tight, we drive our revenues and our costs, and our margins and returns are challenging the major players in the industry. 
Again, I've got to acknowledge the bulks team. They've been through a tough time in the last 3 years, but the performance that they've delivered while going through some uncertainty has been exceptional and the fact that we've kept those assets is a reflection of the great work they've done in improving the cost and efficiencies across the business. 
With an asset suite of around 35 assets, we've got lots of opportunities to improve the business on an incremental basis. That is small-scale capital, quick-return projects that add cash flow and returns to the business. 
A couple of examples, Moranbah, Grosvenor, by de-bottlenecking the processing plant, we get ourselves another 25% capacity, continues to help improve our cost position. It's a no-brainer at $200 million. 
In De Beers, some of our highest-value diamonds are delivered from our Marine operations in Namibia, another ship, less than a 3-year payback, again a very strong business case that Bruce and the team are developing. 
We have a number of other options across the portfolio, copper, De Beers, PGMs, Mogalakwena, met coal, a number of options that we can kick into place depending on market demand and the margins that we see can be delivered from those assets. So again, an exciting range of portfolio options across the business. 
In terms of greenfields, Quellaveco remains a very important resource in the context of Anglo American. We're currently finalizing our feasibility work. So we're going through the verification processes post the feasibility. We expect to bring the project to the board for review at the midyear.
It's a significant resource. We believe there are significant additional resources that could be added to improve the 30-year life that we see today, potentially doubling that life. The current estimates on operating cost, around $1.10 a pound. And we've done a lot of work in de-risking the asset both from a geotechnical point of view. All of the key permits are in place. We've built our relationship with the local community. We've built our relationship with the government. And certainly, from our point of view, we're doing the final work, so that we can bring the project to the board the middle of the year. 
We would expect during the course of the year to make a final decision, but I certainly don't want to preempt the decision the board would make. And so again, we are planning to take the project to the board midyear. If there's work to be done to complete, I wouldn't expect it to be significant. So during the course of the year, we'd expect to be moving forward. 
The syndication of the project is also an important principle or important point to make. We believe it's appropriate for these types of projects to bring in partners that add value, that can support the development of these types of projects, both from a risk point of view and to bring value forward. 
So in syndicating or thinking about syndication would be on the basis of value. So getting that balance right is something that we'll talk to the board, and we are talking to the board about as a part of the process. 
Over the last 5 years, we've restructured the business. I talk about an 80% productivity improvement. Half of that productivity improvement has come from portfolio changes. Half of that productivity improvement's come from actual underlying efficiency improvements. 
We expect to continue to improve the business. As Stephen said, we've identified $3 billion to $4 billion worth of cost and volume improvements that we'd expect to deliver by 2022. Now that's a run rate number. So for us, we still see a lot of opportunities to improve. 
On the continuous improvement front with our operating model, we'd expect most assets to improve in the range 3% to 5% a year. And certainly, we're factoring some of those improvements in our numbers. 
On a broader front, the technical team, led by Tony and with the business unit leaders, we've got loftier ambitions in terms of step changes. They will tend to be a little back-end loaded given the innovation work and where we are progressing with energy, water, the concentrate, the mine, coarse particle flotation, but they certainly -- they will certainly start making a contribution inside that time frame. 
Embedded in a culture of continuous improvement, every person in the business is responsible for identifying and improving their part of the business. And for us, it's a way of life and an everyday conversation across the business. So we're confident we can deliver at least $3 billion to $4 billion worth of run-rate improvement over the next 3 to 5 years. 
With that type of culture, the quality of the portfolio is important. And one measure of quality and potential we have is that we've got a life-of-mine average across those assets of around 30 years. 
Our job in the next 5 years is to continue to identify improvements and work that potential so that every year, we're getting better across the asset suite. It also provides us with the flexibility to think about where we are in the market and make judgments inside those assets in terms of the best way to operate them under various market conditions. 
That's not about high-grading assets; that's just about making sure we're delivering on their potential and responding to market conditions, which is a lot tougher when you've got high-cost assets. 
And with that, we believe with the internal opportunities we have, we can continue to grow profitable production around 16% over the next 5 years. And that includes continuous improvement on some of those projects that I've talked about in terms of opportunities. 
So finally, in terms of our investment proposition, we characterize Anglo American today first off the asset base. We've got a portfolio of high-quality assets that have the potential to continue to improve as we get smarter. Second, we've built the people capabilities to get the best out of those assets. And three, we've instilled an operating and capital discipline that understands our job is to deliver cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis. 
We've put ourselves in a position where we don't have to do anything outside our portfolio to continue to improve or provide you with quality enhancement opportunities. 
So with that, very happy to take questions."

The permits weren't in place. And we underestimated the project cost. A number of errors, and I'm just saying we've turned that upside down and inside out to make sure we've understood every lesson that can be learnt. And that process has been very thorough. On Minas-Rio today, the license -- the final license has remained a constraint on the footprint for the mine. So that Stage 3 license has been very important to us. So the -- with the completion of the license process, we can then step out the mine and mine at the 26.5 million tonne rate. So now it's just physical constraint on the footprint. If you remember the Samarco incident, anything that had anything to do with the tailings dam in Brazil became an issue. And so we lost probably 18 months, Seamus, on that final approval as a consequence of Samarco. So we've got through that process. It's not finished. But certainly, I think the key point to make is the technologies that we've used for the tailings dam at Minas-Rio is very different to the Samarco. It's a downstream lift, so it's a different engineering principle. So that's the key issue. Now going into Quellaveco, as I said, the learnings have been applied. At Quellaveco, we have all of our major permits. We've been through all of the process with the locals, with the government, very supportive of the project. We've gone 3 times back through the engineering. We're doing a final external review. And if anything, they're arguing that we may have been a little bit conservative in the process, that's good news, but let's wait and see what the final outcome is in terms of the review. All of the project disciplines have been renewed. And under Tony and the team and between Tony and Duncan and their teams, we've pulled apart the organization and reconstructed the business. In the last 5 years, against all of the major projects that we had when I started back in 2013, we've delivered all of those projects on time for $1 billion less than the estimate I gave you back in 2013. So the disciplines are there, the learnings have been applied, we've got a different team looking at this business. This is a different business and the approach to a Quellaveco is very different to what would you have seen with Minas-Rio."

So I wonder on normalized working capital and excluding this movement in deferred taxes, what would be the adjusted net debt figure for the year? That's question number one. Second, you expect CapEx to increase by about $500 million next year. If you could give us an idea which divisions, which projects will be the main drivers here? Third, the diamond production guidance, you expect 2018 to be a bumpy year and then, production to go down to about 20 -- up to about 32 million carats.

But really, I suppose, the thing we're pleased about is the translation of EBITDA into cash flow. That's probably been the primary focus. So I'm pleased about that. Yes, working capital has been a focus. And I think I flagged that at the half year as well. So I can't promise we're going to continue to reduce it. What I can promise is that we will continue to understand it better and better in terms of days, et cetera. So yes, we saw probably a little bit of price increase flow-through in your receivables towards the end of the year. Inventories, in fact, were probably a little bit higher than we'd hoped in a couple of areas, so. In Kumba, and in met coal in particular, we couldn't quite get all the tonnes to the ports that we wanted. But offsetting that was probably a really positive moving creditors, which is probably a little more than what people were expecting. And one of the bigger things in that has been the prepayment that we have through the platinum business increased again this year, and also some of the change in the arrangements as we have moved some of the operations and joint ventures into sort of processing of concentrates and POC contracts. You've seen that translate into some working capital movements as well. So listen, I'm pretty comfortable with where it is, from a working capital point of view, but I wouldn't be banking on major, major steps forward from that, from a dollar point of view. On the tech front, so yes, there's a couple of timing things; probably the major one I'd point out would be met coal in Australia. We will probably have a bit of a -- probably about a $400 million pool pick up, I think, towards the tail end of 2018. And that's just timing, as we have come out of constructions and lower prices into profits. So that will true itself up through 2018. On CapEx, so again, just a reminder, our original guidance was $2.5 billion. Our guidance into next year is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Again, carryover from '17, FX and some additional projects that we've either brought on or kept, are probably the main influences. The majority of the CapEx though, is really around stay-in business, pre-stripping and mine development. So they're really the key things that we're focused on. And some of that's really the continuation of the projects we've already got in play. So Venetia Underground is a great example. That's probably about the major point was this year and next year in terms of expansion of LifeX, top capital. But there's still some work to do in met coal, in terms of, as we get ready for the next long hauls and all that sorts of things. So it's a combination. It's broadly spread. So nothing odd particularly, sort of pull out there. Mark, I'm going to let you to comment on dormant production, but obviously the switch in Venetia from an open pit to underground plays out in sort of years 3 to 4 as well."

What Bruce is doing at the moment is looking in the sequencing of some of the other operations, to see that if that demand remains strong, what he can do to bring a bit more production forward to get more balance in the second year. But I think you're going to go with the guidance as it is today, knowing that Bruce and the guys are working hard to watch the demand carefully.

And we look at 2 moving parts: Firstly, reducing our cost so that we are actually doing better than inflation on a global basis. And we've done a pretty good job of that. In fact, our unit costs on a nominal basis are down 26% over the 5 years. Clearly, inflation is becoming a bigger issue, but we've to deal with inflation in the jurisdictions we're in, over the years, whereas others have got a little bit of a free kick with deflation in Australasia now, and they've also had depreciating currency. So maybe that's starting to turn. So on that basis, we might get a more level playing field in looking forward. We don't want to rely on rising commodities because the one thing that comes with inflation is better commodity prices. We don't want to rely on that. We want to do better than inflation in improving our cost structure. So on a real basis, you're chasing 3% to 5% a year. That's where that 3% of 5% continuous improvement number is very important. Secondly, you want to try and run faster than your competitors. So there are 2 imperatives that we talk about on a monthly basis.

Long haul hours and cutting rights through each of the met coal operations. Amandelbult, cost-out, inefficiencies. Improvements in Mogalakwena, [ Quisella ], one of the coal assets, getting back on track. It had a pretty tough year in 2017. Copper grades move across the years, which should be a bit better next year. And then there's all the operating efficiencies, so whether that's truck hours, digger rates, process recoveries, automation, use of data, particularly feeding into maintenance programs. Now there's a lot of things that are going to come through and feed through our business as we keep getting more disciplined, and then adapting and running with technology and innovation. And then, particularly on the innovation side, the things that Tony's previously spoken about, about our water use, our crushing technology, our recovery and our use of energy. All of those things will probably feed slightly more into the longer-term, as Mark mentioned, probably more into the 3- to 5-year. And then there's marketing initiatives that Peter will be focused on, in terms of the quality products into the market, remembering $1 extra on revenues, just as good as $1 add-on cost. So there really is no one individual thing. It's the sum of all of those parts. And there's a lot of other things I haven't mentioned, but it is a combination across volume and cost. And we'll be working really hard and backing ourselves to deliver those."

The future of the industry will be determined by the policy framework the government puts in place. The one thing that I think characterizes Anglo American is the quality of the assets we've got across the globe. And we make the point very simply put. Investment follows returns, not the other way around. And we've made that very clear. And I think the reason that the President has identified the mining industry as one of the great opportunities is, we all got that last conversation wrong. And the elements that were in that charter document, from our perspective, didn't provide a climate for returns. And therefore, capital allocation or capital spending, basically dried up across the industry. So I think we got to give them a bit of time to settle in the chair, have the right conversations. We'll come to the table looking for and providing ideas on how to make the country and the mining industry better, so it'll attract returns, that's our job. And I think, based on what I've seen so far, they're in the same place. So it's a matter of finding what works, and what works for the long term, because our industry is a 30-, 40-year industry. When we make investments, we make it for the long term. We want to see policy certainty that we can bank on. We've got a long way to go yet.

I think in terms of observations, let me say the first thing, it's interesting that -- and we had a Board meeting this week, as you'd expect. It's interesting that the Board delightfully continues to challenge itself and beat itself up about what are doing everything we can and we're doing the right thing. But it's interesting, if you come in new and you look back, this business really is a fundamentally different business than it was 5 years ago. I think that really does need to be remembered. Therefore, what are the priorities? I think first of all, whatever happens to the market, whatever happens to prices, whatever happens at the various commodity areas, the one thing that you can never excuse yourself on, is not doing everything you can which is in your control. And I think this annual drumbeat of continuing to drive cost, efficiency, productivity improvements, volume improvements by actually running our mines the best way we now can, we know how, better than the previous year and better than the competition is an annual drumbeat. And I think that's a really, really important thing to do. I think the other thing, I would say, is safety and environmental is so crucial to the mining industry. And that's from somebody who's coming new in. I'm very familiar with the manufacturing environment, but you can't choose where these mines are. They are where they are. So the environmental and their kind of community engagement thing is just so fundamental to success. And I was pleased to see Mark talking very early on about how disappointed we are in our safety performance. That step change remains to be required. In terms of priorities going forward, other than those, run things the best you can. I think we have to look at our business through an asset lens. And assets include mines, also brands. And that's the most important thing, you can -- it's clear to me, you can't market or talk your way out of a fundamental cost curve problem. So I think driving all of our assets regardless of which commodity they happen to sit in, to the left, and continuing to invest in those, which can be brought there, and can stay there, is key. They will therefore result in us being in the commodities we're in. And we will be, and continue to be a successful, diversified mining -- major mining company. And that's kind of -- few words from me."

So when we talked about these last 2 years, the capability was always put at 36 million to 37 million carats from a production perspective.

On Collahuasi, we believe there's still a lot more improvement available, and we acknowledge the team's effort, Duncan, in terms of the improvements they've made. We want to keep seeing improvement, but we also believe, with the technical work Tony and Duncan are working on, there are some compelling new technologies that will really shape a different future for our copper business in Chile.

And the focus on equipment productivity, I think, we're up by a factor of 150% on our major shovels now. So the reason we're delivering additional tonnage is: one, the big change in the mine; and two, the underlying productivities of the equipment, we're operating track, it used to be 4,000 hours a year, it's now 6,000 hours, so our sustainable capital is also going down. So it's sustainable right -- it's a sustainable right pull. I think the life of mine is 13 to 15 years, Duncan? What Tony and Seamus and the team are working on now, what are the new technologies to try and enhance that resource space and build more life in the asset. So that's where the focus is now, Paul, and continuing cost reduction. We've got a great product. We get a lump premium, and our margins are matching the Pilbara as we speak today.

In terms of the mood of the sentiment, yes, there have been some bankruptcies. I'd like to make a point that one of the bankruptcies, and there has been a fraud case that's been broadly reported, has nothing to do with De Beers. It's a separate entity and involves banks, but there are no relationships with our business. And in fact, the financial reporting transparency piece that we have put in place is designed to identify and help us identify where those things may have occurred. And so, there's been a big change in De Beers out of the last 15 years, as you know. So they're not connected to us. Two, the mood generally has been pretty good. I think most importantly, the U.S. selling season was very positive. And the mood coming back has been quite strong. There are always a few that may be struggling for different reasons, but so far, the feedback has been good, and certainly, encouraging from our perspective, and again looking forward where we're cautious and slightly optimistic. I've learned in this business not to get too excited by one or two sites, so. But so far, so good. And certainly, the feedback's been pretty solid. In terms of mood, or in terms of new mines being built, remember, the diamond industry is really in a -- has really got a supply problem '20, '21, '22. So we don't think those new mines will disrupt. The industry needs more mines. I think, as an industry, the key is investing in new demand. And I think the commitment ourselves have made, and are also to the creditors made, those programs are going to be very important in making sure our product is front and center in terms of consumer choices. And I think that's the key for us. From our point of view, we don't think those new mines will materially impact, given what we think we can do with the demand. Stephen?"

So that's how you get to that net $4.5 billion. What you've seen, I sort of spoke about it more at the half year, and there's a slide in the appendix there in terms of the debt capital structure. So we've been progressively doing a number of things, extending the maturity, shaping the profile of maturities and also then looking at how we think about both the cash we have on hand, the undrawn facilities, and as we get control over our CapEx as we get certainty over our cost performance and cash flow, just bringing all those things down and progressively just tightening up and that don't all come for free. And so, yes, we can save, let's say, $100 million as we work through that strategy to tighten those things up. So that's where our focus is on that front."

I see Jim Rutherford up there in the audience, Jim, another board member. And my colleagues, my executive colleagues that are scattered around the audience. 
What I would encourage you to do, again, is to catch them after the presentation. From them, you'll find the real story. I think it's important that you hear from them what changes are occurring. And certainly, from our perspective, I think it's important to get to know who's actually running the business. So, again, thank you very much for joining us here today. 
From our point of view in terms of the agenda, I'll kick away with a very short business overview. Stephen will pull apart the numbers and try and help people understand what's behind the results. And then, from my perspective, I'll focus on where to from here and, in particular, I'll be focusing on the quality of our asset portfolio, number one. 
I'll talk about our capabilities and the work we're doing to continue to improve the business. And then finally, pull apart our capital allocation and the discipline that I think's been very important behind the performance improvement over the last 5 years and talk about how we're thinking about the future in terms of capital allocation. 
So to the numbers. I think the simple message is we've done what we said we'd do. Production volumes are up 5%, reflecting improvements and the commissioning of new projects. Consistent with the performance improvement, we've also exceeded our cost and volume improvements that we targeted for the year. That was $1 billion; we're at $1.1 billion. Earnings and cash flow reflect both the continuing improvements in the business. And yes, we saw some help from prices, but almost half of that improvement has been delivered on the back of the improvements we've seen in the business, what we've delivered in the business. 
Cash flow, $4.9 billion, that's been very important in terms of improving our debt position. EBITDA margins are up 15% at 40%. And for us, very important number, return on capital employed now at 19%. 
For us, the disappointment in the year, safety. We've improved our fatality frequency rate by 40%, but one would never say that's a good number; 9 fatalities in the year, exceptionally disappointing for us. 
We have established an Elimination of Fatalities task force, working across the business looking to drive the next level of performance to 0. And for us, we've still got a way to go. 6 of those fatalities were in platinum and 3 in coal in South Africa. So, in particular, the focus in South Africa is going to be very important for us. And so, a lot of work still to be done. 
Across occupational health and the environmental issues have been well managed during the course of the last few years. We continue to improve the business as our planning and execution disciplines have been improved. So still some work to do on safety. Other areas, making good progress. 
In terms of driving the results, productivity improvements since 2012 have been significant, around 80%. Half coming from portfolio changes; the other half coming from internal efficiency improvements. The most pleasing aspect of the 2017 year was the 28% improvement in productivity. And that's a significant improvement and explains a good part of the cost-reduction performance during the course of the year. 
Yes, again, we got some price pressures -- or we got some price help, but some of that was taken away by foreign exchange and inflation, and Stephen will talk to that. So the 28% productivity improvement's been very important in supporting the improvement work. 
Over the same time, we've seen a 27 -- 26% reduction in unit costs. And from our point of view, the real cost improvement has been something like 40% when I take inflation and foreign exchange movements into account. 
Despite the sale of 30-odd assets, we've actually delivered 9% more production than what we were doing in 2012. And I think that gives you a sense of the scale of the improvement inside the business. 
In terms of EBITDA margins, we're up to 40%, and that's the see-through margin based on the mining business itself. And again, the key drivers, productivity improvements, the efficiencies that we've also achieved through the implementation of the operating model and the technical changes that we talked about back in 2013, 2014 have made a significant improvement. And with our marketing team, the focus on high-quality products, and we'll talk about some of our niche positioning in the bulks in particular, has helped us improve the realized prices, particularly in the bulks area. 
And so with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Just before I get stuck into the numbers, just a quick anecdote, if I may. So for those of you that were here back in July, it was my first half-year presentation, Mark was trying to convince me to go blue and go with Chelsea. So I have made a decision. It was based around 2 things. One was colors. So the team I batted for back in Australia wears yellow and black. So I had to find a team with yellow and black because I've got some of the gear. And the other one was, being the good finance person I am, about capital discipline and cash flow management. And so I try to apply those same principles that we do in corporate life into my personal life. And one of the other executives, so one of my colleagues at work has membership tickets for Watford, so I thought -- and he travels a lot. So I thought I've got to be a fair chance of at least pick those tickets up at some stage through the season. So I will declare my colors. They're yellow and black. And it's the mighty Hornets that I'm going for. 
Okay. So let's get into the real business of the day. So it is a good set of numbers, as Mark said. And importantly, for me, it's a clean set of numbers; so the things that we've been focusing on through the business simply showing through the numbers and the outputs. 
The other important thing for me and for Mark and the whole executive team is really that we've been delivering on our commitments. And that's a really important fact for us. 
So I'm going to whiz through about 9 slides this morning relatively quickly. We'll touch on EBITDA and how that flows into cash flow; what we did with that cash flow, particularly in terms of capital allocation, EPS and dividends; and we're also providing a little more detail in terms of how we're looking forward and how we're thinking about the business in the years to come. 
Clearly, for '17, the priority has been around de-gearing the balance sheet. And you've seen that in how we've allocated the cash flow and the reduction in net debt. We've maintained a sensible spend in terms of stay-in-business capital. And it's really the combination of those things that sets us up also for a very, very strong 2018. 
So let's have a look at EBITDA in the first case. So there's really 2 key themes that you can see on this slide. So the left-hand side is really about the macro themes. So we have had some sort of upside from commodity prices. They're up about 16% on the prior year, but offset by strengthening in currencies and underlying inflation in the regions that we work. 
On the right-hand side, you can see more of a self-help theme. So continuing on the work we've done over recent years, the cost, the volume, the productivity improvements. If you recall at the start of the year, we'd identified a $1 billion challenge. And at that stage, we'd identified about half of those initiatives, and we backed ourselves to deliver the other half. So really pleasing, we delivered $1.1 billion for the year. 
I'm just going to touch on inflation briefly. I know there's been a lot of sort of new talk about inflation. Yes, some of you guys are writing about it as well. And while it's maybe an emerging theme in the U.K., Europe and the U.S., it's really been part of our lives now for a couple of years in terms of the regions that we work in and the countries that we operate in. So it's been vital that we really focus on the productivity and efficiencies, so that we're outpacing that in terms of the things that we're focused on. 
We haven't had the benefit of low inflation and even in areas like the Pilbara, you've probably seen deflation in recent years. And obviously, that hasn't applied to us. 
I think the other thing I would just remind you of, often, in a period of higher inflation, it's driven by increased activity, which is fundamentally good for commodity prices in most cases. And obviously, the third leg of that is really currencies. 
So as we look at the detail, obviously, it's a fifth straight year for us in terms of delivering those improvements. $4.2 billion since 2013. 
Now the next dollar gets harder than the last dollar. And similar to last year, we've identified about half of what we're going to look at in terms of our go-forward targets. We did have some headwinds this year. So we had Cyclone Debbie in the first quarter. We had extensive rains through Southern Africa in the first quarter. So we were able to overcome those and deliver the $1.1 billion. 
I suppose I would just remind you that, that's a run rate. So the $4.2 billion is a run rate number for us of improvement per annum in underlying EBITDA. 
But we're not going to stop here. So we've identified $800 million in terms of our target for 2018. And as I mentioned, we've identified a bit less than half in terms of specific initiatives. We're going to back ourselves to deliver the balance. 
It will be sort of a normal theme of operating cost, productivity. And as we look forward then across that period to 2022, we'll really start to pick up some of the themes of innovation and technology. Now we often get asked, ""Well, what are the things you're going to focus on?"" And it really is the sum of a lot of little things. It is hard work. It's not just one sort of key area of focus or key initiative. It's the sum of an enormous number of parts that help us deliver this.
So as we look at underlying EBITDA and the key numbers here, it really reflects what we've done with portfolio, the improvements we had in marketing, the cost out, all the efficiencies that we have tried to focus on and that's really delivered the step change in underlying earnings, up 48% to $3.3 billion; free cash flow, up 93% to $4.9 billion; and obviously, the measure that we absolutely all love is the return on capital employed, up 73% to 19%. 
For those of you that need to balance your books in terms of looking forward, effective tax rate in the low 30s as we go forward. 
The year also saw us focus on continued capital discipline. You recall at the start of the year, we'd guided to $2.5 billion. We revised that guidance down to $2.3 billion. And we came in a whisker under that $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Focus for me, as I mentioned at the half year is really twofold. One, when we spend it, we spend it well on the things that we need to spend it on. But also, are we spending enough, are we spending enough to maintain the assets in the condition that we want to maintain them? 
So to look forward to 2018, our guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. So up a smidgen on last year, up about $0.2 billion on what we originally guided for 2017. Couple of reasons. There's a little bit of rollover from 2017 for things that we still need to get done, some stronger currencies that we're assuming as we look forward; and then there's some stay-in-business capital for some of those new projects that we've delivered or for assess that we've maintained within the portfolio. 
As we look beyond that in terms of some longer-term guidance, $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, just to note that, that excludes unapproved projects, but it does include things like the Venetia underground that are already sort of in the system. 
So focusing on the balance sheet. Net debt almost halved down to $4.5 billion. That flowed very directly into the EBITDA-to-cash flow ratio, 0.5, and obviously, into the gearing or leverage ratio down to 13%. 
For me, it's the combination of all of these 3 measures that I suppose I really focus on, rather than just one in particular. They sort of have their place at different points in the cycle. Obviously, absolute net debt, a real priority for us, and we'll continue in 2018. 
We have guided in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1 to 1.5x, but it's really at that low point in the cycle that we wouldn't want to exceed that 1.5x for any sort of extended period, and we'd look to bring it back inside that guideline. Then, obviously, gearing or leverage, really the strength of the underlying balance sheet that allows you to keep that consistency of strategy no matter what point you are in the cycle. 
Priority for us is to continue to de-gear. This is really a ""once in a financial director's life cycle"" that you get to fundamentally reset the balance sheet in the way that we have that opportunity now. 
Now we are seeing strong bulk prices, in particular, continue. And that's generating fairly significant cash flow for us. So we do intend to continue to de-gear the balance sheet as we go forward. 
As we look at returns to shareholders, I suppose this is, for us, a really good example of just simply doing what we said we'd do. So we reinstated the dividend early at the half-year, and we announced a 40% payout ratio policy. And what that has done is really exactly as it's intended. We had a higher profit in the second half. So dividends are up $0.06 to $0.54, brings the total payment for the year to $1.02 or $1.3 billion to shareholders off the 2017 result. And just to note that, that's the highest dividend we've paid in 10 years. 
So finally for me, really, this slide, coming back to my little anecdote at the start, this is what it's all about at the moment in terms of how we're thinking about running the business. 
So sustainable cash flow really underpins both the balance sheet and the returns to shareholders. That strength of balance sheet has really been driven well and rapidly over the last 2 years, in particular, but particularly the last 6 to 12 months. That's enabled us to return dividends to payments and significant returns to shareholders. And obviously, then we consider the discretionary options we have post hitting those first lot of key targets. 
We will consider additional returns to shareholders as part of that evaluation. So it is as part of our choices, as you see across the bottom. Right now, though, we think we've got the right sort of balance in terms of returns to shareholders, continued de-gearing of the balance sheet and sensible growth where it suits us within the portfolio. 
So how did we go? You can see sort of the report card on the right-hand side. Won't talk to the numbers, you can see, clearly, the priority was allocating cash flow to strengthening the balance sheet and appropriate returns to shareholders. 
As we look forward, what should you expect? And the answer's pretty much more of the same. So we are going to continue to focus on cash flow, balance sheet and returns to shareholders and should expect that to continue next 6 months, 6 months beyond and in the years following. 
Mark, back to you."

I think the most important point to make in talking about the future is to draw a line under where we are today. It is a fundamentally different business. 47% less assets, yet we're producing 9% more product. That productivity improvement and the efficiencies that go with it have helped us reduce our cost by 26%. 
Our EBITDA margins are up 33%, and this is against the 2013 performance. And that's against a backdrop of an 18% lower price basket today compared to when we did that comparison back in '13. So a 33% improvement in our industrial margins against an 18% lower price basket. 
As a consequence, cash flows and returns have substantially improved. And most importantly, return on capital employed at 19% remains a number that we focus on as the measure of whether we delivered those cash flows the right way. 
In talking about the future, I want to focus on 3 points. Firstly, we'll outline the key points in the transformed business as it is today, which builds off that foundation tagline. I'd like also to talk about how we think about capital allocation in the context of the future evolution and improvements we see available to us in the business. And then beyond that, where we see further scope for material continuous and step change improvements that will help deliver the $3 billion to $4 billion improvements that Stephen mentioned earlier. 
So first on the portfolio upgrading. Gahcho Kué delivered on time and budget. Grosvenor completed its first longwall at the end of last year. During the changeover, Seamus and the team corrected some technical problems with the hydraulic supports. We've started in the new year with a second longwall and so far, so good. 
Minas-Rio, 26th of January is a very important date in terms of our Stage 3 licensing. During the course of this year, we'll complete the preparation for the next phase of expansion. We require a confirmation that we've built the asset consistent with the Stage 3 license at the end of the year, and that will help us then start the next phase of ramp up through '19 into '20. 
On disposals and closures, we've done a lot of cleanup work through the year, and you will see some of those transactions confirmed in January. And I think that demonstrates that continuing focus on making sure that it's the focus on the assets, the focus on margins, the focus on continuous improvement, that's where we're going with in terms of all the assets. But I want to be clear. We like what we have in terms of the assets. And now we're focused on making our current businesses improve in terms of their margins and their performance in terms of delivery of returns. 
As a consequence of the focus on asset quality, and again, I make the point that it's about the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, we have a business that is diversified by commodity and by geography. Our job, as a leadership team, is to bring the capabilities that we have within the business to bear on those assets and, with the unique nature of the portfolio, provide what we think is a very unique value proposition to our shareholders. 
And consistent with the geographic conversation, I should make a couple of points on South Africa. In the last 3 years, we've gone through major restructuring of all our businesses in South Africa. We've gone from 31 assets to 17 assets. And with the efficiency improvements that we've also delivered across the portfolio, our EBITDA margin's around 35%, we generated $2.3 billion free cash flow last year and we delivered a healthy return on capital employed of 23%. 
We're encouraged with the leadership changes in the country. And certainly, we're encouraged with the hand that the President has offered to the industry. The deferral of the court case around the Mining Charter, I think's a very important development. And so from our point of view, we're very focused on working across the portfolio and with the government and with other stakeholders to make sure that our South African business remains competitive and continues to improve. 
South Africa is like all other jurisdictions. From our point of view, we want policy certainty and that we make sure that we're doing the right things in the country to make sure that we've got a competitive industry. And when it can be demonstrated we can make returns in the country, then investment follows. It's a very simple thesis and one that drives our behavior across the global portfolio. 
In terms of capital allocation, Stephen has outlined our broader approach to capital and how we think about capital. I'd like to add some further shape to that conversation, dealing with both discipline and our allocation priorities. Our track record over the last 5 years has been one of discipline and delivery. And we're determined to repeat that in terms of the next 5 years. 
One statistic that I think is very important to reflect on, in 2012, our sustaining capital was $2.9 billion. In 2017, it was $1.8 billion. And our production was actually 9% higher than it was in 2012. And yes, there's always a bit of lumpiness in some of those capital numbers. But from a sustaining position, the efficiencies we've improved -- or we've achieved in our capital spend reflect the efficiencies we've achieved throughout the operations with the application of the operating model. 
On the portfolio, the focus, again, is on asset quality. Second, any expansion object -- or any expansion proposal that we look at is subject to intense competition for capital and is scrutinized against strict investment criteria at each stage gate.
In copper, we've got significant growth options both inside the assets that we've got operating today and with our greenfields potential in the Quellaveco. We like the commodity, we like the resources we've got, we like the assets we've got. And we believe we've got the potential to continue to improve the copper business. 
On De Beers, as you would expect, we continue to supply to market demand. And as we see demand growing, we have the capacity to respond to the market in a sensible way without significant capital allocation. 
On platinum, we're still in the business improvement journey. And we're in a market that doesn't require more products. So the focus has to be on continuing efficiency drives and incremental improvements, and that journey is continuing. 
On bulks, we've developed Kolomela, Grosvenor and Minas over the last few years. There's been significant capital outlaid, so today, we're working hard to continue to improve our margins, make sure those assets are delivering on their potential. And whilst we'll continue to spend money on incremental improvements, that business is playing a very important role in generating significant cash, helping us with our debt and it certainly has turned out to be a great decision on making sure that we stayed focused on value and kept the quality of the assets. And from our perspective, the team has done a great job in delivering on the expectations that we saw and the ability that we see -- or the potential we see in those assets. 
Now continuing with the capital allocation theme, I think it's important to make a few points in respect of important markets from our point of view. We will allocate capital to De Beers if the demand is there for our products. We certainly have incremental improvement opportunities that we'll encourage and support Bruce to pursue. But in terms of understanding the business and where it sits, I'll give you a sense of how we think about the business. 
On trading conditions, recent condition -- or recent indicators are the trading conditions, particularly in the U.S., are pretty strong although we also see opportunities in other markets. 
One of the most standout features of what we've seen in the market over the last 18 months is the amount of diamonds that millennials are buying and the 45% represents the amount of diamonds bought by millennials in our 4 most significant markets. People say that maybe buying patterns are changing. Well, from our point of view, millennials are our single most important buyers of our product. 
And so I think from our point of view, that's a great outcome and certainly shows that people are still buying diamonds for engagement rings, but they're also buying diamonds to celebrate other significant events in their life. And they're looking for something that's special, that's unique and that says something special about the event and the person which they're celebrating that event with. 
The other significant change in the market dynamics is that self-purchases by women are growing. And a few years back, it was around 22%. Today, 33%. So the autonomy and the change in the demographics in purchasing behaviors is very much related to women. And certainly, from our point of view, the work Bruce and the team have done in terms of the UN female conversations and positioning the business in a different -- very different way have been very effective in the marketing certainly. 
On geographic demand, again, the U.S. remains our most important market. And certainly, in the last 3 months, we've seen encouraging trends. We'll continue to commit to marketing expenditures. And from our point of view, we think that's very important in making sure that we promote our goods and see growth in the market. 
And on the other side of the coin in terms of synthetics, I think certainly deserve a comment as we've had a few questions from people in the market. The way I think to characterize synthetics is they're a very different market offering. They compete in a different market, whether it be with crystal or other products such as costume jewelry. 
From our point of view, it's important that we continue to differentiate the value proposition for a diamond. It's unique. It's rare. And from our point of view, that proposition still holds. The responsibility of us at De Beers and the industry is to make sure that, that proposition is continued to be articulated in a very clear way. 
On PGMs and electrification of the drivetrain, certainly, something that we're aware of and watching very carefully. But let's put it into context. The drivetrain or the small vehicle, electric vehicles or the small diesel vehicles in Europe represent about 15% of the market for our products. 
The overall growth in demand for vehicles continues to outweigh the switching from diesel to small-scale electric vehicles. We expect that those trends will hold reasonably well up to 2030. The question we have in our minds is how much will fuel cells play into that market and counterbalance and drive growth across the sector. 
Certainly, as an industry, we have to do more to promote our products, but from our point of view, we think the prognosis for our products is very solid over the next few years. And in terms of the longer-term, hydrogen and fuel cells will be the game changer. We're just not sure of the timing. 
So we have to make sure that we remain and continue to move to the left of the cost curve in our industry. And we think, from our perspective, there are a lot of things that we can manage and improve and certainly help demand prognosis for us in the industry. 
Consistent with our overall thesis on quality of assets, in all markets, we see challenges to the demand for our products. The good thing about our position, particularly with the Mogalakwena, is that even today, where people would say it's a pretty tough market for PGMs, we'd delivered a 54% margin in 2017. And when you look at the character of our revenues, 40% platinum, 40% palladium and over time, base metals and other products will play a more important role in the revenue stream. 
So 54% margin off a diversified revenue mix is a very important position. And we've still got a lot of improvement that we can deliver through the operating improvement programs that we see and the application of new technologies that both Chris and Tony are working on across the asset. 
Amandelbult, significant resource, needs to continue to improve its cost. Chris is targeting a 25% cost reduction. That will be important in terms of our business, focused on both safety and productivity. 
Our processing operations, arguably, the most efficient in the industry, delivering a stable 9% margin. We need to continue to improve to make sure we stay there. But for us, we think we're very well positioned in the industry, drive to the left, protect your margins. And the long-term prognosis is pretty good when you think about the new technologies in fuel cell and hydrogen that are going -- that could impact us in a very positive way. 
Again, capital allocation, bulks. We've been very targeted in the way we've developed the bulks portfolio. In going from 68 assets down to 37 assets, we did sell a number of coal and smaller-scale assets. So today, we have niche positions, Kumba, Minas-Rio, metallurgical coal, quality assets, good margins, and we continue to improve our performance in each one of those areas. 
Seamus and Peter are partners in positioning those products at the top end of the revenue scale. And so as a consequence, our margins in those businesses are challenging the lower-cost, lower-quality producers out of the Pilbara. And for us, margins drive returns. So making sure we keep our capital allocation tight, we drive our revenues and our costs, and our margins and returns are challenging the major players in the industry. 
Again, I've got to acknowledge the bulks team. They've been through a tough time in the last 3 years, but the performance that they've delivered while going through some uncertainty has been exceptional and the fact that we've kept those assets is a reflection of the great work they've done in improving the cost and efficiencies across the business. 
With an asset suite of around 35 assets, we've got lots of opportunities to improve the business on an incremental basis. That is small-scale capital, quick-return projects that add cash flow and returns to the business. 
A couple of examples, Moranbah, Grosvenor, by de-bottlenecking the processing plant, we get ourselves another 25% capacity, continues to help improve our cost position. It's a no-brainer at $200 million. 
In De Beers, some of our highest-value diamonds are delivered from our Marine operations in Namibia, another ship, less than a 3-year payback, again a very strong business case that Bruce and the team are developing. 
We have a number of other options across the portfolio, copper, De Beers, PGMs, Mogalakwena, met coal, a number of options that we can kick into place depending on market demand and the margins that we see can be delivered from those assets. So again, an exciting range of portfolio options across the business. 
In terms of greenfields, Quellaveco remains a very important resource in the context of Anglo American. We're currently finalizing our feasibility work. So we're going through the verification processes post the feasibility. We expect to bring the project to the board for review at the midyear.
It's a significant resource. We believe there are significant additional resources that could be added to improve the 30-year life that we see today, potentially doubling that life. The current estimates on operating cost, around $1.10 a pound. And we've done a lot of work in de-risking the asset both from a geotechnical point of view. All of the key permits are in place. We've built our relationship with the local community. We've built our relationship with the government. And certainly, from our point of view, we're doing the final work, so that we can bring the project to the board the middle of the year. 
We would expect during the course of the year to make a final decision, but I certainly don't want to preempt the decision the board would make. And so again, we are planning to take the project to the board midyear. If there's work to be done to complete, I wouldn't expect it to be significant. So during the course of the year, we'd expect to be moving forward. 
The syndication of the project is also an important principle or important point to make. We believe it's appropriate for these types of projects to bring in partners that add value, that can support the development of these types of projects, both from a risk point of view and to bring value forward. 
So in syndicating or thinking about syndication would be on the basis of value. So getting that balance right is something that we'll talk to the board, and we are talking to the board about as a part of the process. 
Over the last 5 years, we've restructured the business. I talk about an 80% productivity improvement. Half of that productivity improvement has come from portfolio changes. Half of that productivity improvement's come from actual underlying efficiency improvements. 
We expect to continue to improve the business. As Stephen said, we've identified $3 billion to $4 billion worth of cost and volume improvements that we'd expect to deliver by 2022. Now that's a run rate number. So for us, we still see a lot of opportunities to improve. 
On the continuous improvement front with our operating model, we'd expect most assets to improve in the range 3% to 5% a year. And certainly, we're factoring some of those improvements in our numbers. 
On a broader front, the technical team, led by Tony and with the business unit leaders, we've got loftier ambitions in terms of step changes. They will tend to be a little back-end loaded given the innovation work and where we are progressing with energy, water, the concentrate, the mine, coarse particle flotation, but they certainly -- they will certainly start making a contribution inside that time frame. 
Embedded in a culture of continuous improvement, every person in the business is responsible for identifying and improving their part of the business. And for us, it's a way of life and an everyday conversation across the business. So we're confident we can deliver at least $3 billion to $4 billion worth of run-rate improvement over the next 3 to 5 years. 
With that type of culture, the quality of the portfolio is important. And one measure of quality and potential we have is that we've got a life-of-mine average across those assets of around 30 years. 
Our job in the next 5 years is to continue to identify improvements and work that potential so that every year, we're getting better across the asset suite. It also provides us with the flexibility to think about where we are in the market and make judgments inside those assets in terms of the best way to operate them under various market conditions. 
That's not about high-grading assets; that's just about making sure we're delivering on their potential and responding to market conditions, which is a lot tougher when you've got high-cost assets. 
And with that, we believe with the internal opportunities we have, we can continue to grow profitable production around 16% over the next 5 years. And that includes continuous improvement on some of those projects that I've talked about in terms of opportunities. 
So finally, in terms of our investment proposition, we characterize Anglo American today first off the asset base. We've got a portfolio of high-quality assets that have the potential to continue to improve as we get smarter. Second, we've built the people capabilities to get the best out of those assets. And three, we've instilled an operating and capital discipline that understands our job is to deliver cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis. 
We've put ourselves in a position where we don't have to do anything outside our portfolio to continue to improve or provide you with quality enhancement opportunities. 
So with that, very happy to take questions."

The permits weren't in place. And we underestimated the project cost. A number of errors, and I'm just saying we've turned that upside down and inside out to make sure we've understood every lesson that can be learnt. And that process has been very thorough. On Minas-Rio today, the license -- the final license has remained a constraint on the footprint for the mine. So that Stage 3 license has been very important to us. So the -- with the completion of the license process, we can then step out the mine and mine at the 26.5 million tonne rate. So now it's just physical constraint on the footprint. If you remember the Samarco incident, anything that had anything to do with the tailings dam in Brazil became an issue. And so we lost probably 18 months, Seamus, on that final approval as a consequence of Samarco. So we've got through that process. It's not finished. But certainly, I think the key point to make is the technologies that we've used for the tailings dam at Minas-Rio is very different to the Samarco. It's a downstream lift, so it's a different engineering principle. So that's the key issue. Now going into Quellaveco, as I said, the learnings have been applied. At Quellaveco, we have all of our major permits. We've been through all of the process with the locals, with the government, very supportive of the project. We've gone 3 times back through the engineering. We're doing a final external review. And if anything, they're arguing that we may have been a little bit conservative in the process, that's good news, but let's wait and see what the final outcome is in terms of the review. All of the project disciplines have been renewed. And under Tony and the team and between Tony and Duncan and their teams, we've pulled apart the organization and reconstructed the business. In the last 5 years, against all of the major projects that we had when I started back in 2013, we've delivered all of those projects on time for $1 billion less than the estimate I gave you back in 2013. So the disciplines are there, the learnings have been applied, we've got a different team looking at this business. This is a different business and the approach to a Quellaveco is very different to what would you have seen with Minas-Rio."

Inventories, in fact, were probably a little bit higher than we'd hoped in a couple of areas, so. In Kumba, and in met coal in particular, we couldn't quite get all the tonnes to the ports that we wanted. But offsetting that was probably a really positive moving creditors, which is probably a little more than what people were expecting. And one of the bigger things in that has been the prepayment that we have through the platinum business increased again this year, and also some of the change in the arrangements as we have moved some of the operations and joint ventures into sort of processing of concentrates and POC contracts. You've seen that translate into some working capital movements as well. So listen, I'm pretty comfortable with where it is, from a working capital point of view, but I wouldn't be banking on major, major steps forward from that, from a dollar point of view. On the tech front, so yes, there's a couple of timing things; probably the major one I'd point out would be met coal in Australia. We will probably have a bit of a -- probably about a $400 million pool pick up, I think, towards the tail end of 2018. And that's just timing, as we have come out of constructions and lower prices into profits. So that will true itself up through 2018. On CapEx, so again, just a reminder, our original guidance was $2.5 billion. Our guidance into next year is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Again, carryover from '17, FX and some additional projects that we've either brought on or kept, are probably the main influences. The majority of the CapEx though, is really around stay-in business, pre-stripping and mine development. So they're really the key things that we're focused on. And some of that's really the continuation of the projects we've already got in play. So Venetia Underground is a great example. That's probably about the major point was this year and next year in terms of expansion of LifeX, top capital. But there's still some work to do in met coal, in terms of, as we get ready for the next long hauls and all that sorts of things. So it's a combination. It's broadly spread. So nothing odd particularly, sort of pull out there. Mark, I'm going to let you to comment on dormant production, but obviously the switch in Venetia from an open pit to underground plays out in sort of years 3 to 4 as well."

What Bruce is doing at the moment is looking in the sequencing of some of the other operations, to see that if that demand remains strong, what he can do to bring a bit more production forward to get more balance in the second year. But I think you're going to go with the guidance as it is today, knowing that Bruce and the guys are working hard to watch the demand carefully.

And we look at 2 moving parts: Firstly, reducing our cost so that we are actually doing better than inflation on a global basis. And we've done a pretty good job of that. In fact, our unit costs on a nominal basis are down 26% over the 5 years. Clearly, inflation is becoming a bigger issue, but we've to deal with inflation in the jurisdictions we're in, over the years, whereas others have got a little bit of a free kick with deflation in Australasia now, and they've also had depreciating currency. So maybe that's starting to turn. So on that basis, we might get a more level playing field in looking forward. We don't want to rely on rising commodities because the one thing that comes with inflation is better commodity prices. We don't want to rely on that. We want to do better than inflation in improving our cost structure. So on a real basis, you're chasing 3% to 5% a year. That's where that 3% of 5% continuous improvement number is very important. Secondly, you want to try and run faster than your competitors. So there are 2 imperatives that we talk about on a monthly basis.

Yes, sorry. And we've forecast something similar, although we start to ramp up during the course of next year off that. And then, we start hitting our straps in 2020. In terms of the approvals, there's a process that we can go through, to try and bring a little bit of our movement forward, to try and mitigate imbalanced production, but we won't forecast that. That's an opportunity not yet realized. So there's work going on to look at bringing things forward, but I think the safe thing at the moment is to forecast that flat production as we have done in the forecast. On Quellaveco, we already have a partner. We will only syndicate for value. I think that's important. From our point of view, that's where we'd prefer to be. Asyndication. We think the right number is in the range 50% to 70%, but at the same time, a lot of debate with the Board about getting that balance right. So I wouldn't like to preempt anything other than to say, we believe we'll syndicate somewhere in that range. It's a great project.

I think in terms of observations, let me say the first thing, it's interesting that -- and we had a Board meeting this week, as you'd expect. It's interesting that the Board delightfully continues to challenge itself and beat itself up about what are doing everything we can and we're doing the right thing. But it's interesting, if you come in new and you look back, this business really is a fundamentally different business than it was 5 years ago. I think that really does need to be remembered. Therefore, what are the priorities? I think first of all, whatever happens to the market, whatever happens to prices, whatever happens at the various commodity areas, the one thing that you can never excuse yourself on, is not doing everything you can which is in your control. And I think this annual drumbeat of continuing to drive cost, efficiency, productivity improvements, volume improvements by actually running our mines the best way we now can, we know how, better than the previous year and better than the competition is an annual drumbeat. And I think that's a really, really important thing to do. I think the other thing, I would say, is safety and environmental is so crucial to the mining industry. And that's from somebody who's coming new in. I'm very familiar with the manufacturing environment, but you can't choose where these mines are. They are where they are. So the environmental and their kind of community engagement thing is just so fundamental to success. And I was pleased to see Mark talking very early on about how disappointed we are in our safety performance. That step change remains to be required. In terms of priorities going forward, other than those, run things the best you can. I think we have to look at our business through an asset lens. And assets include mines, also brands. And that's the most important thing, you can -- it's clear to me, you can't market or talk your way out of a fundamental cost curve problem. So I think driving all of our assets regardless of which commodity they happen to sit in, to the left, and continuing to invest in those, which can be brought there, and can stay there, is key. They will therefore result in us being in the commodities we're in. And we will be, and continue to be a successful, diversified mining -- major mining company. And that's kind of -- few words from me."

Clearly the resource endowment is enormous, but the company doesn't seem to be fully in control, because the local extension that the [indiscernible] requires the corporation of Quellaveco to go through that wall between the 2 mines, and clearly, for Collahuasi you need to convince Glencore that is a good idea. And they have plenty of growth elsewhere. So why would they commit more capital? How do you extract yourself from this kind of slight dilemma? And secondly, on diamonds, I'm a bit confused. So when we talked about these last 2 years, the capability was always put at 36 million to 37 million carats from a production perspective. I understand we may be talking about 32 now, because it's so far out, and you don't give guidance that far out. So how should I look at that gap of 5 million?

And, in fact, we know where those numbers are. What he is doing is making sure that we've got some flexibility in how we respond to the market. Because we don't want to bring that capacity on today, when the market's still reasonably well balanced. So it's a phasing issue as opposed to an absolute quantity issue, first point. Two, on copper, we're in and have been in very constructive conversations with CODELCO around the [indiscernible]. Those conversations continue. One of the difficult issues we have is that with the change of government, the senior management of CODELCO changes, but they're certainly been a good base established now, so we're going to continue working that through, and we think that's important. And we think there is a pathway there. On Collahuasi, we believe there's still a lot more improvement available, and we acknowledge the team's effort, Duncan, in terms of the improvements they've made. We want to keep seeing improvement, but we also believe, with the technical work Tony and Duncan are working on, there are some compelling new technologies that will really shape a different future for our copper business in Chile. And we think those arguments, but that need major capital leaks, in terms of delivery of improvement, by reduced water consumption, which is a no-brainer in that sort of environment. So we think, any partner we have in an asset that is sensible and rational and wants to make a lot in terms of returns, would consider those opportunities, but it's up to us to build the case, and we think we can."

When you say it quickly, it doesn't sound like much. And as Tony pointed out, it was a fairly significant change, which took about 2 years to execute. As a consequence, that's been the major shift. And the focus on equipment productivity, I think, we're up by a factor of 150% on our major shovels now. So the reason we're delivering additional tonnage is: one, the big change in the mine; and two, the underlying productivities of the equipment, we're operating track, it used to be 4,000 hours a year, it's now 6,000 hours, so our sustainable capital is also going down. So it's sustainable right -- it's a sustainable right pull. I think the life of mine is 13 to 15 years, Duncan? What Tony and Seamus and the team are working on now, what are the new technologies to try and enhance that resource space and build more life in the asset. So that's where the focus is now, Paul, and continuing cost reduction. We've got a great product. We get a lump premium, and our margins are matching the Pilbara as we speak today.

It's a separate entity and involves banks, but there are no relationships with our business. And in fact, the financial reporting transparency piece that we have put in place is designed to identify and help us identify where those things may have occurred. And so, there's been a big change in De Beers out of the last 15 years, as you know. So they're not connected to us. Two, the mood generally has been pretty good. I think most importantly, the U.S. selling season was very positive. And the mood coming back has been quite strong. There are always a few that may be struggling for different reasons, but so far, the feedback has been good, and certainly, encouraging from our perspective, and again looking forward where we're cautious and slightly optimistic. I've learned in this business not to get too excited by one or two sites, so. But so far, so good. And certainly, the feedback's been pretty solid.

The industry needs more mines. I think, as an industry, the key is investing in new demand. And I think the commitment ourselves have made, and are also to the creditors made, those programs are going to be very important in making sure our product is front and center in terms of consumer choices.

In the end, we've learned a lot of lessons from Minas-Rio. We've applied those lessons to the project. But at the same time, we don't know what we don't know, irrespective the amount of work we do. The oil and gas industry worked out a long time ago, with these types of bets were near this lumpy, best to share that risk. So it's a strategic choice in the first instance. And we've made that point a number of times, and we'll keep making that point. Because Minas-Rio was also a 100% bet. It would have been a lot more easy to handle if we had shared some of that risk. And so again, we've got Duncan and Tony and the guys, absolute brilliant work on Quellaveco, but there are still things we don't know, we don't know. So it is strategic. And I think, secondly, when we've got capital -- when we've got the business, the allocation model is absolutely critical. So debt, dividend, investment in the right places, and every dollar of capital goes through a stringent justification, competition stage guiding process. I'll keep saying it, because it's a disciplined we as an industry haven't demonstrated to our shareholders. And for 5 years, we've been there and we're going to stay there. South Africa? I do owe 1 back here, but I'll go to South Africa, if I can take South Africa."

I think we're going to do a little bit of that diversity to go as in the script. Welcome, thanks for joining us this morning. I would like to acknowledge few of my colleagues this morning before I start. Chairman, Stuart Chambers, welcome, sir. My colleagues on the management committee sprinkled through the audience, and we've also got Tom who is the Project Executive for Quellaveco. He is joining us today. I think he is plan to Peru; and Ruben Fernandes. Ruben's fresh from where he has been cleaning the pipeline. So I'm sure he will be happy to have a chat with couple of you during the course of the morning; and a few of my other colleagues, I see as well. 
So can I encourage all of you to take advantage of having a few people around, you can ask whatever questions you want. And hopefully, we can provide you with the insights you need to help understand where we are, where we've come from and where we're going.
Today, we'll stick pretty well with the format. I'll talk about business performance just given talk about where we've come in terms of the last 5 years, some of the work we've done positions of the business. Stephen will talk about the financial results and unpack the numbers, which I think is very important. So there is a few moving parts here in the set of results that need to be explain. I'll pick up again on capital allocation, obviously the conversation around Quellaveco is an important part of that conversation and really does reflect our focus on a different approach to the way we allocate capital. And then just pick up some details on the foundations that we have created and why we believe we set ourselves up for the next 5 years and look quite different to where we've been the most importantly though, I think, talking about the lessons we've learned as of last 5 years and how those lessons are being implied into how we think about on how we will execute continuing improvement journey that we're focused on over the next 5 years. 
And with that, we'll kick straight into performance. From an operating performance point of view, continuing improvement in the operations performance. Our $400 million improvement in the first half reflects that half of that $800 million commitment for the full year, again Stephen will unpack those numbers just to help you understand where we've got that from. 
Earnings and cash flow reflect continuing improvement in the business, our EBITDA also up 11%. Attributable free cash flow, when you pull apart the one-offs compared to last year is pretty solid, but we need to continue to improve. On margins and returns, we've improved our EBITDA margin to 41% and our return on capital employed is 19%. So it's a solid set of results, more we can do and certainly we're focused on continuing the trends to improve and make sure we've got the business that can deliver consistently.
On safety, health and environment, important place for us to start. Unfortunately, we've reported 2 fatalities in the first half and in fact we had a third fatal incident in July. So still a lot of work to be done. We have improved. But from my point of view, we've done good set of results until we're at 0. And so that continues the illumination of task force work starting to get the real momentum. So I think we're in the middle of impacting that performance and certainly a 31% improvement in the total frequency rate for the half is encouraging, but nowhere near where we want to be. 
So encouragement, but a lot more work to be done. Health, the numbers are good. We continue to focus on a broad range of issues with our work force. On the environmental side, again a solid set of results, but I would say the disappointment, obviously Minas-Rio of the 4 incidents that we reported in the first half, the Minas-Rio 2 of those incidents, lot of work going on now. As we stand today, we are in the middle of the process of inspecting the pipe. We are setting up to replace of around 4 kilometers of pipe. So that's been ordered. That's all been done. The preparation work has been done. We're working with the authorities to make sure that we've got appropriate independent advice and that we're connecting to the authorities so that the appropriate regulatory approvals move through fairly quickly. So we're still on track to start producing again by the end of the year, but there is a fair bit of work to be done and to make sure that we fully understand the mechanism. We believe we do, but I want to wait til all of the inspections have been done to make sure we got every angle covered. So a lot of work going on, and again both and Ruben are here, if you would like to understand a little bit more after our sessions. You're more than welcome to check with the guys.
On productivity and improvement, generally through the operations, as you know, productivity continues to improve. For us, volumes are up 8% over the last 5 years, and the key number, obviously, number of assets. So when we talk fairly drastic action in either closing or selling assets, we called out about 15% to 17% of our productive capacity. So the fact that we are up 8%, reflects improved performance from the existing assets. And on an average, it's about 30% uplift in performance across the existing asset or the current asset suite. We've also had a couple of contributions from assets coming into the mix growth. And for example, but there is still no yet at full capacity. So our productivity should continue to improve over the course of the next 18 months. And for us, that's very important, because we continue to improve our operating cost and our competitive positions. 
On numbers, in terms of people, there has been a significant reduction. We've gone from about 160,000 down to 95,000. We will continue to tighten the cost structure within the business so those numbers will continue to reduce, but we're making sure that we do that with all of our employees, but that's where the focus is to continue to improve our cost position.
I just wanted to give a little bit of sense or to give you a little sense of what does an average 30% improvement look like across the business. So this slide is a slide around Mogalakwena. It could easily be It could be Moranbah. It could be Gahcho Kué. It could be Kolomela. It could be Los Bronces, you get the picture. So at Mogalakwena, on mining, our Cheryl productivities have gone from 1,700 to 2,300. There is still a long way to improve, the last 5 where 5% -- 34%, sorry, and we still see significant performance potential in the assets, but that's going encouraging in terms of the underlying mixed productivities across the group. 
On truck utilization, we're up 20%, almost 20%. So actually at 20%. Now we've gone from 5,400 hours per truck the 6,500 hours per truck. So it also helps explain why our sustaining capital numbers have been improving as well. So we're getting more out of the assets we have. 
In terms of the concentrators and tonnes processed, we're up 35% and so thus we've improved the concentrated in We did from incremental volumes with but overall the underlying efficiency improvements in our operations is north of 20%. Again that's very important, and not $1 of capital is being spent on any of those improvements. 
At the same time, we've gone from 74% recovery with payable material to 80% recovery. So the volumes are up. And without putting new storage or other capacity in, we've been able to improve our underlying recoveries by 8%. So that's straight to the bottom line. So that's been significant. So we're improving, but the volumes and quality of the work has been done. As a consequence, that improvement and with the way we set the up, and if you can recall 3 or 4 years ago, we talked about rescheduling the over the next 15 years, we've got some improvements in gray. And when you add that all that up together, we've seen a 60% increase in production of precious metal. 
So we're now at around 1 million ounces of precious metals. We talk about platinum, but for us, it's about all the payables and that's north of 1 million ounces payable. Today, our margin is 45%, even though the platinum prices dropped 30%. That's been significant and the real story, and this all adds up to -- and this is equivalent platinum cost. We've gone from $994 back in 2012 to $250 an ounce. So Chris's target is 0 platinum cost is alive and well. There is still a lot of potential, and we think we can get there. Obviously, grade will play some part in that. But from our point of view, 75% reduction, or if you want to talk margins, we've gone from a 40% margin to 45% margin, despite a 30% reduction in the prices of products we produce. And that's really a big part of the story in terms of getting platinum from net $1.5 billion debt to a net cash position at the half-year. So in a pretty strong place, and so very pleased with that. And again that's a number of assets that I could talk to in those same terms a full portfolio.
Importantly, it's improving our competitive position across our commodities. So in 2013, the best data we have for the business 2014. But if you look at the positions across the quartile cost curves, these are the positions by commodity that we occupied back in 2013, '14. So as a consequence of portfolio, operating efficiencies and sort of new the innovation stuff that we're starting to think of it and introduced into the operation, which became a bigger part of the story in the next 5 years. We started to see improvements in our relative position. So this means we're moving quicker in those areas, where you see we're going to the right in terms of cost positions relative to competitors. So has gone from 71% to [ 57% ]. Quellaveco being Q1 will take us mid Q2. And so again very important addition to the portfolio in terms of the quality of the copper business. 
Met coal, Moranbah, in particular, will start to make a significant contribution and Grass Tree has taken us to the top of the league table in terms of long wall operations moving us again to the left. done a great job in the Met Coal business. In De Beers, general focus on cost making a good contribution. So again moving to the left with more to be done. 
In platinum, you know the Mogalakwena story, but we are improving other assets, including Amandelbult, a lot more to be done in those assets and a lot more potential still at Mogalakwena, but a good shift to the left. In nickel, the furnaces sorted out from what we can judge in the Nickel business now is the one of the very few major new nickel assets that are actually hit the design capacity. And if you remember the problems, we had with the furnaces, very furnaces and now at full rate and again, Ruben has been the leader of the business for some years now and is probably the best in control asset that we got across the group. And we got a lot of success stories, but in terms of nickel, those furnaces are really starting to set the trend and the benchmark for us as a business to following terms of running an asset well. 
In story not as positive. We pulled up capital with our partners on the base that we didn't think it was the right time or we weren't spending that capital as well we could. So we've pulled a bit to the right. We've also got 2 assets, getting close to end of life. So that's impacted the cost as of the next 3 to 4 years, they will come to start of the system. So we'll move again to the left, but there is more work to be done on productivity and Sheamus can talk about some of the things we've been working on the chemical, in particular, in South Africa. 
In iron ore, you guys know the story pretty well, a lot of new capacity in the Pilbara and in Brazil has been built. So the to the right. In our case, we more than halfed our controllable cost at Kumba. But even with that, we've not been able to complete at this level, but we've closed the gap to the Pilbara and Brazil. And in fact, I think 3 of the months last year towards the end of the year, where premium quality were pretty good. We are actually middle in Q2. So for us the target is $10 a tonne either through premiums and cost, that would give us a 35 breakeven landed in China gets us in this So and the guys and know what has to be done in the next 3 to 5 years, that's where in pursuit of trying to get ourselves on the bottom half of the cost curve. 
at full rate is mid-Q2 as well by strong quality and cost around 35 landed in China. So there's work to be done. We know what we got to do, but there is still more to be get ourselves to the left-hand side of the Cosco. So today 2018, we've moved from 52 percentile to 46 percentile. We have a view on how we done against our competitors. We've done well, we think, but it's a constant analysis from our point of view because we got to keep trying ourselves to the left. So in each of those businesses, we know what we got to do to get ourselves to the left. We got to try and get quicker than our competitors, and that's the imperative, that's the focus and that's what I'll talk about when I talk about things a little bit later in terms of the 5 years. So today, if you remember, we are predominantly here. We've moved a lot of the businesses into the second quartile, but we still got more work to do. And certainly, we know how to get there in copper and and the guys are very focused on getting us in iron ore as well.
As a consequence, from 2012, we're up to 41% margin. That is against a lower price deck for our commodities. So a 23% reduction in cost, which is in a nominal number or about 30% real has helped us move of the margin curve. And we know, and that includes, I should say, also includes the marketing work So that's been important in terms of our margins. Over the next 5 years -- 3 to 5 years, we will continue with the efficiency work. Our innovation and technology work is set to make a more significant contribution in the 3- to 5-year range.  And again Tony can describe some of the things we've got going. And with obviously with Quellaveco and the smaller projects that we're starting to put under the launching pad, there is a real push that head us towards the 50% type margin. Clearly, subject to price. But on an apples-to-apples basis, we know where we are got to go what we are driving towards. 
So with that, I'll hand it to Steve. You want to pack the numbers?"

So it's a really good set of numbers. It's a clean set of numbers. Importantly, it sort of simply shows where we are focusing our efforts as we run the business, and as we prioritize the things that we want to do internally. And those priorities really continue around the balanced approach. So it's a balanced approach around returns to shareholders, capital allocation and ongoing focus on the balance sheet. And the same themes that you saw in the last 6 months prior, you see in these 6 months, and you will see again in the next 6 months, the journey continues. We will also unpack a little bit about the EBITDA drivers and will finish on the report card that we talked to you.
So we speak a lot about our focus on cost and volume. The reason we do that is because we know from time-to-time a different parts of the cycle. We will come under pressure from inflation and other sort of cost increases. This half, we delivered $400 million of the $800 million target that we set for this year, and that $400 million takes us to $4.6 billion since 2012. 
What have we seen in terms of some of those cost increases, and we touched on the same a little bit on the full year results. So increased diesel price given the higher price, but as the same for everyone across the industry. Same increased energy prices, particularly stay down in South Africa, and that can reflect electricity prices or in infrastructure charges if those things also use energy. And we've also see a little bit of wages and salary growth again South Africa, South America, in particular. But that's the reason why we stay focus on cost and volume improvement. So we stared of the curve. So let's have a cook talk at this Slide. So we'll move across left to right. So in terms of prices, KGMs up, largely driven by palladium and rhodium.
Copper,  thermal also up. In terms of currency, a little bit mixed bag in terms of currency is probably noticeable was the through the half so the South African Rand through the half, and that softened right towards the end of June 30. Inflation, touched on. Minas-Rio, we'll highlight separately for you through the year so that you can just clearly understand the impact that has first and second half. The good news is we are on track in terms of the inspection and repair work. We some change in terms of coming on at the end of the fourth quarter. And really as we look forward to '19, that delivered a positive momentum into earnings as comes back on 
I just want to step away for a moment from this half's numbers and just a little bit forward as we look at that sort of cost and volume improvement journey that's ahead of us. So you recall that the full year, we outlined our target over the next 5 years from the start of '18 into the end of '22, $3 billion to $4 billion improvement that we're looking for. And there is really 3 broad buckets. So I just want to give a touch a little more detail to help you understand where the focus is. 
So the first bucket is operational efficiency. You will hear us talking internally and probably a little more externally about and this is sort of the catchphrase that we have internally that really talks about getting some benchmark and beyond. So full potential plus sort of another phrase of how we explain it. And even though we've had a great journey in some of the assets, and Mark spoke about before, there is still a real opportunity in front of us. And we've improved Mogalakwena with -- with improved cutting rights and things but we still have real opportunity in front of us to get to benchmark and beyond and really sort of set the trend for the industry. And that's across all the diggers, all the tracks, processing plant, recovery, it's everywhere. We've got that same mentality as we look for those improvement opportunities. 
When you do start to approach you got to start make some choices. How do you take that benefit? Do you take that benefit in terms of cost out? Do you pack up trucks? Do you backup deals? Do you take that benefit in terms of increased production, if you can get it to market down infrastructure? Or is it some combination of both? Is it a focus on grade and quality of products so the maximizing a margin of what you earn for each time? So sort of the choices that we have to make as we go forward, great choices and great opportunities to have to through. It's a really, really great challenge as we look and think about the business all the way from mine to market and think about how we maximize that value equation. 
Second bucket is around technology and innovation. And here I suppose I want to give a sense that we're moving out of the lab and into the field. So we're really have a quiet a schedule as we roll out some of these production test units across some of our operations. Some in the concentrated mine. It's about box sorting. What is that? It's about more precisely getting the grade by separating prior to the main processing plant. The lower grade going to put through the plan. So the aim there is 10% to 20% increase in food grade through the processing plan. We're about to put the first of those units into should be in the end of August, September time frame and then early next year and will be Mogalakwena. And also those things really starting to and roll out across the operations.
In copper, we are probably more certain of the benefit. Platinum still doing some early phase work to make sure we're going to get those sorts of benefits. On particle flotation, sort of we use less energy so the target there is 30% more throughput, a smaller recovery loss, maybe 3%, and that should get us 20%-plus energy, 30% -- less water. And again copper will be the first rollout of that and that will really be to the early half of 2019. 
The third bucket is really about project delivery, and Mark touched on some of those things we've spoken about than before and bottlenecking potentially next of in Quellaveco coming in at the end of 2022. So lots of opportunities in front of us. Again the commitment across the whole organization to change these things are really quite exciting for us and the momentum and enthusiasm that we have got across all of the operations, okay. 
Back to some of some of today's results. My message here is really about stability of the earnings and effectiveness of capital allocation. So from a stability of earnings point of view, 3% increase in EPS, 6% increase in return-on-capital employed to 19%. 
Cash flow, if I can get this Someone able to move the screen for me. Here we go. We're up, thank you. Looking at cash flow. So we did have a really strong 2017. So we did have a number of sort of one-offs benefits the flow through 2017, which are not seeing more normalized level set of cash flow on a half-to-half basis. So last time around some of the one-offs in our cash tax we just restarted they've been forced to have your pick so we had less minority leakage. We had lower CapEx. We had a bit of working capital release in the first half of last year. So a more normalized state this time around. If you normalize for those things, it could increase period-on-period strong cash flow for the half. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Focus on net debt reductions continued, a further $0.5 billion to $4 billion. It remains a priority for us, as I said earlier, and we are determined still to take advantage of this window of opportunity that we have before we had to put our hand in a bucket to CapEx on Quellaveco.
At $4 billion, we are probably really at the low end of -- we're very, very comfortable with where the is for this part of the cycle. So remember I spoke last time around I look at the balance sheet across 3 key metrics. So absolute net debt level, obviously strength of the balance sheet. Net debt-to-EBITDA strength of the underlying cash flow although that can obviously move before volatility and commodity prices and obviously net gearing or net leverage ratios really goes to the heart of the strength of the balance sheet even through that cycles. We will remain focused on all 3. Our guidance for the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of 1x to 1.5x. We don't want to exceed that for any long period and through the lows of the cycle. Obviously, we are incredibly levels as we should be asked for this part of the cycle. Ideally, we want to set this balance sheet so that we can become cyclical if opportunities emerge in the years ahead.
So in terms of returns to shareholders, we're committed to the payout policy, 40% of underlying earnings per share, $0.49 for the period, slightly nonstop from where we were in the prior half. So there's different states returns to shareholders to $1.9 billion since we raised the dividend this time last year. That's about 4% yield. Just to but I think going to raise prices. So just to wrap it up then how do we go in terms of our report card. So prior to discretionary capital, $1.8 billion of cash flow. What we do with that? Net debt down $0.5 billion, final dividend the $700 billion in terms of -- $700 million in terms of returns to shareholders and for other bits and pieces. Discretionary capital $200 million for the half. Obviously, that will take up a little bit and through the second half  2019. So as I say, continued journey, continued trends, a good journey that we are on. Mark, back to you."

For us, when we look at the business we talk about the commodity position, I'd like to stress the point that the positions we have by commodity our function of our focus on quality assets. It's our focus on quality assets that determines where we put our capital and where we develop. The good news for us in copper, the fundamentals are strong. We've got a great position, and we're able to convert that opportunity and something very real with Quellaveco and many pursuing copper in the industry, we've got some great internal options both from a Greenfield's perspective, a Brownfields perspective and longer-term, we think our exploration work will position us even further in terms of the industry. So great decision to be in.
In terms of -- I'm sorry should have make the decision story. In terms of diamonds, we continue to supply to demand. And as we see demand growing, we've got the ability to flex. We are transitioning in a couple of parts of business, obviously the from open character wondering. So that's a transition story at the moment, I think it's time and certainly continuing improvements obviously and to main important contribution in terms of business and certainly the prognosis is pretty good going forward suddenly very encouraging. 
On PGM, big focus on Mogalakwena and its ability to make continuing improvements and a major or significantly improved contribution. But in particular, for us right at the moment, a lot more work to be done at. And so still continuing hygienic of Cosco. Lot more work to be. Very focus there, and clearly the big contribution for If you look at the number from the last couple of years there have been exceptional.Moranbah, the growth and ramp up continues. So from our point of view, lots of incremental opportunities in that business to improve that contribution and certainly the contribution in the last 2 years has been significant and we will continue to be strong, given the improving performance across the business.
For us, the potential or the focus on portfolio upgrading his company. Obviously, we'll talk about Quellaveco in a couple of minutes. PGMs, union, we completed several continuous our focus on reviewing those assets that can move for us. The Mototolo acquisition should be really sort of taht firstly, we know asset, we know that reserves, the purchase position with of that extending from the 5-year life to a 30-year life with a connection to doesn't that doesn't mean we're going to do anything significant today what it does do is provide as long-term option in terms of the business. It's not the right time in the market to go spend something new in terms of the asset, but positioning us very important in terms of quality assets for the long term, and we see this is a good move. 
Thermal coal, we are aware of the completion of the transactions on the tide mines along with New Largo. In the base, we have been Lightbox, a very important step in terms of the business and again Bruce is here, if you would like a bit more insight into that happy to answer any questions. And obviously the peregrine flags and approach for us that's very important for us, that will be a significant shortfall by 2022. So we are positioning ourselves with the reduction in terms of going into the market. But again it's market lead, make sure, we're doing the right things and spending that money in a smart way.
Quellaveco, some has observed that the photo does indicate we have been active in the last 2 or 3 years. The actual number, Jason, is about $500 million in terms of investment in value in the ground, including the option open. I think it's money well invested in terms of understanding the geotechnical issues, understanding the big issues that you don't know about before you might give commitments and most importantly, it's been an investment in the community and the commitments that we made to the community. So in terms of those relationships, absolutely critical in the place like Peru, and we certainly got the support of the local committee. So it's been an important part of the work. 
On Quellaveco itself, obviously returns, key focus for us making sure we get the discipline right. Internal rate of return works off the midpoint of the range, and we've talked about in terms of the capital, 5 to 5.3. Return on capital employee is not of 20% when we hit that full production rate and through the first 10 years and our payback post first production is a fully years. So for us very important metrics. And if you look at the key hurdles that we set ourselves in terms of our capital allocation projects -- processes 4 years ago, it takes into one of those boxes. 
In terms of the asset itself, low-cost and I'll unpack why the cost is low as they are. Long life, obviously, the resource is significant. We do see significant long-term potential beyond the 30 years. And I think the address in terms of who is next tells you the there is a good story or good potential story in the long-term. Capital discipline, the commitment to the syndication of the partnership with Mitsubishi is very important. And as Stephen indicated, we won't be required to put our hand in our pocket and finding our share and do well into 2019. So that's an important point to make in terms of the balance sheet and our continued journey in reducing our debt. 
In terms of being execution ready, it's permitted. The social credentials is where we had been investing working very hard with the local community very strong, and from the dialogue table in 2012, it's been a real success story in terms of the conversations. Interestingly, the government of, the chair, the round table in 2012 is now the President of the country. And so I think he is probably more excited than we are in terms of the commitment, and we will be standing with him next week talking about that in the context of Peru. So very strong support from the government right the way through the local community, which is something very important in all of our jurisdictions, and particularly Peru.
Again execution ready in terms of the committee support. We've actually committed through the life of the project, $300 million in community investment programs and that's not the investment programs that we think they should have by the of investment programs they've asked us to help them within being as true partner in the committee. And it is different, it's a different approach, it's a different conversation, and we think critical to ensure continuity and cost competitiveness of the project you need your local community in there is a partner. 
Our key permits are in place. The construction program is as good as I have seen in my 42 years in the industry. Clearly, we had a long-term debate this and we've done a lot of the pre-work and we've applied all the lessons that we could place out of our of our previous adventures or misadventures in some cases. So I think it's well set up and well set up the to lead the project Duncan all of the GMC members have been active participants in making sure that we looked at this from every angle.
This indication, I think, was an important message to everyone that we are serious about thinking about a different investment model for the industry. Yes somewhat from the oil and gas sector in terms of sharing that risk. We've got a good partnership with Mitsubishi. We know well them by now and certainly from our point of view, we think it's a win-win for both of us as an organization. We're not going to talk about returns the fact that we've been able to book a profit on some of the investments we have made is actually helped us a return a little bit better IRR return than we're reporting at the project level. So the good news is it actually enhances our returns as well, and we think that's smart to been putting a little while, the profit back in our pocket and using that to help fund the early parts of the progress and keep our balance sheet in good shape and able to support the continuing improvements across other parts of the portfolio. So again we think it's a win-win for us and for all parts of our business.
The returns, very important. You've seen the headline numbers I've talked about. I think the EBITDA margin -- we talked about that 50% target for us as a group. This hopes us achieve that type of improvement in our margins. The construction capital, and this is our share post-syndication in the range $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. I think it's important to focus on well as an Anglo American's financial commitment to building the project. And from our point of view, in 2018, will be around $400 million, fully funded from the proceeds that we received from Mitsubishi and that goes well into '19 as well.
Unit operating cost for the first 10 years, $1.05. In fact with the softer material in the first 5 years, it's a bit below that. The structural cost advantages are important for people to understand it's innovation, below one. Secondly, for the first 10 years most of the whole is downhill. So you've got low-cost costs and the labor cost and the energy cost are very competitive. They are not some would be in other parts of the world. In Peru, it's a developed country. It's a progress in country, productivity is good, the pace is good, but more competitive than some of the other jurisdictions. So from our point of the structural stove this is very good. Hydropower is also an advantage in terms of the energy. So it's a good mix and we're making a good contribution in terms of the organization. And it's also sustainable because the payout rates aer very competitive on a broader basis. Production 300,000 tonne for a year plus 10 years, a little bit higher than the first 5, again as a consequence of this of the material going through the plan. Very quickly. 
Cost position, as we said, we will improve our cost position as a consequence of Quellaveco, who will move solidly into Q2. If you remember the copper position on the So that's an important step for us, again a continuing focus on improving the portfolio.
Can you give us a click on this slide? Thank you. The start of the resource unit, I think the big thing with the copper deposits, we're in great address. So the 2 southern copper assets that flankers have been a long-term assets, very successful assets. And certainly from our point of view, the address is a great address. Mineralisation is pretty well known. And from our point of view, it's open to my death incident in one direction. So we would expect beyond the 40 years from the project. And if you look at the resource pays, obviously, significant. We would like to think it's beyond 60 years, a lot of work to be done, obviously, to prove that sorts of numbers, but significant potential. If you look at history in terms of Los Bronces growth in 2004, same with Collahuasi. We think it's one of the of deposits that becomes a long-term foundation for the group. And so a very important commitment and I think well priced, great returns and for the long-term is a changing or is a portfolio changer for us as a group.
So on the foundations that we've set or have been been setting and with Quellaveco being another step towards building on those foundations, I think it's important to just reflect for a moment that today if you look at where we were 5 years ago, our average life of mine was somewhere between 20 and 25 years. Today, we are at 30 years across the portfolio. Our thermal coal assets, we got the shortest life of about 14 years and some assets have got beyond the 100, Mogalakwena. Our target is in the next 5 years is to make sure. We maintain that life as a minimum. And there are opportunities to increase the life, which will then ultimately underpin future growth in the asset base, again connected to the markets. But with that type of asset base, we're in a unique position and certainly, unique in our industry and it gives us the ability to focus on that the underlying improvement for the long term. So every time we make an improvement, we got 30 years to bring the results and that's critical and that is different in our industry to many of our competitors. 
So we've also got a list of opportunities in each of those commodity positions that provide us with the opportunity to grow, and we are forecasting as Stephen talked about, a 3% growth year-on-year through 2022. And we have the options that go well beyond that type of configuration at that time frame. So it's a for example, something that could follow Quellaveco market condition permitting. But it's a small asset, low capital base, high margins, return. So we've got a number of those types of opportunities across the portfolio. 
Something that we'll start to talk about in the next year or 2 is exploration. Through the tough times in a '15 and '16, we didn't stop committing to exploration and technical innovation. And I think today, we're starting to see the benefits of that commitment in terms of what we're doing on the ground. So in terms of our exploration strategy, timing, the team redefine our approach to expiration, a step back big original positions, think about expiration in a very different way. And so we are focused on key geographies. The innovation work that we're doing now is being applied to our approach to exploration. And for us, it's all about value. And certainly from our point of view, we think the exploration team is starting to show real value for the commitment that we've shown in the last 2 or 3 years, in particular. And today, we've got some really interesting position, For those that have been tracking at you're probably aware that we drilled some holes in Brazil, 6 holes. We stopped. We've actually out fairly substantial man position, I think it's 5x the size of where in Australia, it's backyard. 
It is a significant position. And certainly, from our point of view, it's a very interesting place to be. We think we may be sitting on the periphery, but there is a lot of work still to be done, early days, but we'll keep you posted in terms of the process as to next 6 to 18 months. And our brownfield's opportunity, we've been doing a lot of drilling around Mogalakwena, Los Bronces both from an underground potential and extension to the existing operation and obviously the district. So we're not going to do much more than let you know that this is becoming very important part of our portfolio and the future options that we have. 
Again focus on asset quality as a consequence, revenue by product, quite a mixed bag. So that from our point of view, it really is different, and we are providing different set of options to the marketplace. And in our case, the quality of the assets that in those revenue streams are very strong. So from our perspective, we could get differentiated, it's unique. Capital employed by geography overtime has been balancing pretty well, South Africa 26%, used to be up near 50%. We are getting that balance right, certainly from our point of view, we think that is profiled in terms of the revenue base is starting to balance out quite nicely, and that will continue to balance out over the next 3 to 5 years with the commitment to Quellaveco, certainly improving that balance across key geographies. 
I just that wasn't helpful. In terms of how we are positioning commodities for the future. We are well positioned in electrification and innovation. PGMs, in particular, copper is part of that world. In terms of coal the quality of our coking coal and the quality of our iron ore is playing very much into the China environmental store. We think the premiums on those products will certainly remain as China and other location focus on quality and making sure that it's both efficiency and clean production from those sources. We think that's important and growing middle-class, platinum jewelry, diamonds, those other products, we are playing in the those sector. So again there is a consequence of our differentiation across the portfolio, we're playing into the right market segments in terms of use of raw materials and products. 
And finally, for us, again, it's about assets. We're building the capabilities inside the organization to take advantage of the quality we have inside the asset base. And for us, it's about cash flow, it's about the efficiency of those cash flows as measured in return on capital and that's been sustainable from safety of all the way through to the social contract we have with the partners in developing new opportunities in the business, absolutely critical. And that's the Anglo American story. So I'm very happy to take questions."

Currency is bit of inflation went against is going with about the volume increase and them some byproduct credits also sort of played into that. So a good outcome and has assured me he is going to give delivering for the second half so that, again, I would expect this to come inside our previous guidance. Generally, across the other commodities, as far as the same part of that line mixed impact in terms of currency volumes grade, et cetera, but generally we are inside and tracking inside of our full year guidance for most of the commodities. Coming to that topic CapEx. So we are gaining that we will spend $400 million on a 100% basis for the balance of this -- $300 million to $400 million for the balance of this calendar year. That will be funded from the proceeds, from the sell down. Some of those proceeds will then carry on through into next year. And so on the first 5 is largely through the first half also be funded from those proceeds, and it's really then -- that's called mid-next year that will start to contribute on a 60-40 basis. So if you recall in the announcement of the sell down, it's about $833 million comes in and that's the $500 plus gross up comes into the account. So it's the $834 million that gets funded on the 60-40 basis, if that's correct all sorts of things. We're not guiding at the moment in terms of the exact When we come out with capital guidance for '19, we will give you better spread and those are the things, but it's a fairly typical set of projects planned profile. So years sort of '19 -- years '20, '21 will be the largest relates back in '22 as we get to the end. In terms of dividend policy, we're really happy with the 40% of our guidance and payout ratio. When we struck it, and we still think it strikes the right balance. Now remember for us, it's not about one thing or the other, it's not about capital returns to shareholders and that's what we got to do with the money. We think we struck a really nice balance in terms of appropriate returns to shareholders, sensible capital allocation and investment in the future whether that be longer-term a shorter-term type initiatives and the balance sheet. Our priority to each of those 3 absolutely I'd like to make progress across the balance sheet still for the next 12 months. So we think we got that balance right. Ultimately, we will work our way around that capital allocation well. And if we find ourselves with excess cash as we worked around that we will then we will consider how we allocate it back. Right now, I think, the 40% is really strikes that balance."

And as part of the resolution, monitoring the pipe for changed and being condition is very important because these things don't fail catastrophically, there may be small leak over a period of time and gather space. The key thing will be to monitor by temperature, by moisture, by sound and by vibration and we'll have an early indication, we're making sure that those technologies are part of the fix. So that's why it's taking a bit longer, making sure we understand it and that the fixed covers not only the integrity of the pipeline, but also providing early warnings if we have any issues so that we are in full control of the pipeline and making sure now It's a market pipeline run 6 years without a leak. So we're also understanding those technologies. We got to feel the Samarco to actually working with us. So we got experience with us are working through those potentially solutions well. So again the right technical expertise, we to across-the-board is been applied and we're using the advisers to the prosecutor and the government. And I think again the prosecutor's appreciate the fact that we got that type of expectation on the job. Yes, have in some ways appointed themselves as the protector for the community. But having said that, we are in a very constructive dialogue with the guys. And so from our point of view, they will continue to do that job, our job is to give them comfort we got dishes covered. I think well in that part, where it's not there and yet. There is still couple of operating processes s we's have to go through, and I think the guys are doing everything they should be doing and certainly the feedback has been very positive from all of the key players."

But I don't think the same as the natural and I think I don't have them emotional attachment purchases fused by the current offering. So we didn't do this for any other reasons we did in response to the consumer demand out there for what they think the product should be. A very important parts of our color, lots of color and are offering because fashion is color, blue, pink in particular very important risk processes binary, request and laboratory going because it in the lab. And that's very different than the natural business. The response so far anyway has been much better than I thought, particularly in the U.S., which is where we aim this. All the release of the U.S., and we expect all so important that and completely get what we're doing it. We also wanted funders to think twice about finding a reduction given to the margin seemed to us unsustainable in the current offering and there quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that's already happening.

And so in the next 6 months we'll do all the just, we'll do additional drilling, I think what something more sensible to say at the end of the year, we should relate to that. But again I'm also aware of the chatter in Brazil. So look rather noticing something, given where we are. We prefer to wait 6 months and be clear about what we may or may not have, but it's encouraging. Does that help But anyway it's encouraging and suddenly from our point of view the existence in Brazil is something that is certainly a different type of conversation what we've been told of the past.

The 4 kilometers is specific and relates to a batch of pipes and that we know were problematic or potentially problematic and we're in the process of understanding the exact of any mechanism. As you can appreciate, we just want to make sure we got those issues covered. In terms of comfort, it's not an optimistic start. It's what we think is probably the right balance in term in terms of getting the operation by the end of the year. Clearly, their regulatory approvals of which are normal as part of some of this process we expect to be up and navigate to us.

Yes, I've touched upon thing like diesel, some to derive price shipping file server, so using some of those things naturally feel through your cost structure. Apart from that, nothing, I would say terribly remembering that we operate in jurisdictions that have probably higher-than-average and sort of inflation impacts, anyway.

It's complex, you've got the traditional leaders having input, I still think it's got a long way to go. For me, it doesn't worry me. I think them mining charter conversation captures the essence of the nature of the relationship between the 2 parties and that commitment to not jeopardize existing operations and investments, I think, it's absolutely, critical. I think that's a key sentiment we should hold onto. Because in any fair way to go. And the focus on the charter going forward I think other critical element, I think may be then look at harmonizing the 2 and that will take time. So again it's not something I worry. But if you look across the world, the certainty we have in South Africa is a certainly pretty robust, it can be for many jurisdictions some of her colleagues are finding in the industry in the range of places around the world. So we can make South Africa a better way to committed to bring that part of dialogue. 
On M&A, look, we've always kept our eye on the market as we should. But the good news is, and Stephen picked up 3 points, and I want to reiterate those 3 points. Firstly, our growth going forward will come from internal efficiencies. The efficiencies I talked about on the slide is available to us in every part of the business and that's the real focus will be and all the operations guys Bruce and the rest of the and everyone come focused on getting the best of the business and we're still a lot more to be helping the first point. Second point innovation and step changes we invested in investment going in innovation and technology, because we knew that was the best pathway to growth and effective growth in terms of returns on capital. And we are still committed and guys have helped us a lot more opportunity that provides step opportunities in terms of approval. And 3, the internal project pipeline Quellaveco is the, obviously, the large-scale step, but we've got incremental opportunities across the business. So the first thing we need to do is get the best out of the capital assets we have. That's first, second and third priority. At the same time, we can see opportunities that make sense for us, the Mototolo conversion and we see some smaller opportunities that make sense and provide us with the ability to continue to improve our performance across the organization. And again, our focus on expiration provides us with thing the pathway of very value creative growth. So it fits as part of an overall strategy. But we think we're in a better position than most because we got those internal opportunities. If there is something that's out there that make sense, we will follow it up, we can convert it, we demonstrate it we can. But when you got opportunities we got, why would you just of that has a higher level of risk. But not saying we want, but it's going to make sense and it's good to compete with those great opportunities we got inside the portfolio."

One was",341,"To answer the second part of your question on dividends. Maybe just focus on this half result first of all. So I think generally most numbers are pretty spot on in terms of EBITDA. There was a little bit of variance across APS, given the 2 things. One was effective tax rate, it's probably a little bit higher than people were assuming that and that's largely a profit mix thing. So we had a set of higher profits continuing through Australia and South America with slightly higher effective tax rates and a half. So that's why you saw that the effective tax rate a little bit higher than average. The other one is depreciation, people, but just a bit of fun. And that's we have had new assets coming in it and we have had increased volumes come through. So the combination of those 2, I think, whether one few people missing on depreciation. And that flowed through may be a different expectation on the number of earnings -- underlying earnings and therefore on dividend. For a couple of really sensible reasons. We are committed to that 40% payout policy. So in the near term, I think that's what you should put in your spreadsheets and that's what you should expect. Ultimately, we will always work our way around that capital allocation will and as you get towards the sort of the end of that consideration, one of them is additional returns to shareholders. But as a priority, I would say, the balance sheet still outweighs in terms of just making sure. It's absolutely rock solid, as we come into more of an investment size for the company. So I think it's an absolutely right thing to stay focused on. Yes, net debt -- consolidated net debt is one view. I should point out the rest of the world that I would like to get a little bit close and a little bit more aligned right across the balance sheet. That is part of the reason why we remain focused on"

So would you be able to give a guide for where you could get production say over the next 2 years if the market supported it in terms of volumes? And then the question 1b is on thermal coal. In terms of the looking at the group structures you walk through the stress on Costco positioning, it's is me is that interesting thermal coal sort of seems a bit different than lot of your assets, sort of mine life, you're getting towards the end of life at a couple of the assets, more weight of the essay, it's got CSR, coming up in thermal coal these days, I guess, the question is that with the rest of your portfolio, I think improved as much it has.

In diamonds, we are very sensitive to make sure that we're not running ahead of the market. So we're very happy with what we see, and we are supplying to the market and we have a little bit of flex in terms of what we can do. But as we go through the transition and we're making other changes, we don't want to stress that system in the next couple of years. We want to make sure that we're focused on getting our efficiencies right, getting our margins right and not putting more product out there that we might otherwise do better in 2 or 3 years time in getting that balance, right. So Bruce and guys are watching that very carefully. If they had to kick him, I think, we got the capacity to depending upon where we are and what we are doing. Longer term we had closer to the $37 million carats diversity 4- and 5-year period. But again that's based on the transition that we go through and making sure we're getting the best out of the other assets. So we got the potential there, but at the same time, we are trying to match that to the market so that margins in a healthy place. Bruce, do you want to cover that. On thermal coal, did a very good speech a few weeks back to the staff, and if I can borrow on how he present of the story, which I think it's exactly the right way to present it, we got very good assets in thermal coal, very good cost position. We are very low quartile and we can improve with their very significant about 40%, 50% production improvement in the South African the last 3, 3.5 years. We've got 14 years left on average. And from our point of view, it make sense to continue to run those quality assets through that process and we are making sensible capital allocations on incremental life extensions. It would certainly be a lot harder for us to justify a big investment in thermal coal that goes beyond the 7-year lifetime on the basis of, there are questions about the value that you will see in thermal coal relative to oil, gas and the whole fossil fuel question. So we think committing a capital to another incremental projects make sense, but we won't start the business of capital we make sensible decisions. When we talk about the transition, we have the footprint in thermal coal for the last 5 years and we call it just transition. We're connecting with that communities. We're making sure they understand what we're doing in those local communities. The governments and the customers that we work for understand exactly how we're going, and we are making incremental investments. But it will be a lot tougher for us to justify a big investment for our long term and development position in thermal coal, given the uncertainties in the price environment. So it have to be a very special case. So carefully considered, measured as we go and we will give the market and every once in front conversation is very important one to us. And one that we are very cognizant of, but at the same time, we're not going to buy out tomorrow and many of CSR stakeholders are very appreciative of the fact that we haven't run, that we had been clear about the transition, they said, we prefer because we understand the importance of the local communities. We understand the importance of those industries to the big power stations, and it's better to have a responsible operator like you transitioning with those assets than having some other characters -- running those assets in a way that may not be as sensitive as though you guys will run it. So we're trying to get the balance, right."

I think we're going to do a little bit of that diversity go as in the script. Welcome, thanks for joining us this morning. I would like to acknowledge a few of my colleagues this morning before I start. Chairman Chambers. Welcome, Stuart. My colleagues on the management committee sprinkled through the audience. And we've also got Tom McCulley, who is the Project Executive for Quellaveco. He is joining us today. I think he is shopping a plane tonight to Peru. And Ruben Fernandes, Ruben's fresh from Minas-Rio where he has been cleaning the pipeline, so I'm sure he'd be happy to have a chat with couple of you during the course of the morning and a few of my other colleagues. I see Craig Miller is here as well.
So can I encourage all of you to take advantage of having a few people around, you can ask whatever questions you want. And hopefully, we can provide you with the insights you need to help understand where we are, where we've come from and where we're going.
Today, we'll stick pretty well with the format. I'll talk about business performance just briefly, give an overview, talk about where we've come in terms over the last 5 years, some of the work we've done on positions of the business. Stephen will talk about the financial results and unpack the numbers, which I think is very important. So there is a few moving parts here in the set of results that need to be explained. I'll pick up again on the capital allocation. Obviously, the conversation around Quellaveco is an important part of that conversation and really does reflect our focus in a different approach to the way we allocate capital. And then just pick up some details on the foundations that we have created and why we believe we set ourselves up for the next 5 years, it'll look quite different to where we've been. Most importantly though, I think, talking about the lessons we've learned as of last 5 years and how those lessons are being applied into how we think about and how we'll execute the continuing improvement journey that we're focused on over the next 5 years.
And with that, we'll kick straight into performance. From an operating performance point of view, continuing improvement in the operations performance. Our $400 million improvement in the first half reflects that -- half of that $800 million commitment for the full year, again Stephen will unpack those numbers just to help you understand where we've got that from.
Earnings and cash flow reflect continuing improvement in the business. Our EBITDA also up 11%. Attributable free cash flow, when you pull apart the one-offs compared to last year is pretty solid, but we need to continue to improve. 
On margins and returns, we've improved our EBITDA margin to 41%, and our return on capital employed is 19%. So it's a solid set of results, more we can do. And certainly, we're focused on continuing the trends to improve and make sure we've got the business that can deliver consistently.
On safety, health and environment, important place for us to start. Unfortunately, we've reported 2 fatalities in the first half and, in fact, we had a third fatal incident in July. So still a lot of work to be done. We have improved. But from my point of view, these aren't a good set of results until we're at 0. And so that continues the elimination of fatalities task force. Work is starting to get a real momentum. So I think we're in the middle of impacting that performance and, certainly, a 31% improvement in the total frequency rate for the half is encouraging, but nowhere near where we want to be. So encouragement, but a lot more work to be done. 
Health, the numbers are good. We continue to focus on a broad range of issues with work force. 
On the environmental side, again a solid set of results, but I would say, the disappointment, obviously, Minas-Rio, of the 4 incidents, that we reported in the first half, the Minas-Rio relates with 2 of those incidents. Lot of work going on now. As we stand today, we are in the middle of the process of inspecting the pipe. We are setting up to replace around 4 kilometers of pipe. So that's been ordered. It's all being done. The preparation work is being done. We're working with the authorities to make sure that we've got appropriate independent advice and that we're connecting to the authorities so that the appropriate regulatory approvals move through fairly quickly. So we're still on track to start producing again by the end of the year, but there is a fair bit of work to be done and to make sure that we fully understand the mechanism. We believe we do, but I want to wait till all the inspections are done to make sure we've got every angle covered. So a lot of work going on, and, again, both Chambers and Ruben are here, if you'd like to understand a little bit more after our sessions. You're more than welcome to check with the guys.
On productivity and improvement, generally, through the operations, as you know, productivity continues to improve. For us, volumes are up 8% over the last 5 years, and the key number, obviously, number of assets. So when we talk fairly drastic action in either closing or selling assets, we pulled out about 15% to 17% of our productive capacity. So the fact that we are up 8% reflects improved performance from the existing assets. And on average, it's about 30% uplift in performance across the existing asset or the current asset suite. We've also had a couple of contributions from assets coming into the mix, Grosvenor, for example, but they're still not yet at full capacity. So our productivity should continue to improve over the course of the next 18 months. And for us, that's very important because we want to continue to improve our operating cost in our competitive positions.
On numbers, in terms of people, there has been a significant reduction. We've gone from around 160,000 down to 95,000. We will continue to tighten the cost structure up within the business, so those numbers will continue to reduce, but we're making sure that we do that with all of our employees, but that's where the focus is to continue to improve our cost position.
I just wanted to give a little bit of sense or to give you a little sense of what does an average 30% improvement look like across the business. So this slide is a slide around Mogalakwena. It could easily be Sishen. It could be Moranbah. It could be Grasstree. It could be Kolomela. It could be Los Bronces, we get to picture. 
So at Mogalakwena, on mining, our shovel productivities have gone from 1,700 to 2,300. There is still a long way to improve. The last 5 years, we're up 5% -- 34%, sorry, and we still see significant performance potential in the assets, but that's been encouraging in terms of the underlying mixed shovel productivities across the group.
On truck utilization, we're up 20%, almost 20%. So actually at 20%. Now we've gone from 5,400 hours per truck to 6,500 hours per truck. So it also helps explain why our sustaining capital numbers have been improving as well. So we're getting more out of the assets we have. 
In terms of the concentrators and tonnes processed, we're up 35% and so -- whilst we've improved the north concentrator and the south concentrator. We did add some incremental volumes with BAOBAB, but overall the underlying efficiency improvements in our operations is north of 20%. Again that's very important and not $1 of capital is being spent on any of those improvements.
At the same time, we've gone from 74% recovery of payable material to 80% recovery. So the volumes are up. And without putting new storage or other capacity in, we've been able to improve our underlying recoveries by 8%. So that's straight to the bottom line. So that's been significant. So we're improving, but the volumes and the quality of the work that's being done, as a consequence of that improvement and with the way we set the pit up, and if you can recall 3, 4 years ago, we talked about rescheduling the pit over the next 15 years, we've got some improvements in grade. And when you add all that up together, we've seen a 60% increase in production of precious metals.
So we're now at or around 1 million ounces of precious metals. We talk about platinum, but for us, it's about all the payables and that's north of 1 million ounces payable. Today, our margin is 45%, even though the platinum prices dropped 30%, that's been significant. And the real story, and this all adds up to -- and this is equivalent platinum cost, we've gone from $994 back in 2012 to $250 an ounce. So Chris' target of 0 platinum cost is alive and well. There is still a lot of potential, and we think we can get there. Obviously, grade will play some part in that. But from our point of view, 75% reduction, or if you want to talk margins, we've gone from a 40% margin to a 45% margin, despite a 30% reduction in the price of products we produce. And that's really a big part of the story in terms of getting platinum from net $1.5 billion debt to a net cash position at the half year in a pretty strong place, and so very pleased with that. And again that's a number of assets that I could talk to in those same terms, Sishen, Kolomela, a full portfolio.
Importantly, it's improving our competitive position across our commodities. So in 2013, the best data we had for the business is 2014. But if you look at the positions across the quartile cost curves, these are the positions by commodity that we occupied back in 2013, '14. So as a consequence of portfolio, operating efficiencies and sort of the new innovation stuff that we're starting to think with and introducing to the operation, which became a much bigger part of the story in the next 5 years. We started to see improvements in a relative position. So this means we're moving quicker in those areas, where you see we're going to the right in terms of cost positions relative to competitors. So copper has gone from 71% to the 57 percentile. Quellaveco built in Q1 will take us mid-Q2. So again, a very important addition to the portfolio in terms of the quality of the copper business.
Met coal, Moranbah, in particular, Grosvenor will still -- will start to make a significant contribution, and Grass Tree has taken us to the top of the league table in terms of longwall operations moving us again to the left. So Tyler Mitch has done a great job in the Met Coal business. In De Beers, general focus on cost, Gahcho Kué is making a good contribution. So again moving to the left with more to be done. 
In platinum, you know the Mogalakwena story that we are improving other assets, including Amandelbult, a lot more to be done in those assets and a lot more potential still at Mogalakwena, but a good shift to the left. In nickel, Barro Alto got the furnaces sorted out. From what we can judge in the Nickel business, Barro Alto now is the -- one of the very few major new nickel assets that are actually hit the design capacity. And if you remember the problems we had with the furnaces, we redid the furnaces and now are at full rate and again, Ruben has been the leader of the business for some years now and is probably the best in control asset that we've got across the group. And we've got a lots of success stories, but in terms of nickel, those furnaces are really starting to set the trend and the benchmark for us as a business to follow in terms of running an asset well.
In thermal coal, story not as positive. We pulled up capital in Cerrejón with their partners on the basis that we didn't think it was the right time or we weren't spending that capital as well as we could. So we pulled a bit to the right. We've also got 2 assets, getting close to end of life. So that's impacted the costs. Over the next 3 to 4 years, rate will start to come out of the system. So we'll move again to the left, but there is more work to be done on productivity and Seamus can talk about some of the things he is working on at the moment in thermal coal, in particular, in South Africa.
In iron ore, you guys know the story pretty well, a lot of new capacity in the Pilbara and in Brazil has been built. So the curves shunted to the right. In our case, we more than halved our controllable cost at Kumba. But even with that, we've not been able to complete at this level, but we've closed the gap to the Pilbara and Brazil. And in fact, I think 3 of the months last year towards the end of the year, where premium -- quality premiums and not premiums were pretty good. We're actually middle Q2. So for us, the target is $10 a tonne either through premiums and cost, that would give us a 35 breakeven landed in China, gets us in this run. So Seamus and the guys and Themba know what has to be done in the next 3 to 5 years, that's we're in pursuit of trying to get ourselves on the bottom half of the cost curve.
Minas-Rio at full rate is mid-Q2 as well by strong quality and cost around 35 landed in China. So there is work to be done. We know what we've got to do, but there is still more to be done to get ourselves to the left-hand side of the cost curve. So today 2018, we've moved from 52 percentile to 46 percentile. We have a view on how we've done against our competitors. We've done well, we think, but it's a constant analysis from our point of view because we've got to keep driving ourselves to the left. So in each of those businesses, we know what we've got to do to get ourselves to the left. We got to try and get there quicker than our competitors, and that's the imperative, that's the focus and that's what I'll talk about when I talk about things a little bit later in terms of the 5 years. So today, if you remember, we are predominantly here. We've moved a lot of the businesses into the second quartile, but we still got more work to do. And certainly, we know how to get there in copper, and Seamus and the guys are very focused on getting us there in iron ore as well.
As a consequence, from 2012, we're up to 41% margin. That is against a lower price deck for our commodities. So a 23% reduction in cost, which is the nominal number or about 30% real has helped us move up the margin curve. And we know and -- that includes, sorry, I should say, also includes the marketing work that Peter and the team have been doing, so that's been important in terms of our margins. 
Over the next 5 years -- 3 to 5 years, we'll continue with the efficiency work. Our innovation and technology work is set to make a more significant contribution in the 3- to 5-year range.  And again, Tony can describe some of the things we've got going. And with -- obviously, with Quellaveco and the smaller projects that we're starting to put under the launching pad, there is a real push to head us towards the 50% type margin. Clearly, subject to price. But on an apples-to-apples basis, we know where we've got to go and what we're driving towards.
So with that, I'll hand across to Steve. He will unpack the number."

So it's a really good set of numbers. It's a clean set of numbers. Importantly, it sort of simply shows where we're focusing and our efforts as we run the business and as we prioritize the things that we want to do internally. And those priorities really continue around the balanced approach. So it's a balanced approach around returns to shareholders, capital allocation and ongoing focus on the balance sheet. And the same themes that you saw in the last 6 months prior, you're seeing in these 6 months and you'll see again in the next 6 months, the journey continues. We'll also unpack a little bit about the EBITDA drivers and will finish on the report card that we talked to.
So we speak a lot about our focus on cost and volume. And the reason we do that is because we know from time to time at different parts of the cycle, we will come under pressure from inflation and other sort of cost increases. This half, we delivered $400 million of the $800 million target that we set for this year, and that $400 million takes us to $4.6 billion since 2012.
What are we seeing in terms of some of those cost increases, and we touched on the same a little bit at the full year results, so increased diesel price given the higher oil price, but that's the same for everyone really across the industry. We're seeing increased energy prices, particularly Schiedam in South Africa, and that can reflect itself either in electricity prices or in infrastructure charges if those things also use energy. And we've also seen a little bit of wages and salary growth again South Africa, South America, in particular. But that's the reason why we stay focused on these cost and volume improvements, so we stay ahead of the curve. So let's have a quick talk at this Slide. So we'll move across left to right. So in terms of prices, KGMs up, largely driven by palladium and rhodium.
Copper, thermal coal also up. In terms of currency, a little bit of a mixed bag. In terms of currency, it's probably the most noticeable one, was the strengthening of the ZAR through the half, so the South African Rand through the half, and that softened right towards the end of June 30. 
Inflation, I've touched on. Minas-Rio, we'll highlight separately for you through the year, so that you can just clearly understand the impact that has first and second half. The good news is, we are on track in terms of the inspection and repair work. Garden's unchanged in terms of coming on at the end of the fourth quarter. And really, as we look forward to '19, a little bit of positive momentum into earnings as that comes back on stream.
I just want to step away for a moment from this half's numbers and just look a little bit forward as we look at that sort of cost and volume improvement journey that's ahead of us. So you recall, at the full year, we outlined our target over the next 5 years from the start of '18 to the end of '22, $3 billion to $4 billion improvement that we're looking for. And there is really 3 broad buckets. So I just want to give you a touch of a little more detail to help you understand where the focus is.
So the first bucket is operational efficiency. You'll hear us talk internally and probably a little more externally about pay one-on-one, and this is sort of the catchphrase that we have internally that really talks about getting to benchmark and beyond. So full potential plus is sort of another phrase of how we explain it. And even though we've had a great journey in some of the assets, and Mark spoke about Mogalakwena before, there is still a real opportunity in front of us. And we've improved Mogalakwena. We've improved Sishen. We've improved cutting rights and things from Moranbah-Grosvenor, but we still have real opportunity in front of us to get to benchmark and beyond and really sort of set the trend for the industry. And that's across all the diggers, all the tracks, processing plant, recovery, it's everywhere. We've got that same mentality as we look for those improvement opportunities.
When you do start to approach pay one-o-one, you've got to start to make some choices. How do you take that benefit? Do you take that benefit in terms of cost out? Do you pack up trucks? Do you pack up deals? Do you take that benefit in terms of the increased production, if you can get it to market down infrastructure? Or is it some combination of both? Is it a focus on grade and quality of products, so the maximizing your margin of what you earn for each time? So the other sort of choices that we have to make as we go forward, great choices and great opportunities to have to think through. It's a really, really great challenge as we look and think about the business all the way from mine to market and think about how we maximize that value equation.
Second bucket is around technology and innovation. And here I suppose I want to give you a sense that we're moving out of the lab and into the field, right? So we really have a quite a neat schedule as we roll out some of these production to test units across some of our operations. Some in the concentrated mine. It's about box sorting. What is that? It's about more precisely getting the cut-off grade right by separating prior to the main processing plant. The lower grade element of what we're about to put through the plan. So the aim there is a 10% to 20% increase in food grade through the processing plant. We're about to put the first of those units into El Soldado, should be in about end of August, September timing. I think that's Jwaneng. And then early next year, Barro Alto and Mogalakwena. And also those things really starting to go live and roll out across the operations.
In copper, we're probably more certain of the benefit. Platinum still doing some early phase work to make sure that we're going to get those sorts of benefits. On coarse particle flotation, so I remember that's sort of coarser grinding, so that we get -- we use less energy, so the target there is 30% more throughput, a smaller recovery loss, maybe 3%, and that should get us 20% less energy, 30% less water. Again, copper will be the first rollout of that at El Soldado and that will really be through the early half of 2019.
The third bucket's really about project delivery, and Mark touched on some of those things we've spoken a bit then before Moranbah-Grosvenor and debottlenecking potentially an extra vessel in Debmarine, Quellaveco coming in at the end of '22. So lots of opportunities in front of us. Again, the commitment across the whole organization to chase these things, really quite exciting for us at the moment, the momentum and enthusiasm that we have got across all of the operations.
Okay, so back to some of today's results. My message here is really about stability of the earnings and effectiveness of capital allocation. So from a stability of earnings point of view, 3% increase in EPS, 6% increase in return-on-capital employed to 19%.
Looking at cash flow. So we did have a really strong 2017. So we did have a number of sort of one-offs benefits that flow through 2017, which you are now seeing a more normalized level sort of cash flow on a half-to-half basis. So last time around some of the one-offs, we had slightly lower cash tax. We just restarted the dividend post the half year. So we had less minority leakage. We had lower CapEx. We had a bit of working capital release in the first half of last year. So a more normalized state this time around. If you normalize for those things, it could increase period-on-period strong cash flow for the half.
Turning to the balance sheet. Focus on net debt reductions continued, a further $0.5 billion down to $4 billion. It remains a priority for us, as I said earlier, and we are determined still to take advantage of this window of opportunity that we have before we have to put our hand in our pocket to -- for CapEx on Quellaveco.
At $4 billion, we're probably really at the low end of -- we're very, very comfortable with where the debts hits for this part of the cycle. So remember, I spoke last time around a bit the way I look at the balance sheet across 3 key metrics. So absolute net debt level, obviously, strength of the balance sheet. Net debt-to-EBITDA strength of the underlying cash flow, although that can obviously move with volatility and commodity prices and, obviously, net gearing or net leverage ratios really goes to the heart of the strength of the balance sheet even through those cycles. We will remain focused on all 3. Our guidance for the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at 1 to 1.5x. We don't want to exceed that for any long period and through the lows of the cycle. Obviously, we're at incredibly attractive levels as we should be for this part of the cycle. Ideally, we want to set this balance sheet up, so that we can become cyclical if opportunities emerge in the years ahead.
So in terms of returns to shareholders, we're committed to the payout policy, 40% of underlying earnings per share, $0.49 for the period, slightly nonstop from where we were in the prior half. So with this dividend that takes our returns to shareholders to $1.9 billion since we restarted the dividend this time last year. That's about 4% yield. Just to tick over, I think, on today's process. So just to wrap it up, then how did we go in terms of report card? So prior to discretionary capital, $1.8 billion of cash flow. What did we do with it? Net debt down $0.5 billion, final dividend $700 billion in terms of -- $700 million in terms of returns to shareholders and a few other bits and pieces. Discretionary capital $200 million for the half. Obviously, that will tick up a little bit through the second half of 2019. So as I say, continued journey, continued trends, a good journey that we're on. Mark, back to you."

People asked me about the ship in terms of capital discipline. When I look at Bruce, if I could just make a simple point, one of those incremental improvements that we've got available to us is to build and put on the water a new ship, represents when you payback, that's what we're about. Efficiency of capital, getting good returns. And that typifies or exemplifies our perfect project [indiscernible].
For us, when we look at the business, we talk about the commodity positions, I'd like to stress the point that the positions we have by commodity are function of our focus on quality assets. It's our focus on quality assets that determines where we put our capital and where we develop. The good news for us in copper, the fundamentals are strong. We've got a great position, and we're able to convert that opportunity and something very real with Quellaveco and many pursuing copper in the industry, we've got some great internal options both from a greenfield's perspective, a brownfield's perspective. And longer term, we think our exploration work will position us even further in terms of the industry. So great position to be in.
In terms of -- I'm sorry, I should go back -- just finish the story. In terms of diamonds, we continue to supply to demand. And as we see demand growing, we've got the ability to flex. We are transitioning in a couple parts of the business. Obviously, Venetia going from open cut to underground. So that's a transition story at the moment. Gahcho Kué hitting and strapped, certainly, continuing improvements. Obviously, Debmarine and Jwaneng, important contributors in terms of the business. And certainly, the prognosis looks pretty good going forward, suddenly very encouraging. 
On PGM, big focus on Mogalakwena and its ability to make continuing improvements and a major or significantly improved contribution. But in particular, for us right at the moment, a lot more work to be done at Amandelbult. And so still continuing our journey down the cost curve. A lot   of work to be done. Very focused. Chris and his team are very focused there. And clearly, the big contribution for bulks. If you look at the numbers from bulks for the last couple of years, they've been exceptional. Moranbah, the Grosvenor ramp-up continues. So from that point of view, lots of incremental opportunities in that business to improve that contribution and, certainly, the contribution in the last 2 years has been significant and will continue to be strong, given the improving performance across the business.
For us, the potential or the focus on portfolio upgrading has continued. Obviously, we'll talk about Quellaveco in a couple of minutes. PGMs, union mine, we've completed the sale. BRPM sale continues their focus on really focusing on those assets that can move the dollar for us. The Mototolo acquisition should be really sort of that -- firstly, we know the asset, we know the resource, the purchase position with Glencore is about extending from the 5-year life to a 30-year life, with a connection to Der Brochen. That doesn't mean we're going to go and do anything significant today. What it does do is provide us a long-term option in terms of the business. It's not the right time in the market to go and spend something new in terms of the asset, but positioning ourselves very important in terms of quality assets for the long term, and we see this as a good move. 
Thermal coal, you're aware of the completion of the transactions on the tide mines along with New Largo. And in De Beers, we haven't been standing with our feet in the mud. Lightbox, a very important step in terms of the business and, again, Bruce is here, if you'd like a bit more insight into that, happy to answer any questions. And obviously, the offer for Peregrine flags and approach for us that's very important, the world is short of diamonds. There will be significant shortfall by 2022. So we're positioning ourselves with options in terms of going into the market. But again, it's market-led, making sure that we're doing the right things and spending our money in a smart way.
Quellaveco, some have observed that the photo does indicate that we have been active in the last 2 or 3 years. The actual number, Jason, is about $500 million in terms of investment in value in the ground, in keeping the option open, but I think it's been money well invested in terms of understanding the geotechnical issues, understanding the big issues that you don't know about before you make those big commitments and most importantly, it's been an investment in the community and the commitments that we made to the community. So in terms of those relationships, absolutely critical in a place like Peru, and we certainly got the support of the local committee. So it's been an important part of the work.
On Quellaveco itself, obviously, returns, key focus for us, making sure that we get the discipline right. Internal rate of return works off the midpoint of the range we talked about in terms of the capital, the $5 billion to $5.3 billion. Return on capital employed is north of 20% when we hit that full production rate and through the first 10 years, and our payback post first production is 4 years, so for us very important metrics. And if you look at the key hurdles that we set ourselves in terms of our capital allocation processes 4 years ago, it takes each one of those boxes.
In terms of the asset itself, low cost. And I'll unpack why the costs are as low as they are. Long life, obviously, the resource is significant. We do see significant long-term potential beyond the 30 years. And I think the address in terms of who is next to us tells you there is a good story or good potential story there in the long term. 
Capital discipline, the commitment to the syndication and the partnership with Mitsubishi was very important. And as Stephen indicated, we won't be required to put our hand in our pocket in finding our share and to -- well into 2019. So that's an important point to make in terms of the balance sheet and our continued journey in reducing our debt.
In terms of being execution-ready, it's permitted. The social credentials is where we had been investing, working very hard with the local community, very strong. And from the dialogue table in 2012, it's been a real success story in terms of the conversations. Interestingly, the Governor, the Chair, the round table in 2012 is now the President of the country. And so I think he is probably more excited than we are in terms of the commitment, and we'll be standing with him next week, talking about that in the context of Peru. So a very strong support from the government right the way through the local community, which is something that's very important in all of that jurisdiction and particularly Peru.
Again execution-ready in terms of the community support. We've actually committed through the life of the project, $300 million in community investment programs and it's not the investment programs that we think they should have via the investment programs that they've asked us to help them with in being a true partner in the community. And it is different -- it's a different approach, it's a different conversation, and we think critical to ensure continuity and cost competitiveness of the project you need your local community in there as a partner.
Our key permits are in place. The construction program is as good as I have seen in my 42 years in the industry. Clearly, we've had a long time to bake this cake and we've done a lot of the pre-work and we've applied all the lessons that we could, plus some, out of our of our previous adventures or misadventures in some cases. So I think it's well set up and we're well set up for success. Tom's here to lead the project, but Duncan, Tony, all of the GMC members have been active participants in making sure that we looked at this from every angle.
The syndication, I think, was an important message to everyone that we are serious about thinking about a different investment model for the industry. Yes, it borrows somewhat from the oil and gas sector in terms of sharing that risk. We've got a good partnership with Mitsubishi. We know them well, they know us well, and certainly from our point of view, we think it's a win-win for both of us as an organization. And when I talk about returns the fact that we've been able to book a profit on some of the investments we have made is actually helped us return a little bit better IRR return than we're reporting at the project level. So the good news is it actually enhances our returns as well, and we think that's smart to do, in putting a little bit of that profit back in our pocket and using that to help fund the early parts of the progress and keep our balance sheet in good shape and able to support the continuing improvements across other parts of the portfolio. So again we think it's a win-win for us and for all parts of our business.
The returns, very important. You've seen the headline numbers I've talked about. I think the EBITDA margin -- we talked about that 50% target for us as a group. This helps us achieve that type of improvement in our margins. The construction capital, and this is our share post-syndication in the range $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. I think it's important to focus on as well as in terms of Anglo American's financial commitment to building the project. And from our point of view, in 2018, our share will be around $400 million, so it will be fully funded from the proceeds that we received from Mitsubishi and that goes well into '19 as well.
Unit operating cost for the first 10 years, $1.05. In fact with the softer material in the first 5 years, it's a bit below that. The structural cost advantages are important for people to understand. Its low-strip ratio below one. Secondly, for the first 10 years most of the haul is downhill. So you've got low-cost haulage costs and the labor cost and the energy cost are very competitive. They are not a pittance as some would be in other parts of the world. In Peru, it's a developed country. It's a progressive country, productivity is good, the pays are good, but more competitive than some of the other jurisdictions. So from our point of view the structural cost base is very good. Hydropower is also an advantage in terms of the energy. So it's a good mix and we're making a good contribution in terms of the organization. And it's also sustainable because the pay rates are very competitive on a broader basis. Production 300,000 tonne a year for the first 10 years, a little bit higher than that the first 5, again as a consequence of the softer material going through the plant very quickly. 
Cost position, as we said, we will improve our cost position as a consequence of Quellaveco. It will move us solidly into Q2. If you remember the copper position on the [ cop ] curve. So that's an important step for us, again a continuing focus on improving the portfolio.
Can you give us a click on the slide? Thank you. The start of the resource unit, I think the big thing with the copper deposits, we're in a great address. So the 2 southern copper assets that flank us have been long-term assets, very successful assets. And certainly from our point of view, the address is a great address. Mineralization is pretty well known. And from our point of view, it's open to depth, certainly in one direction. So we would expect beyond the 40 years from the project. And if you look at the resource space, obviously, significant. We would like to think it's beyond 60 years, a lot of work to be done, obviously, to prove those sorts of numbers, but significant potential. If you look at history in terms of Los Bronces growth since 2004, same with Collahuasi, we think it's one of those types of deposits that becomes a long-term foundation for the group. And so a very important commitment and I think well priced, great returns and for the long-term is a changing or is a portfolio changer for us as a group.
So on the foundations that we've set or have been setting and with Quellaveco being another step towards building on those foundations, I think it's important to just reflect for a moment that today if you look at where we were 5 years ago, our average life of mine was somewhere between 20 and 25 years. Today, we are at 30 years across the portfolio. Our thermal coal assets have got the shortest life of about 14 years and some assets have got beyond 100, [ Aquila ] and Mogalakwena. Our target is in the next 5 years is to make sure we maintain that life as a minimum. And there are opportunities to increase the life, which will then ultimately underpin future growth in the asset base, again connected to the markets. But with that type of asset base, we're in a unique position and certainly, unique in our industry and it gives us the ability to focus on that the underlying improvement for the long term. So every time we make an improvement, we got 30 years to bag the results, and that's critical and that is different in our industry to many of our competitors. 
So we've also got a list of opportunities in each of those commodity positions that provide us with the opportunity to grow, and we are forecasting as Stephen talked about, a 3% growth year-on-year through to 2022. And we have the options that go well beyond that type of configuration or that time frame. So Sakatti for example, something that could follow Quellaveco, market conditions permitting. But it's a smaller asset, low capital base, high margins, great returns. So we've got a number of those types of opportunities across the portfolio. 
Something that we'll start to talk about in the next year or 2 is exploration. Through the tough times in '15 and '16, we didn't stop committing to exploration and technical innovation. And I think today, we're starting to see the benefits of that commitment in terms of what we're doing on the ground. So in terms of our exploration strategy, Tony and the team redefined our approach to exploration, a step [ back ], big regional positions, think about exploration in a very different way. And so we are focused on key geographies. The innovation work that we're doing now is being applied to our approach to exploration. And for us, it's all about value. And certainly from our point of view, we think the exploration team is starting to show real value for the commitment that we've shown in the last 2 or 3 years, in particular. And today, we've got some really interesting positions. For those that have been tracking as you're probably aware that we drilled some holes in Brazil, 6 holes. We stopped. We've actually pegged out fairly substantial land position. I think it's 5x the size of Kent, where in Australia, it's about the size of [ Gena's ] backyard. 
It is a significant position. And certainly, from our point of view, it's a very interesting place to be. We think we may be sitting on a [ indiscernible ], but there is a lot of work still to be done, early days, but we'll keep you posted in terms of the process over next 6 to 18 months. And our brownfields opportunity, we've been doing a lot of drilling around Mogalakwena, Los Bronces both from an underground potential and extension to the existing operation and obviously the [ indiscernible ] district. So we're not going to do much more than let you know that this is becoming very important part of our portfolio and the future options that we have. 
Again, focus on asset quality as a consequence, revenue by product, quite a mixed bag. So that from our point of view, it really is different, and we are providing different set of options to the marketplace. And in our case, the quality of the assets that underpin those revenue streams are very strong. So from our perspective, we could get differentiated, it's unique. Capital employed by geography overtime has been balancing pretty well, South Africa at 26%, used to be up near 50%. We are getting that balance right, certainly from our point of view, we think the risk profile in terms of the revenue base is starting to balance out quite nicely, and that will continue to balance out over the next 3 to 5 years with the commitment to Quellaveco, certainly improving that balance across key geographies. 
I just turned the thing off, that wasn't helpful. In terms of how we are positioned in commodities for the future. We are well positioned in electrification and innovation. A greener world, PGMs, in particular, copper is part of that world. In terms of coking coal, the quality of our coking coal and the quality of our iron ore is playing very much into the China environmental story. We think the premiums on those products will certainly remain as China and other locations focus on quality and making sure that it's both efficiency and clean production from those sources. We think that's important and growing middle-class, platinum jewelry, diamonds, those other products, are all playing into those sectors. So again there is a consequence of our differentiation across the portfolio, we're playing into the right market segments in terms of use of raw materials and products. 
And finally, for us, again, it's about assets. We're building the capabilities inside the organization to take advantage of the quality we have inside the asset base. And for us, it's about cash flow, it's about the efficiency of those cash flows as measured in return on capital and it's about being sustainable from safety all the way through to the social contract we have with the partners in developing new opportunities in the business, absolutely critical. And that's the Anglo American story. So I'm very happy to take questions."

Yes. I mean just a way into the cost story. So it was a great half for copper. Currency and a bit of inflation went against us, but going with us was obviously both the volume increase, grade as you said, and them some byproduct credits also sort of played into that. So a good outcome and Duncan has assured me he is going to keep delivering for the second half so that, again, I would expect this to come inside our previous guidance. Generally, across the other commodities, I suppose the same part of that last theme. So mixed impacts in terms of currency and volumes, grade, et cetera, but generally we are inside and tracking inside of our full year guidance for most of the commodities. Coming to your other topics. So [ Quellaveco ] CapEx. So we are guiding that we will spend $400 million on a 100% basis for the balance of this -- $300 million to $400 million for the balance of this calendar year. That will be funded from the proceeds, from the sell down. Some of those proceeds will then carry on through into next year. And so on the first phase, largely through the first half, will also be funded from those proceeds, and it's really then -- let's call it mid-next year that will start to contribute on a 60-40 basis. So if you recall in the announcement of the sell down, it's about $833 million comes in and that's the $500 plus gross up comes into the account. So it's the 834th millionth dollar that then gets funded on the 60-40 basis, if that's the correct [ THs ] and all those sorts of things. We're not guiding at the moment in terms of the exact spilt. When we come out with capital guidance for '19, we will give you better split and those sort of things, but it's a fairly typical sort of project spend profile. So years sort of '19 -- years '20, '21 will probably be the largest spends and then it will ease back in '22 as we get to the end. In terms of dividend policy, we're really happy with the 40% sort of guidance and payout ratio. When we struck it, and we still think it strikes the right balance. Now remember for us, it's not about one thing or the other, so it's not about capital returns to shareholders and that's all we got to do with the money. We think we struck a really nice balance in terms of appropriate returns to shareholders, sensible capital allocation and investment in the future, whether that be longer-term or shorter-term type initiatives and [ indiscernible ] the balance sheet. So we still -- our priority each of those 3, absolutely unashamedly. I'd love to make progress across the balance sheet still for the next 12 months. So we think we got that balance right. Ultimately, we will work our way around that capital allocation wheel. And if we find ourselves with excess cash as we worked around that wheel, then we will consider how we allocate it back. Right now, I think, the 40% really strikes the right balance."

But a Watford forward could. Okay, firstly on the pipeline, we understand -- we believe we understand the key issue with respect to the technical issue: deterioration of a weld. We have tracked a poor batch of pipes. And we know exactly where every one of those pipe is. So the 4 kilometers is based on our understanding and knowledge of what we've seen so far. The most important thing, Menno, is to make sure we confirm that, that is in fact the issue and the only issue. There is a deep technical analysis that the guys took me through over the full 12 hours, and so I'm happy I think we covered every angle. And as part of the resolution, monitoring the pipe for changed ambient condition is very important because these things don't fail catastrophically. There may be a fatigue, a small leak over a period of time and it gathers pace. The key thing will be to monitor by temperature, by moisture, by sound and by vibration and we'll have an early indication. We're making sure that those technologies are part of the fix. So that's why it's taking a bit longer, making sure we understand it and that the fix covers not only the integrity of the pipeline, but also providing early warnings if we have any issues so that we are in full control of the pipeline and making sure it works. Now, the Samarco pipeline ran 6 years without a leak. So we're also understanding those technologies. We got a few of the Samarco team actually working with us. So we got experience with us working through those potential [ solutions ] as well. So again the right technical expertise right across-the-board is been applied and we're using the advisers to the prosecutor and the government. And I think again the prosecutors appreciate the fact that we got that type of expertise on the job. Yes, they have in some ways appointed themselves as the protectorate for the community. But having said that, we are in a very constructive dialogue with the guys. And so from our point of view, they will continue to do that job, our job is to give them comfort that we've got the issues covered. I think we're well down that pathway. It's not there and yet. There is still couple of operating processes we have to go through, and I think the guys are doing everything they should be doing and certainly the feedback has been very positive from all of the key players."

First on the engagement, I'm very comfortable that all of our producer governments are very comfortable with Lightbox. I personally spoke to President [ Khama ] before he left President [ Masisi ], President Ramaphosa and President Geingob, and each of their cabinets. I can see that the cabinet in South Africa and they are all enthusiastic supporters. So a lot of engagement, but I think very good alignment for now producer countries. I think we should remember we launched Lightbox in relation to consumer research, which came back to us, which is consumers in America say they do see that there is a place for fun fashion accessible product in laboratory grown diamonds. But I don't think though the same as the natural and I think they don't have any emotional attachment purchases and they were confused by the current offering. So we didn't do this -- if for any other reason, we did it in response to the consumer demand out there for what they think the product should be. A very important parts of it are color, lots of color in our offering because fashion is color, blue and pink in particular and very important is that the pricing is all binary, so 1 carat costs twice what 0.5 carat costs, and laboratory grown because it takes you twice as long to grow it in the lab. And that's very different than the natural business. The response so far anyway has been much better than I thought, particularly in the U.S., which is where we aim this. So all the retailers in the U.S., and we speak to all of them, understand why we're doing it and support it, and completely get why we're doing it. We also wanted funders to think twice about funding more production given that the margin seemed to us unsustainable in the current offering and there quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that's already happening. We've probably didn't engage as much as we might have in places like India and Antwerp, but that's not where the current problem is. So we spent much of our engagement in America. I'm very comfortable with where we are there and we'll keep engaging around the world as we always do."

So our ability to talk to what we've got -- we're just constrained by those requirements and they're appropriate. There is obviously lots of chatter in Brazil. People know that we put a hole through something. We are making sure we understand what that is, but there is a lot of work to be done and we've both been around long enough, 40-odd years. He has been around a bit longer than me. You gotta be careful with this stuff because it may not be what we hope it is. And so in the next 6 months we'll do all the anomaly tests. We'll do additional drilling, I think we'll have something more sensible to say at the end of the year. We should [ rise ] to that. But again I'm also aware of the chatter in Brazil. So it would look rather odd not to say something, given where we are. We prefer to wait 6 months and be clear about what we may or may not have, but it's encouraging. Does that help? But anyway it's encouraging and certainly from our point of view the existence of [ indiscernible ] in Brazil is something that is certainly a different type of conversation than what we've been told in the past.

Firstly on the comfort point, the technical work and we are very open to share the technical reports when the work is done. We are very transparent. We'll think that's appropriate. We'll do that with the authorities and we'll do that with anyone that has an interest. From our point of view, we think the evidence is pretty strong, but we want to make sure that we haven't missed anything. So we're working through that process. The 4 kilometers is specific and relates to a batch of pipes that we know were problematic or potentially problematic and we're in the process of understanding the exact failure mechanism. As you can appreciate, we just want to make sure we got those issues covered. In terms of comfort, it's not an optimistic start. It's what we think is probably the right balance in term in terms of getting the operation up by the end of the year. Clearly, the regulatory approvals, which are normal as part of this kind of process, we expect to be able to navigate those. If there are any other issues that pop up, might take a little bit longer, but at this stage based on all the stuff we have done so far, we're pretty sure we know what the issue is. But again we want to make sure we have got every angle reasonably covered. So we're being prudent, I think, in what we are saying but at the same time, realistic in that there are still a few things to navigate as part of the process. 
In terms of going forward, again, we're a transparent company. We believe in sharing those things that people should be aware of, and we'll do that in an appropriate way. But certainly, the feedback and the support we had in the community, the fact that we have been there from the first minute, explained every step to the community, the prosecutor and all the key players, they appreciate how open we are and they have been surprised I think how open we are. In fact, I know a couple of competitors are now using Ruben's work on the crisis management as an example of how something should be handled So it's great credit to the Ruben and the team in terms of how they handled a difficult situation at the time. And I think that's helping us in terms of our dialogues with the communities. Seamus do you want to add some?"

I think the pipeline inspection gauge technology that does 3 different sets of gauges being run down cumulatively they allow us to take cracks down to 1 millimeter.

We won't -- so the restart is based on replacing 4 kilometers, and to go back to Menno's question, how do we know that 4 kilometers have to be replaced? We don't. We've risk assessed the pipeline, look at all contributed factors to the leaks and based on that assessment we believe if there are any issues those issues will be in the 4 kilometers immediately after the second pump station. So it's anticipatory replacement, but we obviously won't restart until we have all the results back from the pipeline inspection gauge runs. We've analyzed those. We've assessed the condition of the pipeline, but we're anticipating that we won't have to replace pipes, except in the 4 kilometers."

And certainly from our point of view, the refusals are very low. That's usually very good indicator. Secondly, from a Botswana perspective, we never stopped talking to the Botswana government about what we're doing, how we are working together. I think it would be fair to say that we've come on a journey together, and it is a very positive relationship. They've been very supportive of everything we've done. And as you would expect, Bruce and the team are in the appropriate conversation to make sure we get it framed right. But for us, long-term commitments on stripping they understand that we are there for the long haul. So we'll find the right outcomes. It's getting tighter for us obviously and them in terms of value. So it's really about consolidating the relationship and making sure that we're both 110% committed, and I think we are going the right way in those conversations. And Bruce do you want to add anything to that? That's fine.
And third on [ Vulcan ], firstly, Mr. Argawal has been a very supportive shareholder. He's made it very clear from everything that we have said or seen in the press and in his conversation to us that he likes our strategy. He's supportive of what we have been doing as a management team. He has said also that he prefers not to sell any further assets. We haven't been in that process were 2 years. So I think that's a positive. Beyond that you need to ask him, but we're certainly not in any other conversations. The conversations we have with the team with Mr. Argawal is consistent with the conversation we have with all of our shareholders. And so there is nothing else at play or any other conversations in place. Anything further from their perspective you should ask them, and we're very respectful of that relationship."

Yes, sure. So they're sort of getting term-detailed. We average -- CPI across the jurisdictions that we operate in averages at about 3.6% and that's the $200 million that you see on the left-hand side of the graph. We do see a little bit of above CPI inflation. The way we show that is we net that in our cost and volume benefits, right, because it's our job to sort of drive out above CPI impacts across the business. And so that's how we disclose it. Are we seeing increases? Yes, I've touched upon thing like diesel, obviously off a $70 oil price. Diesel's up. Shipping fuel's up. So your seeing some of those things naturally feed through your cost structure. Apart from that, nothing that I would say terribly untoward, remembering that we operate in jurisdictions that have probably higher-than-average sort of inflation impacts, anyway. So for us it's a little bit of business as usual. That's why we've got to drive those cost and volume improvements, that's why we're so committed to that cost-out journey, because we do see those things coming through, but that was the same the year before and same the year before that. I spoke a little bit at the full year. It's probably a little newer for Australia, particularly in WA and particularly in the Pilbara. They probably had a 5 or 6 year period of deflation, particularly through mining services, where people had spent a lot of capital, there's a lot of capacity there and they were desperately keen just to cover some of their cost to keep the doors open to get through to the next cycle. As those people need to reinvest in the next cycle of capital and capital availability they need returns on that capital. So I think that's what you're starting to see through some of those jurisdictions. Europe been probably a little bit high, just off the back of better growth, and up until recently maybe the U.S. was starting to [ develop ] a little bit too. So it's probably in countries where people haven't seen it it's emerging. For us, I suppose it's a regular part of our business."

On the Mining Charter, I think the best way to characterize our conversations and thoughts, the new charter or the new version is certainly, I think, very helpful in providing us with certainty on our existing assets and operations. And that's a big tick, that's a big positive and very pleased for us. So from our perspective very pleased with the certainty that it provides. There is still couple of things that need to be cleaned up, but much happier and certainly gives us the confidence to continue driving and investing in our existing business. In terms of the new parameters, I think there is some real challenges in there in terms of [ free ] carry, trickle dividend, these other pieces. We've made that very clear. So I think there is a lot of work on both sides of thefence to try and land something that will encourage foreign direct investment. We've made that point pretty clear, the chambers in those conversations. We're certainly in problem-solving mode with the government. We are optimistic in terms of the long-term in South Africa. We want to be part of the future. So we want to make sure that we have a charter on a go-forward basis that encourages investment, but there is still a bit of work to do on that front. So I'm happy with the key parts in that give us confidence in terms of where we are, but some more work to be done on the look-forwards. And I think there is a lot of work still to be done on that front. In terms of the carbon tax, Stephen, you got the number? I can give a rough breakdown."

It was within that range and that's still a conversation at the moment in relation to the new dispensation with Mr. Ramaphosa. It has an impact, but it's not that significant. But we have said that given what you're trying to do, the $100 billion that Mr. Ramaphosa wants to encourage, one of the things we'll be saying is, just have a look at that and consider whether that's the right thing to do, but that's the dialogue that we're in at the moment through Norman and the South African term."

Myles Allsop UBS. Three quick questions. First just continuing the South Africa conversation. The MPRDA Amendment Bill was pretty toxic and that is still floating around. Does that mean the uncertainty in South Africa is going to continue for at least 12, 18 months beyond the charter, kind of being promulgated? And secondly, just on the M&A side. Couple of small acquisitions, just can you give us a sense as to how you as a management team are thinking about M&A going forward? Is it just kind of tacking on small opportunities? Or are you going to get bolder? And then thirdly, the capital allocation going back to the very first question on dividends, how should we think about when the balance sheets are at a point when there is really excess cash? Are we looking at the wrong net debt number? Should it be the net debt outside of South Africa, was it $7 billion ? Has that got to get down to $4 billion before you consider lifting the payouts? Or -- that I think is the area of maybe slight disappointment with these results?"

So I'll come back -- I'll ask Stephen to get the fine points on his answer regarding the capital, but on the MPRDA, it's been floating around ever since I've been working in South Africa, that's 10 years in one form or the other. It's complex, you've got the traditional leaders having input, a whole range of players. I still think it's got a long way to go. For me, it doesn't worry me. I think the Mining Charter conversation captures the essence of the nature of the relationship between the 2 parties and that commitment to not jeopardize existing operations and investments, I think, it's absolutely critical. I think that's a key sentiment we should hold onto. Because I think the MPRDA has still got a fair way to go. And the focus on the charter going forward I think is the other critical element. I think they will then look at harmonizing the 2 and that will take time. So again it's not something I worry about. If you look across the world, the certainty we have in South Africa is certainly pretty robust. It can [ bend ] to many jurisdictions, as some of our colleagues are finding in the industry in the range of places around the world. So we can make South Africa better and we're committed to being part of that dialogue. 
On M&A, look, we've always kept our eye on the market as we should. But the good news is, and Stephen picked up 3 points, and I want to reiterate those 3 points. Firstly, our growth going forward will come from internal efficiencies. The efficiencies I talked about on the slide are available to us in every part of the business and that's the real focus, and Tony and his team, and Seamus with all the operations guys, Bruce and the team, Duncan, everyone, are focused on getting the best of the business and there's still a lot more to be had, so that's the first point. Second point, innovation and step changes. We invested in investment, or in innovation and technology, because we knew that was the best pathway to growth and effective growth in terms of returns on capital. And we are still committed and Tony and the guys have helped us see a lot more opportunity that provides step opportunities in terms of [ improvement ]. And 3, the internal project pipeline. Quellaveco is the, obviously, the large-scale step, but we've got incremental opportunities across the business. So the first thing we need to do is get the best out of the capital assets we have. That's first, second and third priority. At the same time, we can see opportunities that make sense for us, so [ Peregrin ], the [ Mototolo ] conversion and we see some smaller opportunities that make sense and provide us with the ability to continue to improve our performance across the organization. And again, our focus on exploration provides us with the pathway of very value accretive growth. So it fits as part of an overall strategy. But we think we're in a better position than most because we got those internal opportunities. If there is something that's out there that make sense, we will follow it up, we can convert it, we demonstrated we can. But when you got the opportunities we've got, why would you chase stuff that has a higher level of risk. But not saying we won't, but it's got to make sense and it's got to compete with all those great opportunities we got inside the portfolio."

To answer the second part of your question on dividends. Maybe just focus on this half result first of all. So I think generally most numbers that I saw were pretty spot on in terms of EBITDA. There was a little bit of variance across EPS, given 2 things. One was effective tax rate, it's probably a little bit higher than people were assuming, and that's largely a profit mix thing. So we had sort of higher profits continuing through Australia and South America with slightly higher effective tax rates in the half. So that's why you saw that the effective tax rate a little bit higher than average. The other one is depreciation, where people were just a little bit off on, and that's -- we have had new assets commence and we have had increased volumes come through. So the combination of those 2, I think, whether 100 to 200 perhaps that a few people were missing on depreciation. If that flowed through there may be a different expectation on the cents number of earnings -- underlying earnings and therefore on dividend. For a couple of really sensible reasons, we are committed to that 40% payout policy. So in the near term, I think that's what you should put in your spreadsheets and that's what you should expect. Ultimately, we will always work our way around that capital allocation wheel and as you get towards the sort of the end of that consideration, one of them is additional returns to shareholders. But as a priority, I would say, the balance sheet still outweighs that in terms of just making sure it's absolutely rock solid, as we come into more of an investment phase for the company. So I think it's an absolutely right thing for us to stay focused on. Yes, net debt -- consolidated net debt is one view. I should point out the rest of the world debt, I would like to get that a little bit closer and a little bit more aligned right across the balance sheet. That is part of the reason why we remain focused on de-gearing."

Tyler Broda, RBC Capital Markets. I have 2 questions. One and half, but question #1a is for diamonds. You're matching the production to the pricing environment, it sounds like things are starting to get bit better in the diamond industry. Venetia is going through the transition. So would you be able to give a guide for where you could get production up to, say over the next 2 years if the market supported it in terms of volumes? And then the question 1b is on thermal coal. In terms of the -- looking at the group structures you walked through on those charts on cost repositioning, the one thing that struck me is interesting, is that thermal coal sort of seems a bit different than a lot of your other assets, shorter mine life, you're getting towards the end of life at a couple of the assets, more weight of the assay, it's got CSR that's coming up in thermal coal these days. I guess, the question is that with the rest of your portfolio, having improved as much it has, does thermal coal still fit?"

Okay. In diamonds, we are very sensitive to make sure that we're not running ahead of the market. So we're very happy with what we see, and we are supplying to the market and we have a little bit of flex in terms of what we can do. But as we go through the transition with Venetia, and we're making other changes, we don't want to stress that system in the next couple of years. We want to make sure that we're focused on getting our efficiencies right, getting our margins right and not putting more product out there that we might otherwise do better in 2 or 3 years time in getting that balance right. So Bruce and guys are watching that very carefully. If they had to kick up a million carats, I think we got the capacity, depending upon where we are and what we are doing. Longer term we had closer to the 37 million carats towards the 4- and 5-year period. But again that's based on the transition that we go through for Venetia and making sure we're getting the best out of the other assets. So we got the potential there, but at the same time, we are trying to match that to the market so that we keep the margins in a healthy place. Bruce, do you want to cover that. On thermal coal, Seamus did a very good speech a few weeks back to the staff, and if I can borrow on how he presented the story, which I think it's exactly the right way to present it, we got very good assets in thermal coal, very good cost position. We are low quartile, we're right on the cusp, and we can improve with our productivity. There have been very significant, what about 40%, 50% productivity improvement in South African the last 3, 3.5 years. We've got 14 years life on average. And from our point of view, it make sense to continue to run those quality assets through that process and we are making sensible capital allocations on incremental life extensions. It would certainly be a lot harder for us to justify a big investment in thermal coal that goes beyond the 7-year lifetime on the basis that there are questions about the value that you will see in thermal coal relative to oil, gas and the whole fossil fuel question. So we think committing our capital to Quellaveco and other incremental projects make sense, but we won't start the business of capital and we make sensible decisions. When we talk about the transition, we've halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 5 years and we call it a just transition. We're connecting with our communities. We're making sure they understand what we're doing in those local communities. The governments and the customers that we work for understand exactly how we're going, and we are making incremental investments. But it will be a lot tougher for us to justify a big investment for a long term development position in thermal coal, given the uncertainties in the price environment. So it would have to be a very special case. So carefully considered, measured as we go and we will keep the market and everyone else informed, because the CSR conversation is very important one to us. And one that we are very cognizant of, but at the same time, we're not going to bail out tomorrow and many of the CSR stakeholders are very appreciative of the fact that we haven't run, that we had been clear about the transition, they said, we prefer that because we understand the importance of the local communities. We understand the importance of those industries to the big power stations, and it's better to have a responsible operator like you transitioning with those assets than having some other characters running those assets in a way that may not be as sensitive as the way you guys will run it. So we're trying to get the balance right."

I think we're going to do a little bit about diversity in the script. Welcome, thanks for joining us this morning. I would like to acknowledge a few of my colleagues this morning before I start. Chairman Chambers. Welcome, Stuart. My colleagues on the management committee are sprinkled through the audience. And we've also got Tom McCulley, who is the Project Executive for Quellaveco. He is joining us today. I think he's shopping a plane tonight to Peru. And Ruben Fernandes, Ruben's fresh from Minas-Rio where he has been cleaning the pipeline, so I'm sure he'd be happy to have a chat with couple of you during the course of the morning. And a few of my other colleagues, I see Craig Miller is here as well.
So can I encourage all of you to take advantage of having a few people around? You can ask whatever questions you want. And hopefully, we can provide you the insights you need to help understand where we are, where we've come from and where we're going.
Today, we'll stick pretty well with the format. I'll talk about business performance just briefly, give an overview, talk about where we've come in terms of the last 5 years, some of the work we've done on positions of the business. Stephen will talk about the financial results and unpack the numbers, which I think is very important. So there is a few moving parts here in this set of results that need to be explained. I'll pick up again on capital allocation. Obviously, the conversation around Quellaveco is an important part of that conversation and really does reflect our focus and a different approach to the way we allocate capital. And then just pick up some details on the foundations that we have created and why we believe we've set ourselves up for the next 5 years. It'll look quite different to where we've been. Most importantly though, I think, talking about the lessons we've learned over the last 5 years and how those lessons are being applied into how we think about and how we'll execute the continuing improvement journey that we're focused on over the next 5 years.
And with that, we'll kick straight into performance. From an operating performance point of view, continuing improvement in the operations performance. Our $400 million improvement in the first half reflects that -- half of that $800 million commitment for the full year. Again, Stephen will unpack those numbers just to help you understand where we've got that from.
Earnings and cash flow reflect continuing improvement in the business. Our EBITDA is up 11%. Attributable free cash flow, when you pull apart the one-offs compared to last year is pretty solid, but we need to continue to improve. 
On margins and returns, we've improved our EBITDA margin to 41%, and our return on capital employed is 19%. So it's a solid set of results, more we can do. And certainly, we're focused on continuing the trends to improve and make sure we've got the business that can deliver consistently.
On safety, health and environment, important place for us to start. Unfortunately, we've reported 2 fatalities in the first half and, in fact, we had a third fatal incident in July. So still a lot of work to be done. We have improved. But from my point of view, these aren't a good set of results until we're at 0. And so that quest continues. The elimination of fatalities task force work is starting to get a real momentum. So I think we're in the middle of impacting that performance and, certainly, a 31% improvement in the total frequency rate for the half is encouraging, but nowhere near where we want to be. So encouragement, but a lot more work to be done. 
Health, the numbers are good. We continue to focus on a broad range of issues with our work force. 
On the environmental side, again a solid set of results, but I would say, the disappointment, obviously, Minas-Rio. Of the 4 incidents that we reported in the first half, the Minas-Rio leaks with 2 of those incidents. Lot of work going on now. As we stand today, we are in the middle of the process of inspecting the pipe. We are setting up to replace around 4 kilometers of pipe. So that's been ordered. It's all being done. The preparation work is being done. We're working with the authorities to make sure that we've got appropriate independent advice and that we're connecting to the authorities so that the appropriate regulatory approvals move through fairly quickly. So we're still on track to start producing again by the end of the year, but there is still a fair bit of work to be done and to make sure that we fully understand the mechanism. We believe we do, but I want to wait till all of the inspections are done to make sure we've got every angle covered. So a lot of work going on, and, again, both Seamus and Ruben are here, if you'd like to understand a little bit more. After our sessions, you're more than welcome to chat to the guys.
On productivity and improvement, generally, through the operations, as you know, productivity continues to improve. For us, volumes are up 8% over the last 5 years, and the key number, obviously, number of assets. So when we either took fairly drastic action in either closing or selling assets, we pulled out about 15% to 17% of our productive capacity. So the fact that we're up 8% reflects improved performance from the existing assets. And on average, it's about 30% uplift in performance across the existing asset or the current asset suite. We've also had a couple of contributions from assets coming into the mix, Grosvenor, for example, but they're still not yet at full capacity. So our productivity should continue to improve over the course of the next 18 months. And for us, that's very important because we want to continue to improve our operating costs and our competitive positions.
On numbers, in terms of people, there has been a significant reduction. We've gone from around 160,000 down to 95,000. We will continue to tighten the cost structure up within the business, so those numbers will continue to reduce, but we're making sure that we do that with all of our employees. But that's where the focus is to continue to improve our cost position.
I just wanted to give a little bit of sense or to give you a little sense of what does an average 30% improvement look like across the business. So this slide is a slide around Mogalakwena. It could easily be Sishen. It could be Moranbah. It could be Grasstree. It could be Kolomela. It could be Los Bronces, you get the picture. 
So at Mogalakwena, on mining, our shovel productivities have gone from 1,700 to 2,300. There is still a long way to improve. The last 5 years, we're up 5% -- 34%, sorry, and we still see significant performance potential in the assets, but that's been encouraging in terms of the underlying mixed shovel productivities across the group.
On truck utilization, we're up 20%, almost 20%. It's actually at 20%, now. We've gone from 5,400 hours per truck to 6,500 hours per truck. So it also helps explain why our sustaining capital numbers have been improving as well. So we're getting more out of the assets we have. 
In terms of the concentrators and tonnes processed, we're up 35%. And so, whilst we've improved the north concentrator and the south concentrator, we did add some incremental volumes with BAOBAB, but overall the underlying efficiency improvements in our operations is north of 20%. Again that's very important and not $1 of capital is being spent on any of those improvements.
At the same time, we've gone from 74% recovery of payable material to 80% recovery. So the volumes are up. And without putting new storage or other capacity in, we've been able to improve our underlying recoveries by 8%. So that's straight to the bottom line. So that's been significant. So we're improving both the volumes and the quality of the work that's being done. As a consequence of that improvement and with the way we set the pit up, and if you can recall 3, 4 years ago, we talked about rescheduling the pit, over the next 15 years, we've got some improvements in grade. And when you add all of that up together, we've seen a 60% increase in production of precious metals.
So we're now at or around 1 million ounces of precious metals. We talk about platinum, but for us, it's about all the payables and that's north of 1 million ounces payable. Today, our margin is 45%, even though the platinum price has dropped 30%, that's been significant. And the real story, and this all adds up to -- and this is equivalent platinum cost, we've gone from $994 back in 2012 to $250 an ounce. So Chris' target of 0 platinum cost is alive and well. There is still a lot of potential, and we think we can get there. Obviously, grade will play some part in that. But from our point of view, 75% reduction, or if you want to talk margins, we've gone from a 40% margin to a 45% margin, despite a 30% reduction in the price of the products we produce. And that's really a big part of the story in terms of getting platinum from net $1.5 billion debt to a net cash position at the half year. So in a pretty strong place and so very pleased with that. And again that's a number of assets that I could talk to in those same terms so Sishen, Kolomela, a full portfolio.
Importantly, it's improving our competitive position across our commodities. So in 2013 -- the best data we had for the business is 2014. But if you look at the positions across the quartile cost curves, these are the positions by commodity that we occupied back in 2013, '14. So as a consequence of portfolio, operating efficiencies and some of the new innovation stuff that we're starting to tinker with and introduce into the operation, which will become a much bigger part of the story in the next 5 years, we've started to see improvements in our relative position. So this means we're moving quicker in those areas where you're seeing we're going to the right in terms of cost positions relative to competitors. So copper has gone from 71% to the 57 percentile. Quellaveco, being Q1, will take us mid-Q2. So again, a very important addition to the portfolio in terms of the quality of the copper business.
Met coal, Moranbah, in particular, Grosvenor will still -- will start to make a significant contribution, and Grass Tree have taken us to the top of the league table in terms of longwall operations moving us again to the left. So Seamus [ in the mid-term ] has done a great job in the Met Coal business. In De Beers, general focus on cost, Gahcho Kué is making a good contribution. So again moving to the left with more to be done. 
In platinum, you know the Mogalakwena story, but we are improving other assets, including Amandelbult. A lot more to be done in those assets and a lot more potential still at Mogalakwena, but a good shift to the left. In nickel, Barro Alto got the furnaces sorted out. From what we can judge in the Nickel business, Barro Alto now is the -- one of the very few major new nickel assets that are actually -- hit the design capacity. And if you remember the problems we had with the furnaces, we redid the furnaces and now are at full rate. And again, Ruben has been the leader of the business for some years now and is probably the best in control asset that we've got across the group. And we've got a lots of success stories, but in terms of nickel, those furnaces are really starting to set the trend and the benchmark for us as a business to follow in terms of running an asset well.
In thermal coal, story not as positive. We pulled up capital in Cerrejón with our partners on the basis that we didn't think it was the right time or we weren't spending that capital as well as we could. So we pulled a bit to the right. We've also got 2 assets getting close to end of life. So that's impacted the costs. Over the next 3 to 4 years, [ rate ] will start to come out of the system. So we'll move again to the left, but there is more work to be done on productivity and Seamus can talk about some of the things he is working on at the moment in thermal coal, in particular, in South Africa.
In iron ore, you guys know the story pretty well, a lot of new capacity in the Pilbara and in Brazil has been built. So the curve's shunted to the right. In our case, we've more than halved our controllable cost at Kumba. But even with that, we've not been able to complete at this level, but we've closed the gap to the Pilbara and Brazil. And in fact, I think 3 of the months last year towards the end of the year, where premium -- quality premiums and lump premiums were pretty good. We're actually middle Q2. So for us, the target is $10 a tonne either through premiums and cost, that would give us a 35 breakeven landed in China, gets us in this range. So Seamus and the guys and Themba know what has to be done in the next 3 to 5 years, that's -- we're in pursuit of trying to get ourselves on the bottom half of the cost curve.
Minas-Rio at full rate is mid-Q2 as well by strong quality and cost around 35 landed in China. So there is work to be done. We know what we've got to do, but there is still more to be done to get ourselves to the left-hand side of the cost curve. So today 2018, we've moved from 52 percentile to 46 percentile. We have a view on how we've done against our competitors. We've done well, we think, but it's a constant analysis from our point of view because we've got to keep driving ourselves to the left. So in each of those businesses, we know what we've got to do to get ourselves to the left. We've got to try and get there quicker than our competitors, and that's the imperative, that's the focus and that's what I'll talk about when I talk about things a little bit later in terms of the 5 years. So today, if you remember, we were predominantly here. We've moved a lot of the businesses into the second quartile, but we've still got more work to do. And certainly, we know how to get there in copper, and Seamus and the guys are very focused on getting us there in iron ore as well.
As a consequence, from 2012, we're up to 41% margin. That is against a lower price deck for our commodities. So our 23% reduction in cost, which is the nominal number or about 30% real has helped us move up the margin curve. And we know and -- that includes, sorry, I should say, also includes the marketing work that Peter and the team have been doing, so that's been important in terms of our margins. 
Over the next 5 years -- 3 to 5 years, we'll continue with the efficiency work. Our innovation and technology work is set to make a more significant contribution in the 3- to 5-year range. And again, Tony can describe some of the things that we've got going. And with -- obviously, with Quellaveco and the smaller projects that we're starting to put onto the launching pad, there is a real push to head us towards the 50% type margin, clearly, subject to price. But on an apples-to-apples basis, we know where we've got to go and what we're driving towards.
So with that, I'll hand across to Steve. He will unpack the number."

So it's a really good set of numbers. It's a clean set of numbers. Importantly, it sort of simply shows where we're focusing our efforts as we run the business and as we prioritize the themes that we want to do internally. And those priorities really continue around a balanced approach. So it's a balanced approach around returns to shareholders, capital allocation and ongoing focus on the balance sheet. And the same themes that you saw in the last 6 months prior, you're seeing in these 6 months and you'll see again in the next 6 months. The journey continues. We'll also unpack a little bit about the EBITDA drivers and will finish on the report card that we talked to.
So we speak a lot about our focus on cost and volume. And the reason we do that is because we know from time to time at different parts of the cycle, we will come under pressure from inflation and other sort of cost increases. This half, we delivered $400 million of the $800 million target that we set for this year, and that $400 million takes us to $4.6 billion since 2012.
What are we've seen in terms of some of those cost increases, and we touched on this theme a little bit at the full year results, so increased diesel price given the higher oil price, but that's the same for everyone really across the industry. We're seeing increased energy prices, particularly Schiedam in South Africa, and that can reflect itself either in electricity prices or in infrastructure charges if those things also use energy. And we've also seen a little bit of wages and salary growth again South Africa, South America, in particular. But that's the reason why we stay focused on these cost and volume improvements, so we stay ahead of the curve. So let's have a quick talk at this slide. So we'll move across left to right. So in terms of prices, PGM is up, largely driven by palladium and rhodium.
Copper, thermal coal: also up. In terms of currency, a little bit of a mixed bag. In terms of currencies, probably the most noticeable one was the strengthening of the ZAR through the half, so the South African Rand through the half, and that softened right towards the end of June 30. 
Inflation, I've touched on. Minas-Rio, we'll highlight separately for you through the year, so that you can just clearly understand the impact that has first and second half. The good news is, we are on track in terms of the inspection and repair work. Garden is unchanged in terms of coming on at the end of the fourth quarter. And really, as we look forward to '19, a little bit of positive momentum into earnings as that comes back on stream.
I just want to step away for a moment from this half's numbers and just look a little bit forward as we look at that sort of cost and volume improvement journey that's ahead of us. So you recall, at the full year, we outlined our target over the next 5 years from the start of '18 to the end of '22, $3 billion to $4 billion improvement that we're looking for. And there is really 3 broad buckets. So I just want to give you a touch of a little more detail to help you understand where the focus is.
So the first bucket is operational efficiency. You'll hear us talk internally and probably a little more externally about [ P 101 ], and it's sort of the catchphrase that we have internally that really talks about getting to benchmark and beyond. So full potential plus is sort of another phrase of how we explain it. And even though we've had a great journey in some of the assets, and Mark spoke about Mogalakwena before, there is still a real opportunity in front of us. And we've improved Mogalakwena. We've improved Sishen. We've improved cutting rights and things from Moranbah-Grosvenor, but we still have real opportunity in front of us to get to benchmark and beyond and really sort of set the trend for the industry. And that's across all the diggers, all the trucks, processing plant, recovery, it's everywhere. We've got that same mentality as we look for those improvement opportunities.
When you do start to approach [ P 101 ], you've got to start to make some choices. How do you take that benefit? Do you take that benefit in terms of cost out? Do you park up trucks? Do you park up diggers? Do you take that benefit in terms of increased production, if you can get it to market down infrastructure? Or is it some combination of both? Is it a focus on grade and quality of product, so that you're maximizing your margin of what you earn for each tonne? So they're the sort of choices that we have to make as we go forward, great choices and great opportunities to have to think through. It's a really, really great challenge as we look and think about the business all the way from mine to market and think about how we maximize that value equation.
Second bucket is around technology and innovation. And here I suppose I want to give you a sense that we're moving out of the lab and into the field, right? So we really have a quite a neat schedule as we roll out some of these production test units across some of our operations. So in the concentrated mine it's about bulk sorting. What is that? It's about more precisely getting the cut-off grade right by separating, prior to the main processing plant, the lower grade element of what we're about to put through the plant. So the aim there is a 10% to 20% increase in feed grade through the processing plant. We're about to put the first of those units into El Soldado, should be in about end of August, September timing. I think that's Jwaneng. And then early next year, it'll be at Barro Alto and Mogalakwena. So those things really starting to go live and roll out across the operations.
In copper, we're probably more certain of the benefit. Platinum, still doing some early phase work to make sure that we're going to get those sorts of benefits. On coarse particle flotation, so remember that's sort of coarser grinding, so that we get -- we use less energy. So the target there is 30% more throughput, a smaller recovery loss, maybe 3%, and that should get us 20% less energy, 30% less water. Again, copper will be the first rollout of that at El Soldado and that will really be through the early half of 2019.
The third bucket's really about project delivery, and Mark's touched on some of those themes. We've spoken about them before, Moranbah-Grosvenor and debottlenecking, potentially an extra vessel in Debmarine, Quellaveco coming in at the end of '22. So lots of opportunities in front of us. Again, the commitment across the whole organization to chase these things, really quite exciting for us at the moment, the momentum and enthusiasm that we've got across all of the operations.
Okay, so back to some of today's results. The main message here is really about stability of earnings and effectiveness of capital allocation. So from a stability of earnings point of view, 3% increase in EPS, 6% increase in return-on-capital employed to 19%.
Looking at cash flow. So we did have a really strong 2017. So we did have a number of sort of one-offs benefits that flowed through 2017, which you are now seeing a more normalized level of sort of cash flow on a half-to-half basis. So last time around some of the one-offs, we had slightly lower cash tax. We just restarted the dividend post the half year. So we had less minority leakage. We had lower CapEx. We had a bit of working capital release in the first half of last year. So a more normalized state this time around. If you normalize for those things, you have a good increase period-on-period, strong cash flow for the half.
Turning to the balance sheet. Focus on net debt reductions continued, a further $0.5 billion down to $4 billion. It remains a priority for us, as I said earlier, and we are determined still to take advantage of this window of opportunity that we have before we have to put our hand in our pocket to -- for CapEx on Quellaveco.
At $4 billion, we're probably really at the low end of -- we're very, very comfortable with where the debts hits for this part of the cycle. So remember, I spoke last time around about the way I look at the balance sheet across 3 key metrics. So absolute net debt level, obviously, strength of the balance sheet. Net debt-to-EBITDA strength of the underlying cash flow, although that can obviously move with volatility and commodity prices and, obviously, net gearing or net leverage ratios really goes to the heart of the strength of the balance sheet even through those cycles. We will remain focused on all 3. Our guidance for the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at 1 to 1.5x. We don't want to exceed that for any long period through the lows of the cycle. Obviously, we're at incredibly attractive levels as we should be for this part of the cycle. Ideally, we want to set this balance sheet up so that we can be counter-cyclical if opportunities emerge in the years ahead.
So in terms of returns to shareholders, we're committed to the payout policy, 40% of underlying earnings per share, $0.49 for the period, slightly nudged up from where we were in the prior half. So with this dividend that takes our returns to shareholders to $1.9 billion since we restarted the dividend this time last year. That's about a 4% yield. Just to tick over, I think, on today's prices. So just to wrap it up, then how did we go in terms of report card? So prior to discretionary capital, $1.8 billion of cash flow. What did we do with it? Net debt down $0.5 billion, final dividend $700 billion in terms of -- $700 million in terms of returns to shareholders and a few other bits and pieces. Discretionary capital $200 million for the half. Obviously, that will tick up a little bit through the second half of 2019. So as I say, continued journey, continued trends, a good journey that we're on. Mark, back to you."

People ask me about the ship in terms of capital discipline. When I look at Bruce, if I could just make a simple point, one of those incremental improvements that we've got available to us is to build and put on the water a new ship, represents a 1 year payback. That's what we're about. Efficiency of capital, getting good returns. And that typifies or exemplifies our perfect project [ 12-1 payback ].
For us, when we look at the business, we talk about the commodity positions, I'd like to stress the point that the positions we have by commodity are a function of our focus on quality assets. It's our focus on quality assets that determines where we put our capital and where we develop. The good news for us in copper, the fundamentals are strong. We've got a great position, and we're able to convert that opportunity and something very real with Quellaveco. And many are pursuing copper in the industry, we've got some great internal options both from a greenfields perspective, a brownfields perspective. And longer term, we think our exploration work will position us even further in terms of the industry, so a great position to be in.
In terms of -- I'm sorry, I should go back, just finish the story. In terms of diamonds, we continue to supply to demand. And as we see demand growing, we've got the ability to flex. We are transitioning in a couple parts of the business. Obviously, Venetia going from open cut to underground. So that's a transition story at the moment. Gahcho Kué hitting [ and strapped ], certainly, continuing improvements. Obviously, Debmarine and Jwaneng, important contributors in terms of the business. And certainly, the prognosis looks pretty good going forward, certainly very encouraging. 
On PGM, big focus on Mogalakwena and its ability to make continuing improvements and a major or a significantly improved contribution. But in particular, for us right at the moment, a lot more work to be done at Amandelbult. And so still continuing our journey down the cost curve. A lot   of work to be done. Very focused, Chris and his team are very focused there. And clearly, the big contribution from bulks. If you look at the numbers from bulks over the last couple of years, they've been exceptional. Moranbah, the Grosvenor ramp-up continues. So from our point of view, lots of incremental opportunities in that business to improve that contribution and, certainly, the contribution in the last 2 years has been significant and will continue to be strong, given the improving performance across the business.
For us, the potential or the focus on portfolio upgrading has continued. Obviously, we'll talk about Quellaveco in a couple of minutes. PGM's union mine, we've completed the sale. BRPM sale continues our focus on really focusing on those assets that can move the dial for us. The Mototolo acquisition should be really thought about -- firstly, we know the asset, we know the resource. The purchase position with Glencore is about extending from the 5-year life to a 30-year life, with a connection to Der Brochen. That doesn't mean we're going to go out and do anything significant today. What it does do is provide us a long-term option in terms of the business. It's not the right time in the market to go and spend something new in terms of the asset, but positioning ourselves very important in terms of quality assets for the long term, and we see this as a good move. 
Thermal coal, you're aware of the completion of the transactions on the tied mines along with New Largo. And in De Beers, we haven't been standing with our feet in the mud. Lightbox, a very important step in terms of the business and, again, Bruce is here, if you'd like a bit more insight into that, happy to answer any questions. And obviously, the offer for Peregrine flags an approach for us that's very important. The world is short of diamonds. There will be significant shortfall by 2022. So we're positioning ourselves with options in terms of going into the market. But again, it's market-led, making sure that we're doing the right things and spending our money in a smart way.
Quellaveco, some have observed that the photo does indicate that we have been active in the last 2 or 3 years. The actual number, Jason, is about $500 million in terms of investment in value in the ground, in keeping the option open. But I think it's been money well invested in terms of understanding the geotechnical issues, understanding the big issues that you don't know about before you make those big commitments and most importantly, it's been an investment in the community and the commitments that we made to the community. So in terms of those relationships, absolutely critical in a place like Peru, and we certainly got the support of the local committee. So it's been an important part of the work.
On Quellaveco itself, obviously, returns, key focus for us, making sure that we get the discipline right. Internal rate of return works off the midpoint of the range that we talked about in terms of the capital, the $5 billion to $5.3 billion. Return on capital employed is north of 20% when we hit that full production rate and through the first 10 years, and our payback post first production is 4 years, so for us very important metrics. And if you look at the key hurdles that we set ourselves in terms of our capital allocation processes 4 years ago, it ticks each one of those boxes.
In terms of the asset itself, low cost. And I'll unpack why the costs are as low as they are. Long life, obviously, the resource is significant. We do see significant long-term potential beyond the 30 years. And I think the address in terms of who is next to us tells you there is a good story or good potential story there in the long term. 
Capital discipline, the commitment to the syndication and the partnership with Mitsubishi was very important. And as Stephen indicated, we won't be required to put our hand in our pocket in funding our share until well into 2019. So that's an important point to make in terms of the balance sheet and our continuing journey in reducing our debt.
In terms of being execution-ready, it's permitted. The social credentials is where we had been investing and working very hard with the local community, they're very strong. And from the dialogue tabled in 2012, it's been a real success story in terms of the conversations. Interestingly, the Governor, [ the Chair, ] the round table in 2012 is now the President of the country. And so I think he is probably more excited than we are in terms of the commitment, and we'll be standing with him next week, talking about that in the context of Peru. So very strong support from the government right the way through the local community, which is something that's very important in all of our jurisdictions and particularly Peru.
Again, execution-ready. In terms of the community support, we've actually committed through the life of the project, $300 million in community investment programs. And it's not the investment programs that we think they should have. They are the investment programs that they've asked us to help them with in being a true partner in the community. And it is different -- it's a different approach, it's a different conversation, and we think critical to ensure continuity and cost competitiveness of the project you need your local community in there as a partner.
Our key permits are in place. The construction program is as good as I have seen in my 42 years in the industry. Clearly, we've had a long time to bake this cake and we've done a lot of the pre-work and we've applied all the lessons that we could, plus some, out of our previous adventures, or misadventures in some cases. So I think it's well set up and we're well set up for success. Tom's here to lead the project, but Duncan, Tony, all of the GMC members have been active participants in making sure that we've looked at this from every angle.
The syndication, I think, was an important message to everyone that we are serious about thinking about a different investment model for the industry. Yes, it borrows somewhat from the oil and gas sector in terms of sharing that risk. We've got a good partnership with Mitsubishi. We know them well, they know us well, and certainly from our point of view, we think it's a win-win for both of us as an organization. And when I talk about returns, the fact that we've been able to book a profit on some of the investments we have made has actually helped us return a little bit better IRR return than we're reporting at the project level. So the good news is it actually enhances our returns as well, and we think that's smart to do, in putting a little bit of that profit back in our pocket and using that to help fund the early parts of the progress and keep our balance sheet in good shape and able to support the continuing improvements across other parts of the portfolio. So again we think it's a win-win for us and for all parts of our business.
The returns, very important. You've seen the headline numbers I've talked about. I think the EBITDA margin -- we talked about that 50% target for us as a group. This helps us achieve that type of improvement in our margins. The construction capital, and this is our share post-syndication, in the range $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. I think it's important to focus on as well as in terms of Anglo American's financial commitment to building the project. And from our point of view, in 2018, our share will be around $400 million, so it will be fully funded from the proceeds that we received from Mitsubishi and that goes well into '19 as well.
Unit operating cost for the first 10 years, $1.05. In fact with the softer material in the first 5 years, it's a bit below that. The structural cost advantages are important for people to understand. It's low-strip ratio, below one. Secondly, for the first 10 years most of the haul is downhill. So you've got low-cost haulage costs and the labor cost and the energy cost are very competitive. They are not a pittance as some would be in other parts of the world. In Peru, it's a developed country. It's a progressive country, the productivities are good, the pays are good, but more competitive than some of the other jurisdictions. So from our point of view the structural cost base is very good. Hydropower is also an advantage in terms of the energy. So it's a good mix and we're making a good contribution in terms of the organization. And it's also sustainable because the pay rates are very competitive on a broader basis. Production 300,000 tonne a year for the first 10 years. It'll be a bit higher than that the first 5, again as a consequence of the softer material going through the plant very quickly. 
Cost position, as we said, we will improve our cost position as a consequence of Quellaveco. It will move us solidly into Q2. If you remember the copper position on the top curve. So that's an important step for us, again a continuing focus on improving the portfolio.
Can you give us a kick on the slide? Thank you. The start of the resource unit, I think the big thing with copper deposits, we're in a great address. So the 2 southern copper assets that flank us have been long-term assets, very successful assets. And certainly from our point of view, the address is a great address. The mineralization is pretty well known. And from our point of view, it's open to depth, certainly in one direction. So we would expect beyond the 40 years from the project, and if you look at the resource base, obviously, significant. We would like to think it's beyond 60 years, a lot of work to be done, obviously, to prove those sorts of numbers, but significant potential. If you look at history in terms of Los Bronces growth since 2004, same with Collahuasi, we think it's one of those types of deposits that becomes a long-term foundation for the group. And so a very important commitment and I think well priced, great returns and for the long-term is a changing -- or is a portfolio changer for us as a group.
So on the foundations that we've set or have been setting and with Quellaveco being another step toward building on those foundations, I think it's important to just reflect for a moment that today if you looked at where we were 5 years ago, our average life of mine was somewhere between 20 and 25 years. Today, we are at 30 years across the portfolio. Our thermal coal assets have got the shortest life of about 14 years and some assets have got beyond 100, [ i.e. ] the Mogalakwena. Our target is, in the next 5 years is to make sure we maintain that life as a minimum. There are opportunities to increase the life, which will then ultimately underpin future growth in the asset base, again connected to the markets. But with that type of asset base, we're in a unique position and certainly, unique in our industry and it gives us the ability to focus on that underlying improvement for the long term. So every time we make an improvement, we've got 30 years to bank the results, and that's critical and that is different in our industry to many of our competitors. 
So we've also got a list of opportunities in each of those commodity positions that provide us with the opportunity to grow, and we're forecasting as Stephen talked about, a 3% growth year-on-year through to 2022. And we have the options that go well beyond that type of configuration or that time frame. So Sakatti for example, is something that could follow a Quellaveco, market conditions permitting. But it's a smaller asset, low capital base, high margins, great returns. So we've got a number of those types of opportunities across the portfolio. 
Something that we'll start to talk about in the next year or 2 is exploration. Through the tough times in '15 and '16, we didn't stop committing to exploration and technical innovation. And I think today, we're starting to see the benefits of that commitment in terms of what we're doing on the ground. So in terms of our exploration strategy, Tony and the team redefined our approach to exploration, a step back, big regional positions, think about exploration in a very different way. And so we're focused on key geographies. The innovation work that we're doing now is being applied to our approach to exploration. And for us, it's all about value. And certainly from our point of view, we think the exploration team is starting to show real value for the commitment that we've shown in the last 2 or 3 years, in particular. And today, we've got some really interesting positions. For those that have been tracking us, you're probably aware that we drilled some holes in Brazil, 6 holes. We've stopped. We've actually pegged out fairly substantial land position. I think it's 5x the size of Kent, or in Australia, it's about the size of [ Gina's ] backyard. 
It is a significant position. And certainly, from our point of view, it's a very interesting place to be. We think we may be sitting on a porphyry, but there is a lot of work still to be done. Early days, but we'll keep you posted in terms of the process over next 6 to 18 months. And our brownfields opportunities, we've been doing a lot of drilling around Mogalakwena, Los Bronces both from an underground potential and extensions to the existing operation and obviously the Quellaveco district. So we're not going to do much more than let you know that this is becoming a very important part of our portfolio and the future options that we have. 
Again, focus on asset quality as a consequence, revenue by product, quite a mixed bag. So that from our point of view, it really is different, and we're providing different set of options to the marketplace. And in our case, the quality of the assets that underpin those revenue streams are very strong. So from our perspective, we think it's differentiated, it's unique. Capital employed by geography over time has been balancing pretty well, South Africa at 26%, used to be up near 50%. We are getting the balance right, certainly from our point of view, we think the risk profile in terms of the revenue base is starting to balance out quite nicely. And that will continue to balance out over the next 3 to 5 years with the commitment to Quellaveco, certainly improving that balance across key geographies. 
I just turned the thing off, that wasn't helpful. In terms of are we positioned in commodities for the future. We're well positioned in electrification and innovation. A greener world, PGMs, in particular, copper is part of that world. In terms of coking coal, the quality of our coking coal and the quality of our iron ore is playing very much into the China environmental story. We think the premiums on those products will certainly remain as China and other locations focus on quality and making sure that it's both efficiency and clean production from those sources. So we think that's important. And growing middle-class, platinum jewelry, diamonds, those other products, are all playing into those sectors. So again there as a consequence of our differentiation across the portfolio, we're playing into the right market segments in terms of use of raw materials and products. 
And finally, for us, again, it's about assets. We're building the capabilities inside the organization to take advantage of the quality we have inside the asset base. And for us, it's about cash flow, it's about the efficiency of those cash flows as measured in return on capital and it's about being sustainable from safety all the way through to the social contract we have with the partners in developing new opportunities in the business, absolutely critical. And that's the Anglo American story. So I'm very happy to take questions."

Whilst obviously positive that you've restarted dividend, maybe the range maybe looks a little bit skinny relative to some of your peers. Can you just comment on why given the strength of balance sheet you don't adopt maybe greater flexibility and a higher payout ratio going forward? And then finally, on cost control. Copper looked like the one area that stood out as having a reduction in unit costs during the period. Some of that seems to be grade related. Could you just maybe give us some guidance in how should we think about copper unit costs second half of this year and also 2019 and maybe some more detailed guidance on grades."

The recent kick in copper grade has helped us in the last 12 months reduce our cost. But if you look at the trend over the 5 years it's north of 20% in real terms, and Collahuasi has made a significant move down the cost curve as a consequence of improving efficiencies and a little bit of growth.

Yes. I mean just a way into the cost story. So yes, it was a great half for copper. Currency and a bit of inflation went against us, but going with us was obviously both the volume increase, grade as you said, and some byproduct credits also sort of played into that. So a good outcome and Duncan has assured me he is going to keep delivering for the second half so that, again, I'd expect us to come inside our previous guidance. Generally, across the other commodities, I suppose the same part of that last theme. So mixed impacts in terms of currency and volumes, grade, et cetera, but generally we're inside and tracking inside of our full year guidance for most of the commodities. Coming to your other topics. So Quellaveco CapEx. So we are guiding that we will spend $400 million on a 100% basis for the balance of this -- $300 million to $400 million for the balance of this calendar year. That will be funded from the proceeds, from the sell down. Some of those proceeds will then carry on through into next year. And so on the first phase, largely through that first half, will also be funded from those proceeds, and it's really then, let's call it mid-next year that will start to contribute on a 60-40 basis. So if you recall in the announcement of the sell down, it's about $833 million comes in and that's the $500 plus gross-up comes into the account. So it's the 834th millionth dollar that then gets funded on the 60-40 basis, if that's the correct [ THs ] and all those sorts of things. We're not guiding at the moment in terms of the exact split. When we come out with capital guidance for '19, we will give you a better split and those sort of things, but it is a fairly typical sort of project spend profile. So years sort of '19 -- years '20, '21 will probably be the largest spends and then it will ease back in '22 as we get to the end. In terms of dividend policy, listen, we were really happy with the 40% sort of guidance and payout ratio when we struck it, and we still think it strikes the right balance. Now remember for us, it's not about one thing or the other, so it's not about capital returns to shareholders and that's all we've got to do with the money. We think we've struck a really nice balance in terms of appropriate returns to shareholders, sensible capital allocation and investment in the future, whether that be longer-term or shorter-term type initiatives and [ figure in ] the balance sheet. So we still -- our priority, each of those 3, absolutely unashamedly. I'd love to make progress across the balance sheet still for the next 12 months. So we think we've got that balance right. Ultimately, we will work our way around that capital allocation wheel. And if we find ourselves with excess cash as we worked around that wheel, then we will consider how we allocate it back. Right now, I think, the 40% really strikes the right balance."

Okay. On -- we know the guys from hydro pretty well, [ Sid and Richard, the crew ]. They've got a specific set of issues that are quite different to what we have. So I think it's very different, and we do understand the challenges they have. In our case, we've got all of our approvals. The last license approval required is the license to operate, which comes off the installation. So that's pretty clear. Ruben has been working very closely with the prosecutor's office and other officials. I think he counts them as his first, second, and third best friends. And so we know them very well. There was a conversation around some of the requirements on the licensing that the prosecutor put forward, I think a week ago, that was not considered or was knocked back on the basis they don't have jurisdiction. But we engage all of the key players. So we think that the processes we had to go through are pretty straightforward, and we don't anticipate major further disruption, but we'll work through the processes and we are engaged on a daily basis. So we'll wait and see. So far they've been, I think, very supportive. The big thing, we've got 95% of the local community saying we want this. When we had the vote, it was 11 out of 12 of the key representatives of [indiscernible], so they know the community wants this project. And I think that's been very helpful in our condition, in particular, and I think the way the issue was handled has been complemented by literally everyone. Even the prosecutor's office said that you handled it in a very good way. So I think we are maintaining the right dialogue, and I think we're in a good place to keep that going forward.

It's Menno at Morgan Stanley. Just to return to Minas-Rio. I'm a little bit puzzled. The technical review is underway, the results are not in, but remedial construction has started and you hope to be back on the fourth quarter. But how do you know you're back in the fourth quarter if the remedial -- technical review is still underway? So these things seem to clash a little bit. And it's still not clear to me what the indicators are for license #3, because clearly, Ministério Público have said, hmmm, let's remove this. And yes, they don't have jurisdiction, but again can go to the courts and stop the whole process and they've proven to be big defenders of the general good  in the last 18 months after Samarco. So a bit more detail on that, please. Secondly, now that Bruce is here. Clearly, Bruce, you set the -- you let the cat out of the bag, and set the cat amongst the pigeons or whatever the expressions are, but Lightbox seems exciting, but also quite risky. Can you just detail what the thinking behind is? Do you have the Botswana government on board? What's the response in the midstream?

But a Watford forward could. Okay, firstly on the pipeline, we understand -- we believe we understand the key issue with respect to the technical issue: deterioration on a weld. We have tracked a poor batch of pipes. And we know exactly where every one of those pipe is. So the 4 kilometers is based on our understanding and knowledge of what we've seen so far. The most important thing, Menno, is to make sure we confirm that, that is in fact the issue and the only issue. There is a deep technical analysis that the guys took me through over the full 12 hours, and so I'm happy that I think we covered every angle. And as part of the resolution, monitoring the pipe for changed ambient conditions is very important because these things don't fail catastrophically. There may be a fatigue, a small leak over a period of time and it gathers pace. The key thing will be to monitor by temperature, by moisture, by sound and by vibration and we'll have an early indication. We're making sure that those technologies are part of the fix. So that's why it's taking a bit longer, making sure that we understand it and that the fix covers not only the integrity of the pipeline, but also providing early warnings if we have any issues so that we're in full control of the pipeline and making sure it works. Now, the Samarco pipeline ran 6 years without a leak. So we're also understanding those technologies. We've got a few of the Samarco team actually working with us. So we've got experience with us working through those potential issues as well. So again, the right technical expertise right across-the-board is being applied and we're using the advisers to the prosecutor and the government. And I think again, the prosecutors appreciate the fact that we got that type of expertise on the job. Yes, they have in some ways appointed themselves as the protectorate for the community. But having said that, we're in a very constructive dialogue with the guys. And so from our point of view, they will continue to do their job. Our job is to give them comfort that we've got the issues covered. I think we're well down that pathway. It's not there yet. There are still a couple of operating processes we have to go through, and I think the guys are doing everything they should be doing and certainly the feedback has been very positive from all of the key players."

First on the engagement, I'm very comfortable that all of our producer governments are very comfortable with Lightbox. I personally spoke to President Khama before he left, President Masisi, President Ramaphosa and President Geingob, and each of their cabinets. I [ can ] see their cabinet in South Africa and they are all enthusiastic supporters. So a lot of engagement, but I think very good alignment from our producer countries. I think we should remember we launched Lightbox in relation to consumer research, which came back to us, which is consumers in America say they do see that there is a place for a fun fashion accessible product in laboratory grown diamonds. But I don't think they're the same as the natural and I think they don't have any emotional attachment in purchases and they were confused by the current offering. So we didn't do this -- if for any other reason, we did it in response to the consumer demand out there for what they think the product should be. Very important parts of it are color, lots of color in our offering because fashion is color, blue and pink in particular and very important is that the pricing is all binary, so 1 carat costs twice what 0.5 carat costs, and laboratory grown because it takes you twice as long to grow it in a lab. And that's very different than the natural business. The response so far anyway, has been much better than I thought, particularly in the U.S., which is where we aimed this. So all the retailers in the U.S., and we speak to all of them, understand why we're doing it, support it and completely get why we're doing it. We also wanted funders to think twice about funding more production given that the margin seemed to us unsustainable in the current offering and there is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that that's already happening. We probably didn't engage as much as we might have in places like India and Antwerp, but that's not where the current problem is. So we spent much of our engagement in America. I'm very comfortable with where we are there and we will keep engaging around the world as we always do."

I'll just answer the last question on Brazil. As Menno said, I can't help but talk about it. Both Tony and I are fellows of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. So our ability to talk to what we've got is constrained by those requirements and they're appropriate. There is obviously lots of chatter in Brazil. People know that we put a hole through something. We are making sure we understand what that is, but there is a lot of work to be done and we've both been around long enough, 40-odd years. He's been around a bit longer than me. You gotta be careful with this stuff because it may not be what we hope it is. And so in the next 6 months we'll do all the anomaly tests. We'll do additional drilling, I think we'll have something more sensible to say at the end of the year. We should [ rise to ] that. But again I'm also aware of the chatter in Brazil. So it would look rather odd not to say something, given where we are. We prefer to wait 6 months and be clear about what we may or may not have, but it's encouraging. Does that help? But anyway it's encouraging and certainly from our point of view the existence of porphyry in Brazil is something that is certainly a different type of conversation than what we've been told in the past. And certainly, I think it validates the commitment we've made to our exploration teams. So we'll see where that goes, okay."

Firstly on the comfort point, the technical work -- and we are very open to share the technical reports when the work is done. We're very transparent. We'll think that's appropriate. We'll do that with the authorities and we'll do that with anyone that has an interest. From our point of view, we think the evidence is pretty strong, but we want to make sure that we haven't missed anything. So we're working through that process. The 4 kilometers is specific and relates to a batch of pipes that we know were problematic or potentially problematic and we're in the process of understanding the exact failure mechanism. As you can appreciate, we just want to make sure we've got those issues covered. In terms of comfort, it's not an optimistic start. It's what we think is probably the right balance in term in terms of getting the operation up by the end of the year. Clearly, the regulatory approvals, which are normal as part of this sort of process, we expect to be able to navigate those. If there are any other issues that pop out, might take a little bit longer, but at this stage based on all the stuff we have done so far, we're pretty sure we know what the issue is. But again we want to make sure we've got every angle reasonably covered. So we're being prudent, I think, in what we're saying but at the same time, realistic in that there are still a few things to navigate as part of the process. 
In terms of going forward, again, we're a transparent company. We believe in sharing those things that people should be aware of, and we'll do that in an appropriate way. But certainly, the feedback and the support we've had in the community, the fact that we've been there from the first minute, explained every step to the community, the prosecutor and all the key players, I think they've appreciates how open we are. And they have been surprised, I think, how open we are. In fact, I know a couple of competitors are now using Ruben's work on crisis management as an example of how something should be handled. So it's great credit to the Ruben and the team in terms of how they handled a difficult situation at the time. And I think that's helping us in terms of our dialogues with the community.

I think the pipeline inspection gauge technology that there's 3 different sets of gauges being run down, cumulatively they allow us to take cracks down to 1 millimeter. So when we talk about confidence, we talk about being able to detect cracks in the pipes down to a depth of 1 millimeter. We won't -- so the restart is based on replacing 4 kilometers, and to go back to Menno's question, how do we know that 4 kilometers has to be replaced? We don't. We've risk assessed the pipeline. We looked at all contributed factors to the leaks, and based on that assessment we believe if there are any issues those issues will be in the 4 kilometers immediately after the second pump station. So it's anticipatory replacement, but we obviously won't restart till we have all the results back from the pipeline inspection gauge runs. We've analyzed those. We've assessed the condition of the pipelines, but we're anticipating that we won't have to replace pipes, except in that 4 kilometers."

Sylvain Brunet with Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions first on diamonds. First to give us a bit more color behind the softness in sales year-on-year, which were 3% lower in volumes.

Okay. So firstly, on the sales differential, remember last year, we saw a fairly significant clearance of the lower value products, so there was a big inventory clean out. So the sales actually this year have been pretty good, adjusted for that number. So we're very happy with what we have seen so far. Demand in the U.S. looks pretty solid. China has certainly been growing. So we're generally very happy with where the market is, but the difference is really the inventory change that we kicked away early last year. I think that's the main difference."

So very happy with what we've seen from a sales perspective. Certainly, the sentiment's been very solid and we had a recent innovation seminar that we have each year with all our site holders, and they're very positive. And certainly from our point of view, the refusals are very low. That's usually a very good indicator. Secondly, from a Botswana perspective, we never stopped talking to the Botswana government about what we're doing, how we are working together. I think it would be fair to say that we've come on a journey together, and it is a very positive relationship. They've been very supportive of everything we've done. And as you would expect, Bruce and the team are in the appropriate conversations to make sure we get it framed right. But for us, long-term commitments on stripping, they understand that we're there for the long haul. So we'll find the right outcomes. It's getting tighter for us, obviously, and them in terms of value. So it's really about consolidating the relationship and making sure that we're both 110% committed, and I think we're going the right way in those conversations. Bruce do you want to add anything to that? That's fine.
And third on Volcan, firstly, Mr. Agarwal has been a very supportive shareholder. He's made it very clear from everything we've said -- or seen in the press and in his conversation to us that he likes our strategy. He's supportive of what we've been doing as a management team. He has said also that he prefers not to sell any further assets. We haven't been in that process for 2 years. So I think that's a positive. Beyond that you need to ask him, but we're certainly not in any other conversations. The conversations we have with the team with Mr. Agarwal is consistent with the conversation we have with all of our shareholders. And so there is nothing else at play or no other conversations in place. Anything further from their perspective you should ask them, and we're very respectful of that relationship."

It's Alon Olsha from Macquarie. Just 2 questions. Firstly on costs. Inflation hasn't really come up much, which is interesting. One of your other peers, which mainly produces iron ore in Australia has been at pains to emphasize that inflation really is picking up. But from your comments it seems to be fairly benign. So is that your view? Are we kind of experiencing fairly normalized inflation at this point in the cycle? Are there any kind of emerging signs of inflation picking up in certain areas? And then the second question relates to legislation in South Africa, new draft Mining Charter out, a significant improvement on the old charter, or the old draft. Are there still any other issues in that new draft that you want to resolve with government? And then the carbon tax bill in South Africa, where are we on that? And have you guys ever looked at that and the impact it could have on your business?"

Yes, sure. So they're getting sort of too detailed. We average -- CPI across the jurisdictions that we operate in averages at about 3.6% and that's that $200 million that you see on the left-hand side of the graph. We do see a little bit of above-CPI inflation. The way we show that is we net that in our cost and volume benefits, right, because it's our job to sort of drive out above-CPI impacts across the business. And so that's how we disclose it. Are we seeing increases? Yes, I suppose I touched on them, things like diesel, obviously off a $70 oil price. Diesel's up. Shipping fuel's up. So you're seeing some of those things naturally feed through your cost structure. Apart from that, nothing that I would say terribly untoward, remembering that we operate in jurisdictions that have probably higher-than-average sort of inflation impacts, anyway. So for us it's a little bit of business as usual in that that's why we've got to drive those cost and volume improvements. That's why we're so committed to that cost-out journey, because we do see those things coming through, but that was the same the year before and same the year before that. I spoke a little bit at the full year. It's probably a little newer for Australia, particularly in WA and particularly in the Pilbara. They probably had a 5 or 6 year period of deflation, particularly through mining services, where people had spent a lot of capital, there was a lot of capacity there and they were desperately keen just to cover some of their cost to keep the doors open to get through to the next cycle. As those people need to reinvest in the next cycle of capital and capital availability they need returns on that capital. So I think that's what you're starting to see through some of those jurisdictions. Europe has been probably a little bit high, just off the back of better growth, and up until recently maybe the U.S. was starting to [ bubble ] a little bit too. So it's probably in countries where people haven't seen it, it's emerging. For us, I suppose it's a regular part of our business."

They've also got catch-up capital they're spending so they've got a little bit more exposure from a cash point of view as well. Whereas for us, we've been living in those jurisdictions, as Stephen said, so we're little more used to working hard on productivities and all of those things. So it's become more of a way of working and understanding that it's a continuous improvement journey. On the Mining Charter, I think the best way to characterize our conversations and thoughts, the new charter or the new version is certainly, I think, very helpful in providing us with certainty on our existing assets and operations. And that's a big tick, that's a big positive and very pleased for us. So from our perspective very pleased with the certainty that it provides. There is still couple of things that need to be cleaned up, but much happier and certainly gives us the confidence to continue driving and investing in our existing business. In terms of the new parameters, I think there is some real challenges in there in terms of [ freight ] carry, trickle dividend, these other pieces. We've made that very clear. So I think there is a lot of work on both sides of the fence to try and land something that will encourage foreign direct divestment. We've made that point pretty clear, the chambers in those conversations. We're certainly in problem-solving mode with the government. We are optimistic in terms of the long-term in South Africa. We want to be part of that future. So we want to make sure that we have a charter on a go-forward basis that encourages investment, but there is still a bit of work to do on that front. So happy with the key parts in that give us confidence in terms of where we are, but some more work to be done on the look-forward stuff. And I think there is a lot of work still to be done on that front. In terms of the carbon tax, Stephen, you got the numbers so I can give a rough breakdown?"

Myles Allsop UBS. Three quick questions. First just continuing the South Africa conversation. The MPRDA Amendment Bill was pretty toxic and that is still floating around. Does that mean that the uncertainty in South Africa is going to continue for at least 12, 18 months beyond the charter kind of being promulgated? And secondly, just on the M&A side. Obviously, a couple of small acquisitions, just can you give us a sense as to how you as a management team are thinking about M&A going forward? Is it just kind of tacking on small opportunities? Or are you going to get bolder? And then thirdly, the capital allocation, going back to the very first question on dividends. How should we think about when the balance sheet's to the point when there is really excess cash? Are we looking at the wrong net debt number? Should it be the net debt outside of South Africa, was it $7 billion? Has that got to get down to $4 billion before you'll consider lifting the payouts?

So I'll come back -- I'll ask Stephen to get the fine points on his answer regarding the capital. But on the MPRDA, it's been floating around ever since I've been working in South Africa, and that's 10 years in one form or the other. It's complex, you've got the traditional leaders having input, a whole range of players. I still think it's got a long way to go. For me, it doesn't worry me. I think the Mining Charter conversation captures the essence of the nature of the relationship between the 2 parties and that commitment to not jeopardize existing operations and investments, I think, is absolutely critical. I think that's the key sentiment we should hold onto. Because I think the MPRDA's probably still got a fair way to go. And the focus on the charter going forward I think is the other critical element. I think they will then look at harmonizing the 2 and that will take time. So again it's not something I worry about. If you look across the world, the certainty we have in South Africa is certainly pretty robust compared to many jurisdictions, as some of our colleagues are finding in the industry in a range of places around the world. So we can make South Africa better and we're committed to being part of that dialogue. 
On M&A, look, we've always kept our eye on the market as we should. But the good news is, and Stephen picked up 3 points, and I want to reiterate those 3 points. Firstly, our growth going forward will come from internal efficiencies. The efficiencies I talked about on that Mogalakwena slide are available to us in every part of the business and that's the real focus. And Tony and his team, with Seamus with all the operations guys, Bruce and the team, Duncan, everyone, are focused on getting the best of the business and there's still a lot more to be had, so that's the first point. Second point, innovation and step changes. We invested in investment -- or in innovation and technology, because we knew that was the best pathway to growth and effective growth in terms of returns on capital. And we're still committed and Tony and the guys have helped us see a lot more opportunity that provides step opportunities in terms of [ improvement ]. And 3, the internal project pipeline. Quellaveco is the, obviously, the large-scale step, but we've got incremental opportunities across the business. So the first thing we need to do is get the best out of the capital assets we have. That's first, second and third priority. At the same time, we can see opportunities that make sense for us, so [ Peregrin ], the Mototolo conversion and we see some smaller opportunities that make sense and provide us with the ability to continue to improve our performance across the organization. And again, our focus on exploration provides us, we think, with the pathway of very value-accretive growth. So it fits as part of an overall strategy. But we think we're in a better position than most because we've got those internal opportunities. If there is something that's out there that make sense, we will follow it up. We can convert it, we demonstrated we can. But when you got the opportunities we've got, why would you chase stuff that has a higher level of risk. But not saying we won't, but it's got to make sense and it's got to compete with all those great opportunities we got inside the portfolio."

To answer the second part of your question on dividends. Maybe just focus on this half result first of all. So I think generally most numbers that I saw were pretty spot-on in terms of EBITDA. There was a little bit of variance across EPS, given 2 things. One was effective tax rate, it's probably a little bit higher than people were assuming, and that's largely a profit-mix thing. So we had sort of higher profits continuing through Australia and South America with slightly higher effective tax rates in the half. So that's why you saw that the effective tax rate a little bit higher than average. And the other one is depreciation, where people were just a little bit off on, and that's -- we have had new assets commence and we've had increased volumes come through. So the combination of those 2, I think, were the 100 to 200 perhaps that a few people were missing on depreciation. That flowed through to maybe a different expectation on the cents number of earnings -- underlying earnings and therefore dividend. For a couple of really sensible reasons, we are committed to that 40% payout policy. So in the near term, I think that's what you should put in your spreadsheets and that's what you should expect. Ultimately, we will always work our way around that capital allocation wheel and as you get towards the sort of the end of that consideration, one of them is additional returns to shareholders. But as a priority, I would say the balance sheet still outweighs that in terms of just making sure it's absolutely rock solid, as we come into more of an investment phase for the company. So I think it's the absolutely right thing for us to stay focused on. Yes, net debt -- consolidated net debt is one view. I should point out the rest of the world debt, I would like to get that a little bit closer and a little bit more aligned right across the balance sheet. That is part of the reason why we remain focused on de-gearing."

Tyler Broda, RBC Capital Markets. I have 2 questions. Well, 1.5, but question #1a is for diamonds. You're matching the production to the pricing environment. It sounds like things are starting to get bit better in the diamond industry. Venetia is going through the transition. So would you be able to give a guide for where you could get production up to, say over the next 2 years if the market supported it in terms of volumes? And then question 1b is on thermal coal. In terms of the -- looking at the group structures you walked through on those charts on cost curve positioning, the one thing that struck me as interesting, is that thermal coal sort of seems a bit different than a lot of your other assets: shorter mine life, you're getting towards the end of life at a couple of the assets, more weighted to the SA. It's got CSR that's coming up on thermal coal these days. I guess, the question is, is that with the rest of your portfolio having improved as much it has, does thermal coal still fit?"

Okay. In diamonds, we are very sensitive to make sure that we're not running ahead of the market. So we're very happy with what we see and we're supplying to the market, and we have a little bit of flex in terms of what we can do. But as we go through the transition at Venetia and we're making other changes, we don't want to stress that system in the next couple of years. We want to make sure that we're focused on getting our efficiencies right, getting our margins right and not putting more product out there that we might otherwise do better in 2 or 3 years' time in getting that balance right. So Bruce and the guys are watching that very carefully. If they had to kick up a million carats, I think we've got the capacity, depending upon where we are and what we're doing. Longer term we hit closer to the 37 million carats towards the 4- and 5-year period. But again that's based on the transition that we go through for Venetia and making sure that we're getting the best out of the other assets. So we got the potential there, but at the same time, we're trying to match that to the market so that we keep the margins in a healthy place. Bruce, do you want to say anything? On thermal coal, Seamus did a very good speech a few weeks back to the staff, and if I can borrow on how he presented the story, which I think is exactly the right way to present it, we've got very good assets in thermal coal, very good cost positions. We're low quartile or right on the cusp, and we can improve with our productivity. There has been a very significant, what about 40%, 50% productivity improvement in South African the last about 3, 3.5 years. We've got 14 years life on average. And from our point of view, it makes sense to continue to run those quality assets through that process and we're making sensible capital allocations on incremental life extensions. It would certainly be a lot harder for us to justify a big investment in thermal coal that goes beyond the 7-year lifetime on the basis that there are questions about the value that you will see in thermal coal relative to oil, gas and the whole fossil fuel question. So we think committing our capital to Quellaveco and other incremental projects makes sense, but we won't starve the business of capital and we make sensible decisions. When we talk about the transition, we've halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 5 years and we call it a just transition. We're connecting with our communities. We're making sure they understand what we're doing in those local communities. The governments and the customers that we work for understand exactly how we're going, and we're making incremental investments. But it will be a lot tougher for us to justify a big investment for a long term development position in thermal coal, given the uncertainties in the price environment. So it would have to be a very special case. So carefully considered, measured as we go and we will keep the market and everyone else informed, because the CSR conversation is a very important one to us and one that we are very cognizant of. But at the same time, we're not going to bail out tomorrow and many of the CSR stakeholders are very appreciative of the fact that we haven't run, that we have been clear about the transition, and they said, we prefer that because we understand the importance of your local communities. We understand the importance of those industries to the big power stations, and it's better to have a responsible operator like you transitioning with those assets than having some other characters running those assets in a way that may not be as sensitive as the way you guys will run it. So we're trying to get the balance right."

And then just pick up some details on the foundations that we have created and why we believe we've set ourselves up for the next 5 years. It'll look quite different to where we've been. Most importantly though, I think, talking about the lessons we've learned over the last 5 years and how those lessons are being applied into how we think about and how we'll execute the continuing improvement journey that we're focused on over the next 5 years.
And with that, we'll kick straight into performance. From an operating performance point of view, continuing improvement in the operations performance. Our $400 million improvement in the first half reflects that -- half of that $800 million commitment for the full year. Again, Stephen will unpack those numbers just to help you understand where we've got that from.
Earnings and cash flow reflect continuing improvement in the business. Our EBITDA is up 11%. Attributable free cash flow, when you pull apart the one-offs compared to last year is pretty solid, but we need to continue to improve. 
On margins and returns, we've improved our EBITDA margin to 41%, and our return on capital employed is 19%. So it's a solid set of results, more we can do. And certainly, we're focused on continuing the trends to improve and make sure we've got the business that can deliver consistently.
On safety, health and environment, important place for us to start. Unfortunately, we've reported 2 fatalities in the first half and, in fact, we had a third fatal incident in July. So still a lot of work to be done. We have improved. But from my point of view, these aren't a good set of results until we're at 0. And so that quest continues. The elimination of fatalities task force work is starting to get a real momentum. So I think we're in the middle of impacting that performance and, certainly, a 31% improvement in the total frequency rate for the half is encouraging, but nowhere near where we want to be. So encouragement, but a lot more work to be done. 
Health, the numbers are good. We continue to focus on a broad range of issues with our work force. 
On the environmental side, again a solid set of results, but I would say, the disappointment, obviously, Minas-Rio. Of the 4 incidents that we reported in the first half, the Minas-Rio leaks with 2 of those incidents. Lot of work going on now. As we stand today, we are in the middle of the process of inspecting the pipe. We are setting up to replace around 4 kilometers of pipe. So that's been ordered. It's all being done. The preparation work is being done. We're working with the authorities to make sure that we've got appropriate independent advice and that we're connecting to the authorities so that the appropriate regulatory approvals move through fairly quickly. So we're still on track to start producing again by the end of the year, but there is still a fair bit of work to be done and to make sure that we fully understand the mechanism. We believe we do, but I want to wait till all of the inspections are done to make sure we've got every angle covered. So a lot of work going on, and, again, both Seamus and Ruben are here, if you'd like to understand a little bit more. After our sessions, you're more than welcome to chat to the guys.
On productivity and improvement, generally, through the operations, as you know, productivity continues to improve. For us, volumes are up 8% over the last 5 years, and the key number, obviously, number of assets. So when we either took fairly drastic action in either closing or selling assets, we pulled out about 15% to 17% of our productive capacity. So the fact that we're up 8% reflects improved performance from the existing assets. And on average, it's about 30% uplift in performance across the existing asset or the current asset suite. We've also had a couple of contributions from assets coming into the mix, Grosvenor, for example, but they're still not yet at full capacity. So our productivity should continue to improve over the course of the next 18 months. And for us, that's very important because we want to continue to improve our operating costs and our competitive positions.
On numbers, in terms of people, there has been a significant reduction. We've gone from around 160,000 down to 95,000. We will continue to tighten the cost structure up within the business, so those numbers will continue to reduce, but we're making sure that we do that with all of our employees. But that's where the focus is to continue to improve our cost position.
I just wanted to give a little bit of sense or to give you a little sense of what does an average 30% improvement look like across the business. So this slide is a slide around Mogalakwena. It could easily be Sishen. It could be Moranbah. It could be Grasstree. It could be Kolomela. It could be Los Bronces, you get the picture. 
So at Mogalakwena, on mining, our shovel productivities have gone from 1,700 to 2,300. There is still a long way to improve. The last 5 years, we're up 5% -- 34%, sorry, and we still see significant performance potential in the assets, but that's been encouraging in terms of the underlying mixed shovel productivities across the group.
On truck utilization, we're up 20%, almost 20%. It's actually at 20%, now. We've gone from 5,400 hours per truck to 6,500 hours per truck. So it also helps explain why our sustaining capital numbers have been improving as well. So we're getting more out of the assets we have. 
In terms of the concentrators and tonnes processed, we're up 35%. And so, whilst we've improved the north concentrator and the south concentrator, we did add some incremental volumes with BAOBAB, but overall the underlying efficiency improvements in our operations is north of 20%. Again that's very important and not $1 of capital is being spent on any of those improvements.
At the same time, we've gone from 74% recovery of payable material to 80% recovery. So the volumes are up. And without putting new storage or other capacity in, we've been able to improve our underlying recoveries by 8%. So that's straight to the bottom line. So that's been significant. So we're improving both the volumes and the quality of the work that's being done. As a consequence of that improvement and with the way we set the pit up, and if you can recall 3, 4 years ago, we talked about rescheduling the pit, over the next 15 years, we've got some improvements in grade. And when you add all of that up together, we've seen a 60% increase in production of precious metals.
So we're now at or around 1 million ounces of precious metals. We talk about platinum, but for us, it's about all the payables and that's north of 1 million ounces payable. Today, our margin is 45%, even though the platinum price has dropped 30%, that's been significant. And the real story, and this all adds up to -- and this is equivalent platinum cost, we've gone from $994 back in 2012 to $250 an ounce. So Chris' target of 0 platinum cost is alive and well. There is still a lot of potential, and we think we can get there. Obviously, grade will play some part in that. But from our point of view, 75% reduction, or if you want to talk margins, we've gone from a 40% margin to a 45% margin, despite a 30% reduction in the price of the products we produce. And that's really a big part of the story in terms of getting platinum from net $1.5 billion debt to a net cash position at the half year. So in a pretty strong place and so very pleased with that. And again that's a number of assets that I could talk to in those same terms so Sishen, Kolomela, a full portfolio.
Importantly, it's improving our competitive position across our commodities. So in 2013 -- the best data we had for the business is 2014. But if you look at the positions across the quartile cost curves, these are the positions by commodity that we occupied back in 2013, '14. So as a consequence of portfolio, operating efficiencies and some of the new innovation stuff that we're starting to tinker with and introduce into the operation, which will become a much bigger part of the story in the next 5 years, we've started to see improvements in our relative position. So this means we're moving quicker in those areas where you're seeing we're going to the right in terms of cost positions relative to competitors. So copper has gone from 71% to the 57 percentile. Quellaveco, being Q1, will take us mid-Q2. So again, a very important addition to the portfolio in terms of the quality of the copper business.
Met coal, Moranbah, in particular, Grosvenor will still -- will start to make a significant contribution, and Grass Tree have taken us to the top of the league table in terms of longwall operations moving us again to the left. So Seamus [ in the mid-term ] has done a great job in the Met Coal business. In De Beers, general focus on cost, Gahcho Kué is making a good contribution. So again moving to the left with more to be done. 
In platinum, you know the Mogalakwena story, but we are improving other assets, including Amandelbult. A lot more to be done in those assets and a lot more potential still at Mogalakwena, but a good shift to the left. In nickel, Barro Alto got the furnaces sorted out. From what we can judge in the Nickel business, Barro Alto now is the -- one of the very few major new nickel assets that are actually -- hit the design capacity. And if you remember the problems we had with the furnaces, we redid the furnaces and now are at full rate. And again, Ruben has been the leader of the business for some years now and is probably the best in control asset that we've got across the group. And we've got a lots of success stories, but in terms of nickel, those furnaces are really starting to set the trend and the benchmark for us as a business to follow in terms of running an asset well.
In thermal coal, story not as positive. We pulled up capital in Cerrejón with our partners on the basis that we didn't think it was the right time or we weren't spending that capital as well as we could. So we pulled a bit to the right. We've also got 2 assets getting close to end of life. So that's impacted the costs. Over the next 3 to 4 years, [ rate ] will start to come out of the system. So we'll move again to the left, but there is more work to be done on productivity and Seamus can talk about some of the things he is working on at the moment in thermal coal, in particular, in South Africa.
In iron ore, you guys know the story pretty well, a lot of new capacity in the Pilbara and in Brazil has been built. So the curve's shunted to the right. In our case, we've more than halved our controllable cost at Kumba. But even with that, we've not been able to complete at this level, but we've closed the gap to the Pilbara and Brazil. And in fact, I think 3 of the months last year towards the end of the year, where premium -- quality premiums and lump premiums were pretty good. We're actually middle Q2. So for us, the target is $10 a tonne either through premiums and cost, that would give us a 35 breakeven landed in China, gets us in this range. So Seamus and the guys and Themba know what has to be done in the next 3 to 5 years, that's -- we're in pursuit of trying to get ourselves on the bottom half of the cost curve.
Minas-Rio at full rate is mid-Q2 as well by strong quality and cost around 35 landed in China. So there is work to be done. We know what we've got to do, but there is still more to be done to get ourselves to the left-hand side of the cost curve. So today 2018, we've moved from 52 percentile to 46 percentile. We have a view on how we've done against our competitors. We've done well, we think, but it's a constant analysis from our point of view because we've got to keep driving ourselves to the left. So in each of those businesses, we know what we've got to do to get ourselves to the left. We've got to try and get there quicker than our competitors, and that's the imperative, that's the focus and that's what I'll talk about when I talk about things a little bit later in terms of the 5 years. So today, if you remember, we were predominantly here. We've moved a lot of the businesses into the second quartile, but we've still got more work to do. And certainly, we know how to get there in copper, and Seamus and the guys are very focused on getting us there in iron ore as well.
As a consequence, from 2012, we're up to 41% margin. That is against a lower price deck for our commodities. So our 23% reduction in cost, which is the nominal number or about 30% real has helped us move up the margin curve. And we know and -- that includes, sorry, I should say, also includes the marketing work that Peter and the team have been doing, so that's been important in terms of our margins. 
Over the next 5 years -- 3 to 5 years, we'll continue with the efficiency work. Our innovation and technology work is set to make a more significant contribution in the 3- to 5-year range. And again, Tony can describe some of the things that we've got going. And with -- obviously, with Quellaveco and the smaller projects that we're starting to put onto the launching pad, there is a real push to head us towards the 50% type margin, clearly, subject to price. But on an apples-to-apples basis, we know where we've got to go and what we're driving towards.
So with that, I'll hand across to Steve. He will unpack the number."

So it's a really good set of numbers. It's a clean set of numbers. Importantly, it sort of simply shows where we're focusing our efforts as we run the business and as we prioritize the themes that we want to do internally. And those priorities really continue around a balanced approach. So it's a balanced approach around returns to shareholders, capital allocation and ongoing focus on the balance sheet. And the same themes that you saw in the last 6 months prior, you're seeing in these 6 months and you'll see again in the next 6 months. The journey continues. We'll also unpack a little bit about the EBITDA drivers and will finish on the report card that we talked to.
So we speak a lot about our focus on cost and volume. And the reason we do that is because we know from time to time at different parts of the cycle, we will come under pressure from inflation and other sort of cost increases. This half, we delivered $400 million of the $800 million target that we set for this year, and that $400 million takes us to $4.6 billion since 2012.
What are we've seen in terms of some of those cost increases, and we touched on this theme a little bit at the full year results, so increased diesel price given the higher oil price, but that's the same for everyone really across the industry. We're seeing increased energy prices, particularly Schiedam in South Africa, and that can reflect itself either in electricity prices or in infrastructure charges if those things also use energy. And we've also seen a little bit of wages and salary growth again South Africa, South America, in particular. But that's the reason why we stay focused on these cost and volume improvements, so we stay ahead of the curve. So let's have a quick talk at this slide. So we'll move across left to right. So in terms of prices, PGM is up, largely driven by palladium and rhodium.
Copper, thermal coal: also up. In terms of currency, a little bit of a mixed bag. In terms of currencies, probably the most noticeable one was the strengthening of the ZAR through the half, so the South African Rand through the half, and that softened right towards the end of June 30. 
Inflation, I've touched on. Minas-Rio, we'll highlight separately for you through the year, so that you can just clearly understand the impact that has first and second half. The good news is, we are on track in terms of the inspection and repair work. Garden is unchanged in terms of coming on at the end of the fourth quarter. And really, as we look forward to '19, a little bit of positive momentum into earnings as that comes back on stream.
I just want to step away for a moment from this half's numbers and just look a little bit forward as we look at that sort of cost and volume improvement journey that's ahead of us. So you recall, at the full year, we outlined our target over the next 5 years from the start of '18 to the end of '22, $3 billion to $4 billion improvement that we're looking for. And there is really 3 broad buckets. So I just want to give you a touch of a little more detail to help you understand where the focus is.
So the first bucket is operational efficiency. You'll hear us talk internally and probably a little more externally about [ P 101 ], and it's sort of the catchphrase that we have internally that really talks about getting to benchmark and beyond. So full potential plus is sort of another phrase of how we explain it. And even though we've had a great journey in some of the assets, and Mark spoke about Mogalakwena before, there is still a real opportunity in front of us. And we've improved Mogalakwena. We've improved Sishen. We've improved cutting rights and things from Moranbah-Grosvenor, but we still have real opportunity in front of us to get to benchmark and beyond and really sort of set the trend for the industry. And that's across all the diggers, all the trucks, processing plant, recovery, it's everywhere. We've got that same mentality as we look for those improvement opportunities.
When you do start to approach [ P 101 ], you've got to start to make some choices. How do you take that benefit? Do you take that benefit in terms of cost out? Do you park up trucks? Do you park up diggers? Do you take that benefit in terms of increased production, if you can get it to market down infrastructure? Or is it some combination of both? Is it a focus on grade and quality of product, so that you're maximizing your margin of what you earn for each tonne? So they're the sort of choices that we have to make as we go forward, great choices and great opportunities to have to think through. It's a really, really great challenge as we look and think about the business all the way from mine to market and think about how we maximize that value equation.
Second bucket is around technology and innovation. And here I suppose I want to give you a sense that we're moving out of the lab and into the field, right? So we really have a quite a neat schedule as we roll out some of these production test units across some of our operations. So in the concentrated mine it's about bulk sorting. What is that? It's about more precisely getting the cut-off grade right by separating, prior to the main processing plant, the lower grade element of what we're about to put through the plant. So the aim there is a 10% to 20% increase in feed grade through the processing plant. We're about to put the first of those units into El Soldado, should be in about end of August, September timing. I think that's Jwaneng. And then early next year, it'll be at Barro Alto and Mogalakwena. So those things really starting to go live and roll out across the operations.
In copper, we're probably more certain of the benefit. Platinum, still doing some early phase work to make sure that we're going to get those sorts of benefits. On coarse particle flotation, so remember that's sort of coarser grinding, so that we get -- we use less energy. So the target there is 30% more throughput, a smaller recovery loss, maybe 3%, and that should get us 20% less energy, 30% less water. Again, copper will be the first rollout of that at El Soldado and that will really be through the early half of 2019.
The third bucket's really about project delivery, and Mark's touched on some of those themes. We've spoken about them before, Moranbah-Grosvenor and debottlenecking, potentially an extra vessel in Debmarine, Quellaveco coming in at the end of '22. So lots of opportunities in front of us. Again, the commitment across the whole organization to chase these things, really quite exciting for us at the moment, the momentum and enthusiasm that we've got across all of the operations.
Okay, so back to some of today's results. The main message here is really about stability of earnings and effectiveness of capital allocation. So from a stability of earnings point of view, 3% increase in EPS, 6% increase in return-on-capital employed to 19%.
Looking at cash flow. So we did have a really strong 2017. So we did have a number of sort of one-offs benefits that flowed through 2017, which you are now seeing a more normalized level of sort of cash flow on a half-to-half basis. So last time around some of the one-offs, we had slightly lower cash tax. We just restarted the dividend post the half year. So we had less minority leakage. We had lower CapEx. We had a bit of working capital release in the first half of last year. So a more normalized state this time around. If you normalize for those things, you have a good increase period-on-period, strong cash flow for the half.
Turning to the balance sheet. Focus on net debt reductions continued, a further $0.5 billion down to $4 billion. It remains a priority for us, as I said earlier, and we are determined still to take advantage of this window of opportunity that we have before we have to put our hand in our pocket to -- for CapEx on Quellaveco.
At $4 billion, we're probably really at the low end of -- we're very, very comfortable with where the debts hits for this part of the cycle. So remember, I spoke last time around about the way I look at the balance sheet across 3 key metrics. So absolute net debt level, obviously, strength of the balance sheet. Net debt-to-EBITDA strength of the underlying cash flow, although that can obviously move with volatility and commodity prices and, obviously, net gearing or net leverage ratios really goes to the heart of the strength of the balance sheet even through those cycles. We will remain focused on all 3. Our guidance for the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at 1 to 1.5x. We don't want to exceed that for any long period through the lows of the cycle. Obviously, we're at incredibly attractive levels as we should be for this part of the cycle. Ideally, we want to set this balance sheet up so that we can be counter-cyclical if opportunities emerge in the years ahead.
So in terms of returns to shareholders, we're committed to the payout policy, 40% of underlying earnings per share, $0.49 for the period, slightly nudged up from where we were in the prior half. So with this dividend that takes our returns to shareholders to $1.9 billion since we restarted the dividend this time last year. That's about a 4% yield. Just to tick over, I think, on today's prices. So just to wrap it up, then how did we go in terms of report card? So prior to discretionary capital, $1.8 billion of cash flow. What did we do with it? Net debt down $0.5 billion, final dividend $700 billion in terms of -- $700 million in terms of returns to shareholders and a few other bits and pieces. Discretionary capital $200 million for the half. Obviously, that will tick up a little bit through the second half of 2019. So as I say, continued journey, continued trends, a good journey that we're on. Mark, back to you."
409115,574439891,1515709,"Anglo American plc, H1 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

People ask me about the ship in terms of capital discipline. When I look at Bruce, if I could just make a simple point, one of those incremental improvements that we've got available to us is to build and put on the water a new ship, represents a 1 year payback. That's what we're about. Efficiency of capital, getting good returns. And that typifies or exemplifies our perfect project [ 12-1 payback ].
For us, when we look at the business, we talk about the commodity positions, I'd like to stress the point that the positions we have by commodity are a function of our focus on quality assets. It's our focus on quality assets that determines where we put our capital and where we develop. The good news for us in copper, the fundamentals are strong. We've got a great position, and we're able to convert that opportunity and something very real with Quellaveco. And many are pursuing copper in the industry, we've got some great internal options both from a greenfields perspective, a brownfields perspective. And longer term, we think our exploration work will position us even further in terms of the industry, so a great position to be in.
In terms of -- I'm sorry, I should go back, just finish the story. In terms of diamonds, we continue to supply to demand. And as we see demand growing, we've got the ability to flex. We are transitioning in a couple parts of the business. Obviously, Venetia going from open cut to underground. So that's a transition story at the moment. Gahcho Kué hitting [ and strapped ], certainly, continuing improvements. Obviously, Debmarine and Jwaneng, important contributors in terms of the business. And certainly, the prognosis looks pretty good going forward, certainly very encouraging. 
On PGM, big focus on Mogalakwena and its ability to make continuing improvements and a major or a significantly improved contribution. But in particular, for us right at the moment, a lot more work to be done at Amandelbult. And so still continuing our journey down the cost curve. A lot   of work to be done. Very focused, Chris and his team are very focused there. And clearly, the big contribution from bulks. If you look at the numbers from bulks over the last couple of years, they've been exceptional. Moranbah, the Grosvenor ramp-up continues. So from our point of view, lots of incremental opportunities in that business to improve that contribution and, certainly, the contribution in the last 2 years has been significant and will continue to be strong, given the improving performance across the business.
For us, the potential or the focus on portfolio upgrading has continued. Obviously, we'll talk about Quellaveco in a couple of minutes. PGM's union mine, we've completed the sale. BRPM sale continues our focus on really focusing on those assets that can move the dial for us. The Mototolo acquisition should be really thought about -- firstly, we know the asset, we know the resource. The purchase position with Glencore is about extending from the 5-year life to a 30-year life, with a connection to Der Brochen. That doesn't mean we're going to go out and do anything significant today. What it does do is provide us a long-term option in terms of the business. It's not the right time in the market to go and spend something new in terms of the asset, but positioning ourselves very important in terms of quality assets for the long term, and we see this as a good move. 
Thermal coal, you're aware of the completion of the transactions on the tied mines along with New Largo. And in De Beers, we haven't been standing with our feet in the mud. Lightbox, a very important step in terms of the business and, again, Bruce is here, if you'd like a bit more insight into that, happy to answer any questions. And obviously, the offer for Peregrine flags an approach for us that's very important. The world is short of diamonds. There will be significant shortfall by 2022. So we're positioning ourselves with options in terms of going into the market. But again, it's market-led, making sure that we're doing the right things and spending our money in a smart way.
Quellaveco, some have observed that the photo does indicate that we have been active in the last 2 or 3 years. The actual number, Jason, is about $500 million in terms of investment in value in the ground, in keeping the option open. But I think it's been money well invested in terms of understanding the geotechnical issues, understanding the big issues that you don't know about before you make those big commitments and most importantly, it's been an investment in the community and the commitments that we made to the community. So in terms of those relationships, absolutely critical in a place like Peru, and we certainly got the support of the local committee. So it's been an important part of the work.
On Quellaveco itself, obviously, returns, key focus for us, making sure that we get the discipline right. Internal rate of return works off the midpoint of the range that we talked about in terms of the capital, the $5 billion to $5.3 billion. Return on capital employed is north of 20% when we hit that full production rate and through the first 10 years, and our payback post first production is 4 years, so for us very important metrics. And if you look at the key hurdles that we set ourselves in terms of our capital allocation processes 4 years ago, it ticks each one of those boxes.
In terms of the asset itself, low cost. And I'll unpack why the costs are as low as they are. Long life, obviously, the resource is significant. We do see significant long-term potential beyond the 30 years. And I think the address in terms of who is next to us tells you there is a good story or good potential story there in the long term. 
Capital discipline, the commitment to the syndication and the partnership with Mitsubishi was very important. And as Stephen indicated, we won't be required to put our hand in our pocket in funding our share until well into 2019. So that's an important point to make in terms of the balance sheet and our continuing journey in reducing our debt.
In terms of being execution-ready, it's permitted. The social credentials is where we had been investing and working very hard with the local community, they're very strong. And from the dialogue tabled in 2012, it's been a real success story in terms of the conversations. Interestingly, the Governor, [ the Chair, ] the round table in 2012 is now the President of the country. And so I think he is probably more excited than we are in terms of the commitment, and we'll be standing with him next week, talking about that in the context of Peru. So very strong support from the government right the way through the local community, which is something that's very important in all of our jurisdictions and particularly Peru.
Again, execution-ready. In terms of the community support, we've actually committed through the life of the project, $300 million in community investment programs. And it's not the investment programs that we think they should have. They are the investment programs that they've asked us to help them with in being a true partner in the community. And it is different -- it's a different approach, it's a different conversation, and we think critical to ensure continuity and cost competitiveness of the project you need your local community in there as a partner.
Our key permits are in place. The construction program is as good as I have seen in my 42 years in the industry. Clearly, we've had a long time to bake this cake and we've done a lot of the pre-work and we've applied all the lessons that we could, plus some, out of our previous adventures, or misadventures in some cases. So I think it's well set up and we're well set up for success. Tom's here to lead the project, but Duncan, Tony, all of the GMC members have been active participants in making sure that we've looked at this from every angle.
The syndication, I think, was an important message to everyone that we are serious about thinking about a different investment model for the industry. Yes, it borrows somewhat from the oil and gas sector in terms of sharing that risk. We've got a good partnership with Mitsubishi. We know them well, they know us well, and certainly from our point of view, we think it's a win-win for both of us as an organization. And when I talk about returns, the fact that we've been able to book a profit on some of the investments we have made has actually helped us return a little bit better IRR return than we're reporting at the project level. So the good news is it actually enhances our returns as well, and we think that's smart to do, in putting a little bit of that profit back in our pocket and using that to help fund the early parts of the progress and keep our balance sheet in good shape and able to support the continuing improvements across other parts of the portfolio. So again we think it's a win-win for us and for all parts of our business.
The returns, very important. You've seen the headline numbers I've talked about. I think the EBITDA margin -- we talked about that 50% target for us as a group. This helps us achieve that type of improvement in our margins. The construction capital, and this is our share post-syndication, in the range $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. I think it's important to focus on as well as in terms of Anglo American's financial commitment to building the project. And from our point of view, in 2018, our share will be around $400 million, so it will be fully funded from the proceeds that we received from Mitsubishi and that goes well into '19 as well.
Unit operating cost for the first 10 years, $1.05. In fact with the softer material in the first 5 years, it's a bit below that. The structural cost advantages are important for people to understand. It's low-strip ratio, below one. Secondly, for the first 10 years most of the haul is downhill. So you've got low-cost haulage costs and the labor cost and the energy cost are very competitive. They are not a pittance as some would be in other parts of the world. In Peru, it's a developed country. It's a progressive country, the productivities are good, the pays are good, but more competitive than some of the other jurisdictions. So from our point of view the structural cost base is very good. Hydropower is also an advantage in terms of the energy. So it's a good mix and we're making a good contribution in terms of the organization. And it's also sustainable because the pay rates are very competitive on a broader basis. Production 300,000 tonne a year for the first 10 years. It'll be a bit higher than that the first 5, again as a consequence of the softer material going through the plant very quickly. 
Cost position, as we said, we will improve our cost position as a consequence of Quellaveco. It will move us solidly into Q2. If you remember the copper position on the top curve. So that's an important step for us, again a continuing focus on improving the portfolio.
Can you give us a kick on the slide? Thank you. The start of the resource unit, I think the big thing with copper deposits, we're in a great address. So the 2 southern copper assets that flank us have been long-term assets, very successful assets. And certainly from our point of view, the address is a great address. The mineralization is pretty well known. And from our point of view, it's open to depth, certainly in one direction. So we would expect beyond the 40 years from the project, and if you look at the resource base, obviously, significant. We would like to think it's beyond 60 years, a lot of work to be done, obviously, to prove those sorts of numbers, but significant potential. If you look at history in terms of Los Bronces growth since 2004, same with Collahuasi, we think it's one of those types of deposits that becomes a long-term foundation for the group. And so a very important commitment and I think well priced, great returns and for the long-term is a changing -- or is a portfolio changer for us as a group.
So on the foundations that we've set or have been setting and with Quellaveco being another step toward building on those foundations, I think it's important to just reflect for a moment that today if you looked at where we were 5 years ago, our average life of mine was somewhere between 20 and 25 years. Today, we are at 30 years across the portfolio. Our thermal coal assets have got the shortest life of about 14 years and some assets have got beyond 100, [ i.e. ] the Mogalakwena. Our target is, in the next 5 years is to make sure we maintain that life as a minimum. There are opportunities to increase the life, which will then ultimately underpin future growth in the asset base, again connected to the markets. But with that type of asset base, we're in a unique position and certainly, unique in our industry and it gives us the ability to focus on that underlying improvement for the long term. So every time we make an improvement, we've got 30 years to bank the results, and that's critical and that is different in our industry to many of our competitors. 
So we've also got a list of opportunities in each of those commodity positions that provide us with the opportunity to grow, and we're forecasting as Stephen talked about, a 3% growth year-on-year through to 2022. And we have the options that go well beyond that type of configuration or that time frame. So Sakatti for example, is something that could follow a Quellaveco, market conditions permitting. But it's a smaller asset, low capital base, high margins, great returns. So we've got a number of those types of opportunities across the portfolio. 
Something that we'll start to talk about in the next year or 2 is exploration. Through the tough times in '15 and '16, we didn't stop committing to exploration and technical innovation. And I think today, we're starting to see the benefits of that commitment in terms of what we're doing on the ground. So in terms of our exploration strategy, Tony and the team redefined our approach to exploration, a step back, big regional positions, think about exploration in a very different way. And so we're focused on key geographies. The innovation work that we're doing now is being applied to our approach to exploration. And for us, it's all about value. And certainly from our point of view, we think the exploration team is starting to show real value for the commitment that we've shown in the last 2 or 3 years, in particular. And today, we've got some really interesting positions. For those that have been tracking us, you're probably aware that we drilled some holes in Brazil, 6 holes. We've stopped. We've actually pegged out fairly substantial land position. I think it's 5x the size of Kent, or in Australia, it's about the size of [ Gina's ] backyard. 
It is a significant position. And certainly, from our point of view, it's a very interesting place to be. We think we may be sitting on a porphyry, but there is a lot of work still to be done. Early days, but we'll keep you posted in terms of the process over next 6 to 18 months. And our brownfields opportunities, we've been doing a lot of drilling around Mogalakwena, Los Bronces both from an underground potential and extensions to the existing operation and obviously the Quellaveco district. So we're not going to do much more than let you know that this is becoming a very important part of our portfolio and the future options that we have. 
Again, focus on asset quality as a consequence, revenue by product, quite a mixed bag. So that from our point of view, it really is different, and we're providing different set of options to the marketplace. And in our case, the quality of the assets that underpin those revenue streams are very strong. So from our perspective, we think it's differentiated, it's unique. Capital employed by geography over time has been balancing pretty well, South Africa at 26%, used to be up near 50%. We are getting the balance right, certainly from our point of view, we think the risk profile in terms of the revenue base is starting to balance out quite nicely. And that will continue to balance out over the next 3 to 5 years with the commitment to Quellaveco, certainly improving that balance across key geographies. 
I just turned the thing off, that wasn't helpful. In terms of are we positioned in commodities for the future. We're well positioned in electrification and innovation. A greener world, PGMs, in particular, copper is part of that world. In terms of coking coal, the quality of our coking coal and the quality of our iron ore is playing very much into the China environmental story. We think the premiums on those products will certainly remain as China and other locations focus on quality and making sure that it's both efficiency and clean production from those sources. So we think that's important. And growing middle-class, platinum jewelry, diamonds, those other products, are all playing into those sectors. So again there as a consequence of our differentiation across the portfolio, we're playing into the right market segments in terms of use of raw materials and products. 
And finally, for us, again, it's about assets. We're building the capabilities inside the organization to take advantage of the quality we have inside the asset base. And for us, it's about cash flow, it's about the efficiency of those cash flows as measured in return on capital and it's about being sustainable from safety all the way through to the social contract we have with the partners in developing new opportunities in the business, absolutely critical. And that's the Anglo American story. So I'm very happy to take questions."

Whilst obviously positive that you've restarted dividend, maybe the range maybe looks a little bit skinny relative to some of your peers. Can you just comment on why given the strength of balance sheet you don't adopt maybe greater flexibility and a higher payout ratio going forward? And then finally, on cost control. Copper looked like the one area that stood out as having a reduction in unit costs during the period. Some of that seems to be grade related. Could you just maybe give us some guidance in how should we think about copper unit costs second half of this year and also 2019 and maybe some more detailed guidance on grades."

Yes. I mean just a way into the cost story. So yes, it was a great half for copper. Currency and a bit of inflation went against us, but going with us was obviously both the volume increase, grade as you said, and some byproduct credits also sort of played into that. So a good outcome and Duncan has assured me he is going to keep delivering for the second half so that, again, I'd expect us to come inside our previous guidance. Generally, across the other commodities, I suppose the same part of that last theme. So mixed impacts in terms of currency and volumes, grade, et cetera, but generally we're inside and tracking inside of our full year guidance for most of the commodities. Coming to your other topics. So Quellaveco CapEx. So we are guiding that we will spend $400 million on a 100% basis for the balance of this -- $300 million to $400 million for the balance of this calendar year. That will be funded from the proceeds, from the sell down. Some of those proceeds will then carry on through into next year. And so on the first phase, largely through that first half, will also be funded from those proceeds, and it's really then, let's call it mid-next year that will start to contribute on a 60-40 basis. So if you recall in the announcement of the sell down, it's about $833 million comes in and that's the $500 plus gross-up comes into the account. So it's the 834th millionth dollar that then gets funded on the 60-40 basis, if that's the correct [ THs ] and all those sorts of things. We're not guiding at the moment in terms of the exact split. When we come out with capital guidance for '19, we will give you a better split and those sort of things, but it is a fairly typical sort of project spend profile. So years sort of '19 -- years '20, '21 will probably be the largest spends and then it will ease back in '22 as we get to the end. In terms of dividend policy, listen, we were really happy with the 40% sort of guidance and payout ratio when we struck it, and we still think it strikes the right balance. Now remember for us, it's not about one thing or the other, so it's not about capital returns to shareholders and that's all we've got to do with the money. We think we've struck a really nice balance in terms of appropriate returns to shareholders, sensible capital allocation and investment in the future, whether that be longer-term or shorter-term type initiatives and [ figure in ] the balance sheet. So we still -- our priority, each of those 3, absolutely unashamedly. I'd love to make progress across the balance sheet still for the next 12 months. So we think we've got that balance right. Ultimately, we will work our way around that capital allocation wheel. And if we find ourselves with excess cash as we worked around that wheel, then we will consider how we allocate it back. Right now, I think, the 40% really strikes the right balance."

But we engage all of the key players. So we think that the processes we had to go through are pretty straightforward, and we don't anticipate major further disruption, but we'll work through the processes and we are engaged on a daily basis. So we'll wait and see. So far they've been, I think, very supportive. The big thing, we've got 95% of the local community saying we want this.

But a Watford forward could. Okay, firstly on the pipeline, we understand -- we believe we understand the key issue with respect to the technical issue: deterioration on a weld. We have tracked a poor batch of pipes. And we know exactly where every one of those pipe is. So the 4 kilometers is based on our understanding and knowledge of what we've seen so far. The most important thing, Menno, is to make sure we confirm that, that is in fact the issue and the only issue. There is a deep technical analysis that the guys took me through over the full 12 hours, and so I'm happy that I think we covered every angle. And as part of the resolution, monitoring the pipe for changed ambient conditions is very important because these things don't fail catastrophically. There may be a fatigue, a small leak over a period of time and it gathers pace. The key thing will be to monitor by temperature, by moisture, by sound and by vibration and we'll have an early indication. We're making sure that those technologies are part of the fix. So that's why it's taking a bit longer, making sure that we understand it and that the fix covers not only the integrity of the pipeline, but also providing early warnings if we have any issues so that we're in full control of the pipeline and making sure it works. Now, the Samarco pipeline ran 6 years without a leak. So we're also understanding those technologies. We've got a few of the Samarco team actually working with us. So we've got experience with us working through those potential issues as well. So again, the right technical expertise right across-the-board is being applied and we're using the advisers to the prosecutor and the government. And I think again, the prosecutors appreciate the fact that we got that type of expertise on the job. Yes, they have in some ways appointed themselves as the protectorate for the community. But having said that, we're in a very constructive dialogue with the guys. And so from our point of view, they will continue to do their job. Our job is to give them comfort that we've got the issues covered. I think we're well down that pathway. It's not there yet. There are still a couple of operating processes we have to go through, and I think the guys are doing everything they should be doing and certainly the feedback has been very positive from all of the key players."

Very important parts of it are color, lots of color in our offering because fashion is color, blue and pink in particular and very important is that the pricing is all binary, so 1 carat costs twice what 0.5 carat costs, and laboratory grown because it takes you twice as long to grow it in a lab. And that's very different than the natural business. The response so far anyway, has been much better than I thought, particularly in the U.S., which is where we aimed this. So all the retailers in the U.S., and we speak to all of them, understand why we're doing it, support it and completely get why we're doing it. We also wanted funders to think twice about funding more production given that the margin seemed to us unsustainable in the current offering and there is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that that's already happening. We probably didn't engage as much as we might have in places like India and Antwerp, but that's not where the current problem is. So we spent much of our engagement in America. I'm very comfortable with where we are there and we will keep engaging around the world as we always do."

I'll just answer the last question on Brazil. As Menno said, I can't help but talk about it. Both Tony and I are fellows of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. So our ability to talk to what we've got is constrained by those requirements and they're appropriate. There is obviously lots of chatter in Brazil. People know that we put a hole through something. We are making sure we understand what that is, but there is a lot of work to be done and we've both been around long enough, 40-odd years. He's been around a bit longer than me. You gotta be careful with this stuff because it may not be what we hope it is. And so in the next 6 months we'll do all the anomaly tests. We'll do additional drilling, I think we'll have something more sensible to say at the end of the year. We should [ rise to ] that. But again I'm also aware of the chatter in Brazil. So it would look rather odd not to say something, given where we are. We prefer to wait 6 months and be clear about what we may or may not have, but it's encouraging. Does that help? But anyway it's encouraging and certainly from our point of view the existence of porphyry in Brazil is something that is certainly a different type of conversation than what we've been told in the past. And certainly, I think it validates the commitment we've made to our exploration teams. So we'll see where that goes, okay."

Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche. Two more questions on Minas. Just to understand the process, given the length of the pipeline and given how new the asset is, how do you plan to give the public and all the various stakeholders the comfort that they need? Should we expect there will be publicly available report at some stage on what you found and what the remedies are? And secondly, if we take an optimistic view that it does restart at the end of this year, can you give us a rough idea on the sort of the volumes we could see in 2019, 2020?

Firstly on the comfort point, the technical work -- and we are very open to share the technical reports when the work is done. We're very transparent. We'll think that's appropriate. We'll do that with the authorities and we'll do that with anyone that has an interest. From our point of view, we think the evidence is pretty strong, but we want to make sure that we haven't missed anything. So we're working through that process. The 4 kilometers is specific and relates to a batch of pipes that we know were problematic or potentially problematic and we're in the process of understanding the exact failure mechanism. As you can appreciate, we just want to make sure we've got those issues covered. In terms of comfort, it's not an optimistic start. It's what we think is probably the right balance in term in terms of getting the operation up by the end of the year. Clearly, the regulatory approvals, which are normal as part of this sort of process, we expect to be able to navigate those. If there are any other issues that pop out, might take a little bit longer, but at this stage based on all the stuff we have done so far, we're pretty sure we know what the issue is. But again we want to make sure we've got every angle reasonably covered. So we're being prudent, I think, in what we're saying but at the same time, realistic in that there are still a few things to navigate as part of the process. 
In terms of going forward, again, we're a transparent company. We believe in sharing those things that people should be aware of, and we'll do that in an appropriate way. But certainly, the feedback and the support we've had in the community, the fact that we've been there from the first minute, explained every step to the community, the prosecutor and all the key players, I think they've appreciates how open we are. And they have been surprised, I think, how open we are. In fact, I know a couple of competitors are now using Ruben's work on crisis management as an example of how something should be handled. So it's great credit to the Ruben and the team in terms of how they handled a difficult situation at the time. And I think that's helping us in terms of our dialogues with the community. Seamus do you want to add something?"

I think the pipeline inspection gauge technology that there's 3 different sets of gauges being run down, cumulatively they allow us to take cracks down to 1 millimeter. So when we talk about confidence, we talk about being able to detect cracks in the pipes down to a depth of 1 millimeter. We won't -- so the restart is based on replacing 4 kilometers, and to go back to Menno's question, how do we know that 4 kilometers has to be replaced? We don't. We've risk assessed the pipeline. We looked at all contributed factors to the leaks, and based on that assessment we believe if there are any issues those issues will be in the 4 kilometers immediately after the second pump station. So it's anticipatory replacement, but we obviously won't restart till we have all the results back from the pipeline inspection gauge runs. We've analyzed those. We've assessed the condition of the pipelines, but we're anticipating that we won't have to replace pipes, except in that 4 kilometers."

So very happy with what we've seen from a sales perspective. Certainly, the sentiment's been very solid and we had a recent innovation seminar that we have each year with all our site holders, and they're very positive. And certainly from our point of view, the refusals are very low. That's usually a very good indicator. Secondly, from a Botswana perspective, we never stopped talking to the Botswana government about what we're doing, how we are working together. I think it would be fair to say that we've come on a journey together, and it is a very positive relationship. They've been very supportive of everything we've done. And as you would expect, Bruce and the team are in the appropriate conversations to make sure we get it framed right. But for us, long-term commitments on stripping, they understand that we're there for the long haul. So we'll find the right outcomes. It's getting tighter for us, obviously, and them in terms of value. So it's really about consolidating the relationship and making sure that we're both 110% committed, and I think we're going the right way in those conversations. Bruce do you want to add anything to that? That's fine.
And third on Volcan, firstly, Mr. Agarwal has been a very supportive shareholder. He's made it very clear from everything we've said -- or seen in the press and in his conversation to us that he likes our strategy. He's supportive of what we've been doing as a management team. He has said also that he prefers not to sell any further assets. We haven't been in that process for 2 years. So I think that's a positive. Beyond that you need to ask him, but we're certainly not in any other conversations. The conversations we have with the team with Mr. Agarwal is consistent with the conversation we have with all of our shareholders. And so there is nothing else at play or no other conversations in place. Anything further from their perspective you should ask them, and we're very respectful of that relationship."

Yes, sure. So they're getting sort of too detailed. We average -- CPI across the jurisdictions that we operate in averages at about 3.6% and that's that $200 million that you see on the left-hand side of the graph. We do see a little bit of above-CPI inflation. The way we show that is we net that in our cost and volume benefits, right, because it's our job to sort of drive out above-CPI impacts across the business. And so that's how we disclose it. Are we seeing increases? Yes, I suppose I touched on them, things like diesel, obviously off a $70 oil price. Diesel's up. Shipping fuel's up. So you're seeing some of those things naturally feed through your cost structure. Apart from that, nothing that I would say terribly untoward, remembering that we operate in jurisdictions that have probably higher-than-average sort of inflation impacts, anyway. So for us it's a little bit of business as usual in that that's why we've got to drive those cost and volume improvements. That's why we're so committed to that cost-out journey, because we do see those things coming through, but that was the same the year before and same the year before that. I spoke a little bit at the full year. It's probably a little newer for Australia, particularly in WA and particularly in the Pilbara. They probably had a 5 or 6 year period of deflation, particularly through mining services, where people had spent a lot of capital, there was a lot of capacity there and they were desperately keen just to cover some of their cost to keep the doors open to get through to the next cycle. As those people need to reinvest in the next cycle of capital and capital availability they need returns on that capital. So I think that's what you're starting to see through some of those jurisdictions. Europe has been probably a little bit high, just off the back of better growth, and up until recently maybe the U.S. was starting to [ bubble ] a little bit too. So it's probably in countries where people haven't seen it, it's emerging. For us, I suppose it's a regular part of our business."

They've also got catch-up capital they're spending so they've got a little bit more exposure from a cash point of view as well. Whereas for us, we've been living in those jurisdictions, as Stephen said, so we're little more used to working hard on productivities and all of those things. So it's become more of a way of working and understanding that it's a continuous improvement journey. On the Mining Charter, I think the best way to characterize our conversations and thoughts, the new charter or the new version is certainly, I think, very helpful in providing us with certainty on our existing assets and operations. And that's a big tick, that's a big positive and very pleased for us. So from our perspective very pleased with the certainty that it provides. There is still couple of things that need to be cleaned up, but much happier and certainly gives us the confidence to continue driving and investing in our existing business. In terms of the new parameters, I think there is some real challenges in there in terms of [ freight ] carry, trickle dividend, these other pieces. We've made that very clear. So I think there is a lot of work on both sides of the fence to try and land something that will encourage foreign direct divestment. We've made that point pretty clear, the chambers in those conversations. We're certainly in problem-solving mode with the government. We are optimistic in terms of the long-term in South Africa. We want to be part of that future. So we want to make sure that we have a charter on a go-forward basis that encourages investment, but there is still a bit of work to do on that front. So happy with the key parts in that give us confidence in terms of where we are, but some more work to be done on the look-forward stuff.

Or are you going to get bolder? And then thirdly, the capital allocation, going back to the very first question on dividends. How should we think about when the balance sheet's to the point when there is really excess cash? Are we looking at the wrong net debt number?

So I'll come back -- I'll ask Stephen to get the fine points on his answer regarding the capital. But on the MPRDA, it's been floating around ever since I've been working in South Africa, and that's 10 years in one form or the other. It's complex, you've got the traditional leaders having input, a whole range of players. I still think it's got a long way to go. For me, it doesn't worry me. I think the Mining Charter conversation captures the essence of the nature of the relationship between the 2 parties and that commitment to not jeopardize existing operations and investments, I think, is absolutely critical. I think that's the key sentiment we should hold onto. Because I think the MPRDA's probably still got a fair way to go. And the focus on the charter going forward I think is the other critical element. I think they will then look at harmonizing the 2 and that will take time. So again it's not something I worry about. If you look across the world, the certainty we have in South Africa is certainly pretty robust compared to many jurisdictions, as some of our colleagues are finding in the industry in a range of places around the world. So we can make South Africa better and we're committed to being part of that dialogue. 
On M&A, look, we've always kept our eye on the market as we should. But the good news is, and Stephen picked up 3 points, and I want to reiterate those 3 points. Firstly, our growth going forward will come from internal efficiencies. The efficiencies I talked about on that Mogalakwena slide are available to us in every part of the business and that's the real focus. And Tony and his team, with Seamus with all the operations guys, Bruce and the team, Duncan, everyone, are focused on getting the best of the business and there's still a lot more to be had, so that's the first point. Second point, innovation and step changes. We invested in investment -- or in innovation and technology, because we knew that was the best pathway to growth and effective growth in terms of returns on capital. And we're still committed and Tony and the guys have helped us see a lot more opportunity that provides step opportunities in terms of [ improvement ]. And 3, the internal project pipeline. Quellaveco is the, obviously, the large-scale step, but we've got incremental opportunities across the business. So the first thing we need to do is get the best out of the capital assets we have. That's first, second and third priority. At the same time, we can see opportunities that make sense for us, so [ Peregrin ], the Mototolo conversion and we see some smaller opportunities that make sense and provide us with the ability to continue to improve our performance across the organization. And again, our focus on exploration provides us, we think, with the pathway of very value-accretive growth. So it fits as part of an overall strategy. But we think we're in a better position than most because we've got those internal opportunities. If there is something that's out there that make sense, we will follow it up. We can convert it, we demonstrated we can. But when you got the opportunities we've got, why would you chase stuff that has a higher level of risk. But not saying we won't, but it's got to make sense and it's got to compete with all those great opportunities we got inside the portfolio."

To answer the second part of your question on dividends. Maybe just focus on this half result first of all. So I think generally most numbers that I saw were pretty spot-on in terms of EBITDA. There was a little bit of variance across EPS, given 2 things. One was effective tax rate, it's probably a little bit higher than people were assuming, and that's largely a profit-mix thing. So we had sort of higher profits continuing through Australia and South America with slightly higher effective tax rates in the half. So that's why you saw that the effective tax rate a little bit higher than average. And the other one is depreciation, where people were just a little bit off on, and that's -- we have had new assets commence and we've had increased volumes come through. So the combination of those 2, I think, were the 100 to 200 perhaps that a few people were missing on depreciation. That flowed through to maybe a different expectation on the cents number of earnings -- underlying earnings and therefore dividend. For a couple of really sensible reasons, we are committed to that 40% payout policy. So in the near term, I think that's what you should put in your spreadsheets and that's what you should expect. Ultimately, we will always work our way around that capital allocation wheel and as you get towards the sort of the end of that consideration, one of them is additional returns to shareholders. But as a priority, I would say the balance sheet still outweighs that in terms of just making sure it's absolutely rock solid, as we come into more of an investment phase for the company. So I think it's the absolutely right thing for us to stay focused on. Yes, net debt -- consolidated net debt is one view. I should point out the rest of the world debt, I would like to get that a little bit closer and a little bit more aligned right across the balance sheet. That is part of the reason why we remain focused on de-gearing."

Tyler Broda, RBC Capital Markets. I have 2 questions. Well, 1.5, but question #1a is for diamonds. You're matching the production to the pricing environment. It sounds like things are starting to get bit better in the diamond industry. Venetia is going through the transition. So would you be able to give a guide for where you could get production up to, say over the next 2 years if the market supported it in terms of volumes? And then question 1b is on thermal coal. In terms of the -- looking at the group structures you walked through on those charts on cost curve positioning, the one thing that struck me as interesting, is that thermal coal sort of seems a bit different than a lot of your other assets: shorter mine life, you're getting towards the end of life at a couple of the assets, more weighted to the SA. It's got CSR that's coming up on thermal coal these days. I guess, the question is, is that with the rest of your portfolio having improved as much it has, does thermal coal still fit?"

Okay. In diamonds, we are very sensitive to make sure that we're not running ahead of the market. So we're very happy with what we see and we're supplying to the market, and we have a little bit of flex in terms of what we can do. But as we go through the transition at Venetia and we're making other changes, we don't want to stress that system in the next couple of years. We want to make sure that we're focused on getting our efficiencies right, getting our margins right and not putting more product out there that we might otherwise do better in 2 or 3 years' time in getting that balance right. So Bruce and the guys are watching that very carefully. If they had to kick up a million carats, I think we've got the capacity, depending upon where we are and what we're doing. Longer term we hit closer to the 37 million carats towards the 4- and 5-year period. But again that's based on the transition that we go through for Venetia and making sure that we're getting the best out of the other assets. So we got the potential there, but at the same time, we're trying to match that to the market so that we keep the margins in a healthy place. Bruce, do you want to say anything? On thermal coal, Seamus did a very good speech a few weeks back to the staff, and if I can borrow on how he presented the story, which I think is exactly the right way to present it, we've got very good assets in thermal coal, very good cost positions. We're low quartile or right on the cusp, and we can improve with our productivity. There has been a very significant, what about 40%, 50% productivity improvement in South African the last about 3, 3.5 years. We've got 14 years life on average. And from our point of view, it makes sense to continue to run those quality assets through that process and we're making sensible capital allocations on incremental life extensions. It would certainly be a lot harder for us to justify a big investment in thermal coal that goes beyond the 7-year lifetime on the basis that there are questions about the value that you will see in thermal coal relative to oil, gas and the whole fossil fuel question. So we think committing our capital to Quellaveco and other incremental projects makes sense, but we won't starve the business of capital and we make sensible decisions. When we talk about the transition, we've halved our footprint in thermal coal in the last 5 years and we call it a just transition. We're connecting with our communities. We're making sure they understand what we're doing in those local communities. The governments and the customers that we work for understand exactly how we're going, and we're making incremental investments. But it will be a lot tougher for us to justify a big investment for a long term development position in thermal coal, given the uncertainties in the price environment. So it would have to be a very special case. So carefully considered, measured as we go and we will keep the market and everyone else informed, because the CSR conversation is a very important one to us and one that we are very cognizant of. But at the same time, we're not going to bail out tomorrow and many of the CSR stakeholders are very appreciative of the fact that we haven't run, that we have been clear about the transition, and they said, we prefer that because we understand the importance of your local communities. We understand the importance of those industries to the big power stations, and it's better to have a responsible operator like you transitioning with those assets than having some other characters running those assets in a way that may not be as sensitive as the way you guys will run it. So we're trying to get the balance right."
