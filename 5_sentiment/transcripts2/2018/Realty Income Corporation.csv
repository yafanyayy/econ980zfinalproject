We achieved this growth while completing just over $1.5 billion and high-quality acquisition generating favorable rent recapture rates and continuing to strengthening our balance sheet, becoming one of a handful of REITs with at least 1 single A credit rating. We are introducing 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, which represents annual growth of approximately 3% to 5%.

339305,550774284,1399620,"Realty Income Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I'm going to provide highlights for a few items and our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items and our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. 
Interest expense increased in the quarter by $12.5 million to $61.5 million. This increase was due to the $2 billion of long-term bonds we issued during 2017, as well as lower interest rate swap gain versus the comparative quarter a year ago.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter and 5% for the year, which was in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, which also was in line with our full year projection. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in that 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.61 for the quarter and $2.82 for the year. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a onetime charge of $42.4 million or $0.15 per share as a result of the early redemption of our 6.75% 2019 bonds, which we replaced with longer-term and lower coupon bonds.
As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various nonrecurring and noncash items such as interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption back in April; and this $0.15 bond redemption charge we incurred in December. These 2 redemption charges from liability management this year, totaling $0.20 cents, were the primary driver of the difference in FFO and AFFO in 2017.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter and $3.06 for the year, representing a 6.3% increase over 2016.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $136 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. For the full year, we raised over $1.4 billion in equity at approximately $60 per share.
Additionally, we issued $1.3 billion in long-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds during the quarter, at a weighted average yield of 3.48% and a weighted average term of 11.8 years. Last year, we extended the weighted average maturity of our bonds from 6.6 years at the start of the year to 9.3 years at the end of 2017. Additionally, our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.8x, which is the highest coverage in our company's history.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with less than $100 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our fourth quarter acquisition, is now 5.4x. In summary, we continued to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
And now let me call fall back over to John."
339305,550774284,1399620,"Realty Income Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well.

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year-ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end occupancy. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% for 2018.
During the year, we released 259 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent, which is significantly above our long-term average. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents, as we saw them incur tenant improvements and leasing commission. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Additionally, our recapture rates have continued to improve as we have increased our active asset management efforts. Since 2013, our recapture rates have been 102%, an improvement over our previous run rate of 96%. This is a testament to the talent and experience of our portfolio and asset management teams, which we view is one of our competitive advantages in the net lease industry.
Moving on to dispositions. We also continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. In 2017, we sold $166 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% and a cap rate on leased property sales of approximately 7%. 20% of the disposition proceeds were from the vacant assets that we were pleased to dispose off, given the associated carrying costs. These negative cash flowing properties were sold at an attractive IRR at approximately 9%.
This allowed us to recycle the proceeds into properties that better fit our investment criteria, generating earnings growth and incremental shareholder value. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the year, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018.
The methodology for our same-store pool excludes properties that were vacant, under development or redevelopment or involved in eminent domain actions during any point of the comparable periods. Our methodology is consistent with how we manage our portfolio, isolating our rental rate trends on leased assets. However, we recognized that some of the investment community prefer to analyze this metric without excluding any properties.
As a result, we have decided to add an additional disclosure, which we will present on an annual basis at year end to reflect our same-store rental revenue growth, inclusive of all properties owned for the entirety of the comparable periods. In 2017, our same-store rental revenue growth for all properties owned in both comparable years was also 1% of rent.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 249 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.5% of rental revenue, and drugstores remained our largest industry at 10.6% of rental revenue.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent come from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business.
We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies in 2017 were in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants.
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. The weighted average rent coverage for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4 wall basis, while the median remains 2.7x. This metric is currently at the upper end of our historical range.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range, as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed just over $1.5 billion in acquisitions in 2017, of which $563 million was completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, bringing us to $30.4 billion sourced in 2017. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced.
Our capital costs have increased recently. We continue to invest at accretive investment spreads over our short-term cost of capital, that are consistent with our historical average of approximately 150 basis points.
As a reminder, our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital reflects both our current AFFO yield as well as our cost of 10-year unsecured fixed rate debt, which has experienced considerable spread compression following our upgrade to A3 by Moody's in November.
Our continued low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we're estimating 2018 acquisitions to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit now to discuss acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we invested $563 million in 130 properties located in 27 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.25% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 65% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 16 industries. We closed 30 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $4.3 million.
During 2017, we invested $1.52 billion in 303 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 48% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial.
These assets are leased to 61 different tenants in 23 industries. Of the 80 discrete transactions closed during 2017, 4 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the year, 49% were portfolio and 51% were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the fourth quarter. Of the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 57% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained steady in the fourth quarter. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 175 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our dispositions program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 13 properties for net proceeds of $97.2 million, at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 58 properties sold during 2017 or $166.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and an unlevered IRR of 9.9%.
We had an exceptional year in 2017 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We issued just under $1.5 billion in common equity, at an average price to investors of $60 per share. 
Additionally, we issued $2 billion in fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a weighted average yield of 3.7%, with the term of over 14 years. The nearly $3.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital was used to term out our loan balance, fund our acquisitions activity and redeem high coupon bonds. 
As a result of these capital markets activities, we reduced our leverage and extended the average term on our debt by almost 3 years. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. We have ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 95th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%.
We are proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our 2017 AFFO payout ratio of 82.6% was our lowest payout ratio since 2007.
To wrap it up, we were pleased with our company's performance in 2017 and remained optimistic for 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet all remained healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

We didn't really have a lot of significant releasing activity amongst our top 20 tenants, but we did have some fairly sizable portfolios that we were able to address in 2017 that were set to expire in 2018. One of those was our PNC Bank portfolio. We owned 49 assets leased to PNC Bank, and we were able to released 47 of the 49 assets to PNC during 2017 and extending the maturities from 2018 to ranging from 2023 to 2029, and we were able to add substantial term to those leases and also recapture rental rates that were well above our average for the year.

I mean we'll have to look at that and see. But, again, we're fortunate in today's price we could invest accretively at today's share price, but we would prefer not to, given the current levels."

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items and our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. 
Interest expense increased in the quarter by $12.5 million to $61.5 million. This increase was due to the $2 billion of long-term bonds we issued during 2017, as well as lower interest rate swap gain versus the comparative quarter a year ago.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter and 5% for the year, which was in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, which also was in line with our full year projection. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in that 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.61 for the quarter and $2.82 for the year. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a one-time charge of $42.4 million or $0.15 per share as a result of the early redemption of our 6.75% 2019 bonds, which we replaced with longer term and lower coupon bonds.
As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various nonrecurring and noncash items such as interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption back in April; and this $0.15 bond redemption charge we incurred in December. These 2 redemption charges from liability management this year, totaling $0.20 cents, were the primary driver of the difference in FFO and AFFO in 2017.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.76 per share for the quarter and $3.06 for the year, representing a 6.3% increase over 2016.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $136 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. For the full year, we raised over $1.4 billion in equity at approximately $60 per share.
Additionally, we issued $1.3 billion in long-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds during the quarter, at a weighted average yield of 3.48% and a weighted average term of 11.8 years. Last year, we extended the weighted average maturity of our bonds from 6.6 years at the start of the year to 9.3 years at the end of 2017. Additionally, our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.8x, which is the highest coverage in our company's history.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with less than $100 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our fourth quarter acquisition, is now 5.4x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
And now let me call back over to John."
339305,550774284,1400052,"Realty Income Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2018",2018-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end",923,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end occupancy. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% for 2018.
During the year, we released 259 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent, which is significantly above our long-term average. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents, as we saw them incur tenant improvements and leasing commission. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Additionally, our recapture rates have continued to improve as we have increased our active asset management efforts. Since 2013, our recapture rates have been 102%, an improvement over our previous run rate of 96%. This is a testament to the talent and experience of our portfolio and asset management teams, which we view is one of our competitive advantages in the net lease industry.
Moving on to dispositions. We also continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. In 2017, we sold $166 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% and a cap rate on leased property sales of approximately 7%. 20% of the disposition proceeds were from vacant assets that we were pleased to dispose off, given the associated carrying costs. These negative cash flowing properties were sold at an attractive unlevered IRR of approximately 9%.
This allowed us to recycle the proceeds into properties that better fit our investment criteria, generating earnings growth and incremental shareholder value. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the year, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018.
The methodology for our same-store pool excludes properties that were vacant, under development or redevelopment or involved in eminent domain actions during any point of the comparable periods. Our methodology is consistent with how we manage our portfolio, isolating our rental rate trends on leased assets. However, we recognized that some in the investment community prefer to analyze this metric without excluding any properties.
As a result, we have decided to add an additional disclosure, which we will present on an annual basis at year-end to reflect our same-store rental revenue growth, inclusive of all properties owned for the entirety of the comparable periods. In 2017, our same-store rental revenue growth for all properties owned in both comparable years was also 1% of rent.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 249 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.5% of rental revenue, and drugstores remained our largest industry at 10.6% of rental revenue.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent come from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business.
We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies in 2017 were in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants.
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. The weighted average rent coverage for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4 wall basis, while the median remains 2.7x. This metric is currently at the upper end of our historical range.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range, as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed just over $1.5 billion in acquisitions in 2017, of which $563 million was completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, bringing us to $30.4 billion sourced in 2017. We remained selective in our investment strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced.
Our capital costs have increased recently. We continue to invest at accretive investment spreads over our short term cost of capital that are consistent with our historical average of approximately 150 basis points.
As a reminder, our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital reflects both our current AFFO yield as well as our cost of 10-year unsecured fixed rate debt, which has experienced considerable spread compression following our upgrade to A3 by Moody's in November.
Our continued low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we're estimating 2018 acquisitions to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit now to discuss acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

On a revenue basis, approximately 65% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 16 industries. We closed 30 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $4.3 million.
During 2017, we invested $1.52 billion in 303 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 48% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial.
These assets are leased to 61 different tenants in 23 industries. Of the 80 discrete transactions closed during 2017, 4 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the year, 49% were portfolios and 51% were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the fourth quarter. Of the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 57% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained steady in the fourth quarter. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 175 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 13 properties for net proceeds of $97.2 million, at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 58 properties sold during 2017 or $166.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and an unlevered IRR of 9.9%.
We had an exceptional year in 2017 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We issued just under $1.5 billion in common equity, at an average price to investors of $60 per share. 
Additionally, we issued $2 billion in fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a weighted average yield of 3.7%, with the term of over 14 years. A nearly $3.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital was used to term out our loan balance, fund our acquisitions activity and redeem high coupon bonds. 
As a result of these capital markets activities, we reduced our leverage and extended the average term on our debt by almost 3 years. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. We have ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 95th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%.
We are proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our 2017 AFFO payout ratio of 82.6% was our lowest payout ratio since 2007.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's performance in 2017 and remained optimistic for 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet all remained healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.
At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

One of those was our PNC Bank portfolio. We owned 49 assets leased to PNC Bank and we were able to release 47 of the 49 assets to PNC during 2017 and extending the maturities from 2018 to -- ranging from 2023 to 2029, and we were able to add a substantial term to those leases and also recapture rental rates that were well above our average for the year.

I will say, however, that while our cap rates were pretty much unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year, and the discussions we're having with the sellers today, there's more of a willingness to entertain negotiations and transactions at cap rates that are higher than where they would have been in 2017.

But we view the announcement of those plans and discussions positively. It's going to create cost savings and synergies throughout the business. Rite Aid will be able to expand its PVM business by rolling it out in the 4,000 stores that Albertson's owns and accessing their customers and making it more competitive with the PVM businesses of companies such as CVS. So in addition, Rite Aid will be able to improve their food service offerings and having access to the private label prepared foods that Albertson's has been very successful at selling. So really, just give some size, scale, significant synergies to compete better against existing peers in their sector and also potential new entrants. And we're seeing a lot of consolidation both horizontal and vertical consolidation within the drugstore industry, and we think that, that makes that industry a stronger industry as it creates more efficient company's and gives drug stores players like Walgreens and CVS and Rite Aid additional captive customers.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items and our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. 
Interest expense increased in the quarter by $12.5 million to $61.5 million. This increase was due to the $2 billion of long-term bonds we issued during 2017, as well as lower interest rate swap gain versus the comparative quarter a year ago.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter and 5% for the year, which was in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, which also was in line with our full year projection. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in that 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.61 for the quarter and $2.82 for the year. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a one-time charge of $42.4 million or $0.15 per share as a result of the early redemption of our 6.75% 2019 bonds, which we replaced with longer term and lower coupon bonds.
As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various nonrecurring and noncash items such as: interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption back in April; and this $0.15 bond redemption charge we incurred in December. These 2 redemption charges from liability management this year, totaling $0.20 cents, were the primary driver of the difference in FFO and AFFO in 2017.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter and $3.06 for the year, representing a 6.3% increase over 2016.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $136 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. For the full year, we raised over $1.4 billion in equity at approximately $60 per share.
Additionally, we issued $1.3 billion in long-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds during the quarter, at a weighted average yield of 3.48% and a weighted average term of 11.8 years. Last year, we extended the weighted average maturity of our bonds from 6.6 years at the start of the year to 9.3 years at the end of 2017. Additionally, our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.8x, which is the highest coverage in our company's history.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with less than $100 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our fourth quarter acquisitions, is now 5.4x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
And now let me call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year-ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end",919,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year-ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end occupancy. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% for 2018.
During the year, we released 259 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent, which is significantly above our long-term average. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents, as we saw them incur tenant improvements and leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Additionally, our recapture rates have continued to improve as we have increased our active asset management efforts. Since 2013, our recapture rates have been 102%, an improvement over our previous run rate of 96%. This is a testament to the talent and experience of our portfolio and asset management teams, which we view as one of our competitive advantages in the net lease industry.
Moving on to dispositions. We also continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. In 2017, we sold $166 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% and a cap rate on leased property sales of approximately 7%. 20% of the disposition proceeds were from vacant assets that we were pleased to dispose of, given the associated carrying costs. These negative cash flowing properties were sold at an attractive unlevered IRR of approximately 9%.
This allowed us to recycle the proceeds into properties that better fit our investment criteria, generating earnings growth and incremental shareholder value. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the year, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018.
The methodology for our same-store pool excludes properties that were vacant, under development or redevelopment or involved in eminent domain actions during any point of the comparable periods. Our methodology is consistent with how we manage our portfolio, isolating our rental rate trends on leased assets. However, we recognized that some in the investment community prefer to analyze this metric without excluding any properties.
As a result, we have decided to add an additional disclosure, which we will present on an annual basis at year-end to reflect our same-store rental revenue growth, inclusive of all properties owned for the entirety of the comparable periods. In 2017, our same-store rental revenue growth for all properties owned in both comparable years was also 1% of rent.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 249 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.5% of rental revenue, and drugstores remained our largest industry at 10.6% of rental revenue.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent come from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business.
We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies in 2017 were in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants.
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. The weighted average rent coverage for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median remains 2.7x. This metric is currently at the upper end of our historical range.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed just over $1.5 billion in acquisitions in 2017, of which $563 million was completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, bringing us to $30.4 billion sourced in 2017. We remained selective in our investment strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced.
Our capital costs have increased recently. We continue to invest at accretive investment spreads over our short-term cost of capital that are consistent with our historical average of approximately 150 basis points.
As a reminder, our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital reflects both our current AFFO yield as well as our cost of 10-year unsecured fixed rate debt, which has experienced considerable spread compression following our upgrade to A3 by Moody's in November.
Our continued low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we're estimating 2018 acquisitions to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit now to discuss acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we invested $563 million in 130 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.25% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 65% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 16 industries. We closed 30 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $4.3 million.
During 2017, we invested $1.52 billion in 303 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 48% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial.
These assets are leased to 61 different tenants in 23 industries. Of the 80 discrete transactions closed during 2017, 4 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the year, 49% were portfolios and 51% were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the fourth quarter. Of the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 57% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained steady in the fourth quarter. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 175 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 13 properties for net proceeds of $97.2 million, at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 58 properties sold during 2017 or $166.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and an unlevered IRR of 9.9%.
We had an exceptional year in 2017 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million.

We issued just under $1.5 billion in common equity, at an average price to investors of $60 per share. 
Additionally, we issued $2 billion in fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a weighted average yield of 3.7%, with a term of over 14 years. A nearly $3.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital was used to term out our line balance, fund our acquisitions activity and redeem high coupon bonds. 
As a result of these capital markets activities, we reduced our leverage and extended the average term on our debt by almost 3 years. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. We have ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 95th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%.
We are proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our 2017 AFFO payout ratio of 82.6% was our lowest payout ratio since 2007.

One of those was our PNC Bank portfolio.

So we've always seen over our careers and lifetime cap rates following the cost of capital, albeit with a lag. They're not like the 10-year treasury or securities that on a minute by minute basis have relatively significant changes in their yields. So cap rates tend to follow the cost of capital over the longer run. So it may take a quarter or 2 or even 3 for cap rates to catch up to where capital costs are. I will say, however, that while our cap rates were pretty much unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year, and the discussions we're having with the sellers today, there's more of a willingness to entertain negotiations and transactions at cap rates that are higher than where they would have been in 2017. So perhaps, we're seeing the beginning of that movement, and we would expect to see it occur throughout the year if capital costs were to remain elevated."

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items and our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. 
Interest expense increased in the quarter by $12.5 million to $61.5 million. This increase was due to the $2 billion of long-term bonds we issued during 2017, as well as lower interest rate swap gain versus the comparative quarter a year ago.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter and 5% for the year, which was in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, which also was in line with our full year projection. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in that 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.61 for the quarter and $2.82 for the year. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a one-time charge of $42.4 million or $0.15 per share as a result of the early redemption of our 6.75% 2019 bonds, which we replaced with longer term and lower coupon bonds.
As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various nonrecurring and noncash items such as: interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption back in April; and this $0.15 bond redemption charge we incurred in December. These 2 redemption charges from liability management this year, totaling $0.20 cents, were the primary driver of the difference in FFO and AFFO in 2017.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter and $3.06 for the year, representing a 6.3% increase over 2016.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $136 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. For the full year, we raised over $1.4 billion in equity at approximately $60 per share.
Additionally, we issued $1.3 billion in long-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds during the quarter, at a weighted average yield of 3.48% and a weighted average term of 11.8 years. Last year, we extended the weighted average maturity of our bonds from 6.6 years at the start of the year to 9.3 years at the end of 2017. Additionally, our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.8x, which is the highest coverage in our company's history.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with less than $100 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our fourth quarter acquisitions, is now 5.4x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
And now let me call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year-ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end",919,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the year-ago period and matching our 10-year high for year-end occupancy. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% for 2018.
During the year, we released 259 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent, which is significantly above our long-term average. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents, as we saw them incur tenant improvements and leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Additionally, our recapture rates have continued to improve as we have increased our active asset management efforts. Since 2013, our recapture rates have been 102%, an improvement over our previous run rate of 96%. This is a testament to the talent and experience of our portfolio and asset management teams, which we view as one of our competitive advantages in the net lease industry.
Moving on to dispositions. We also continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. In 2017, we sold $166 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% and a cap rate on leased property sales of approximately 7%. 20% of the disposition proceeds were from vacant assets that we were pleased to dispose of, given the associated carrying costs. These negative cash flowing properties were sold at an attractive unlevered IRR of approximately 9%.
This allowed us to recycle the proceeds into properties that better fit our investment criteria, generating earnings growth and incremental shareholder value. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the year, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018.
The methodology for our same-store pool excludes properties that were vacant, under development or redevelopment or involved in eminent domain actions during any point of the comparable periods. Our methodology is consistent with how we manage our portfolio, isolating our rental rate trends on leased assets. However, we recognized that some in the investment community prefer to analyze this metric without excluding any properties.
As a result, we have decided to add an additional disclosure, which we will present on an annual basis at year-end to reflect our same-store rental revenue growth, inclusive of all properties owned for the entirety of the comparable periods. In 2017, our same-store rental revenue growth for all properties owned in both comparable years was also 1% of rent.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 249 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.5% of rental revenue, and drugstores remained our largest industry at 10.6% of rental revenue.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent come from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business.
We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies in 2017 were in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants.
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. The weighted average rent coverage for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median remains 2.7x. This metric is currently at the upper end of our historical range.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed just over $1.5 billion in acquisitions in 2017, of which $563 million was completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, bringing us to $30.4 billion sourced in 2017. We remained selective in our investment strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced.
Our capital costs have increased recently. We continue to invest at accretive investment spreads over our short-term cost of capital that are consistent with our historical average of approximately 150 basis points.
As a reminder, our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital reflects both our current AFFO yield as well as our cost of 10-year unsecured fixed rate debt, which has experienced considerable spread compression following our upgrade to A3 by Moody's in November.
Our continued low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we're estimating 2018 acquisitions to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit now to discuss acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we invested $563 million in 130 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.25% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 65% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 16 industries. We closed 30 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $4.3 million.
During 2017, we invested $1.52 billion in 303 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 48% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial.
These assets are leased to 61 different tenants in 23 industries. Of the 80 discrete transactions closed during 2017, 4 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the year, 49% were portfolios and 51% were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the fourth quarter. Of the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 57% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained steady in the fourth quarter. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 175 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 13 properties for net proceeds of $97.2 million, at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 58 properties sold during 2017 or $166.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and an unlevered IRR of 9.9%.
We had an exceptional year in 2017 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We issued just under $1.5 billion in common equity, at an average price to investors of $60 per share. 
Additionally, we issued $2 billion in fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a weighted average yield of 3.7%, with a term of over 14 years. A nearly $3.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital was used to term out our line balance, fund our acquisitions activity and redeem high coupon bonds. 
As a result of these capital markets activities, we reduced our leverage and extended the average term on our debt by almost 3 years. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. We have ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 95th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%.
We are proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our 2017 AFFO payout ratio of 82.6% was our lowest payout ratio since 2007.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's performance in 2017 and remained optimistic for 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet all remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

Rite Aid will be able to expand its PBM business by rolling it out in the 4,000 stores that Albertson's owns and accessing their customers and making it more competitive with the PBM businesses of companies such as CVS. So in addition, Rite Aid will be able to improve their food service offerings and having access to the private label prepared foods that Albertson's has been very successful at selling. So really, just gives some size, scale, significant synergies to compete better against existing peers in their sector and also potential new entrants. And we're seeing a lot of consolidation both horizontal and vertical consolidation within the drugstore industry, and we think that, that makes that industry a stronger industry as it creates more efficient companies and gives drug stores players like Walgreens and CVS and Rite Aid additional captive customers.

Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense.
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.7% for the quarter, and we expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.79 per the quarter, representing an 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million noncash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million and 7-year fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule, as we had no other maturities in 2025.
Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly 3 years longer than it was at the start of 2017.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisition, is currently 5.6x. And our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6x. Though in summary, we continued to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,700 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Going to dispositions. We continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate on leased property sales of 6.6%. We are increasing our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continued to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 254 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue, and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue.
We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies had been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants.
This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio's history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.6x. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually all in the QSR and C-Store industries.
As a reminder, we disclosed cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We're pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions, as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants.
During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven, who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent.
7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA minus. We previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016, and are pleased to continue the relationship.
This transaction was done on an off market basis and reflects the benefit suppurated to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on on investment of the scale without creating tenant and industry concentration issues.
These properties are newer vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4,000 square feet and about 2/3 of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store.
In addition to the quality of the real estate, we are pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average, with rents in line with market rents.
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced.
Our investment spreads in the first quarter moved closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we continued to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2018, we invested $510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease time of 14 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants.
We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the first quarter, 54% were portfolios and 46% or approximately $4.4 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the $510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5 to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads.
We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $13.8 million at the net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 7.3%. 
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revised disposition volume of approximately 200 million.

So it's been quite challenging for us to grow that part of the business. And that's why none of our acquisitions in the first quarter were industrial properties. That being said, given the activity in that sector, it does reinforce the views we have regarding the strength of that portfolio just under $3 billion on our balance sheet. So we're pleased to have it. But at these pricing levels, it would be challenging to grow significantly given our cost of capital."

However, we will look at all capital opportunities, including equity. And when we need to raise capital, we will use the appropriate form and the form that makes the most sense for the company."

Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decrease in interest expense.
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.7% for the quarter, and we expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing an 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million noncash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the Nareit-defined FFO definitions.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in 7-year fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025.
Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly 3 years longer than it was at the start of 2017.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6x. And our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6x. Though in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

As I mentioned earlier, occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,700 properties with leases expiring -- recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Going to dispositions. We continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate on leased property sales of 6.6%. We are increasing our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 254 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue, and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue.
We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies had been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio's history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remain sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.6x. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually all in the QSR and c-store industries.
As a reminder, we disclosed cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We're pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions, as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants.
During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven, who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent.
7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA minus. We've previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016, and are pleased to continue the relationship.
This transaction was done on an off-market basis and reflects the benefit supported to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and industry concentration issues.
These properties are new or vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4,000 square feet and about 2/3 of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store.
In addition to the quality of the real estate, we're pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average, with rents in line with market rents.
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced.
Our investment spreads in the first quarter moved closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we continued to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2018, we invested $510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants.
We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the first quarter, 54% were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4.4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the $510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5 to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads.
We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 7.3%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revise disposition volume of approximately 200 million.

We're pleased to begin the year with another successful quarter. During the first quarter, we invested $510 million in high quality property acquisitions, and now over 50% of our rental revenue is generated from investment grade-rated tenants. Our focus on quality is also reflected in our portfolio occupancy, which is 98.6%, our highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years.
We reached this occupancy level while achieving our seventh consecutive quarter of positive recapture spreads on properties re-leased. We remain confident in the outlook for our business and are reiterating our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, which represents annual growth of about 3% to 5%.

Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense.
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.7% for the quarter, and we expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing an 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million noncash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the Nareit-defined FFO definitions.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in 7-year fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025.
Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly 3 years longer than it was at the start of 2017.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6x. And our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6x. Though in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,700 properties with leases expiring -- recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Going to dispositions. We continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate on leased property sales of 6.6%. We are increasing our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 254 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue, and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue.
We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio's history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.6x. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually all in the QSR and c-store industries.
As a reminder, we disclose cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We're pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions, as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants.
During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven, who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent.
7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA minus. We've previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016, and are pleased to continue the relationship.
This transaction was done on an off-market basis and reflects the benefits afforded to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and industry concentration issues.
These properties are new or vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4,000 square feet and about 2/3 of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store.
In addition to the quality of the real estate, we're pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average, with rents in line with market rents.
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced.
Our investment spreads in the first quarter moved closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we continue to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2018, we invested $510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants.
We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the first quarter, 54% were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4.4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the $510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5 to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads.
We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.3%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revised disposition volume of approximately 200 million.

Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense.
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.7% for the quarter, and we expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing an 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million noncash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the Nareit-defined FFO definitions.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in 7-year fixed-rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025.
Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly 3 years longer than it was at the start of 2017.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.
Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6x. And our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6x. Though in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,700 properties with leases expiring -- recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Going to dispositions. We continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of nonstrategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate on leased property sales of 6.6%. We are increasing our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 254 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue, and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue.
We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio's history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.6x. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually all in the QSR and c-store industries.
As a reminder, we disclose cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We're pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions, as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants.
During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven, who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent.
7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA minus. We've previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016, and are pleased to continue the relationship.
This transaction was done on an off-market basis and reflects the benefits afforded to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and industry concentration issues.
These properties are new or vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4,000 square feet and about 2/3 of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store.
In addition to the quality of the real estate, we're pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average, with rents in line with market rents.
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced.
Our investment spreads in the first quarter moved closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs.
Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we continue to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2018, we invested $510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants.
We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the first quarter, 54% were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4.4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the $510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5 to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads.
We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.3%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revised disposition volume of approximately 200 million.

In March, we increased the dividend for the 96th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%... We're proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.
To wrap it up, we're pleased with our company's performance to start the year and remain optimistic for the remainder of 2018.
Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.
At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

So it's been quite challenging for us to grow that part of the business. And that's why none of our acquisitions in the first quarter were industrial properties. That being said, given the activity in that sector, it does reinforce the views we have regarding the strength of that portfolio, just under $3 billion on our balance sheet.

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue, typically consists of easements, [indiscernible] interest income and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with the prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows
[Audio Gap]
REIT defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018 and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

 During the quarter, we re-leased

Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,700 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.
[Audio Gap]
quarter, our properties were leased to 257
[Audio Gap]
commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenient stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue.
We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants
[Audio Gap]
service nondiscretionary and/or low price [indiscernible] business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with
[Audio Gap]
and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to
[Audio Gap]
excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over
[Audio Gap]
of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants.
The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store level metrics
[Audio Gap]
improvements from last quarter, as our retail
[Audio Gap]
level performance remains strong.
Watch list remains in the low 1% range
[Audio Gap]
which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, and investment spreads consistent with our long-term average.
[Audio Gap]
spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased
[Audio Gap]
with our acquisitions. 52%
[Audio Gap]
rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment

We remained one of the only public net lease companies

Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale lease back transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy

Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads.
We defined investment spreads as an initial cash yield on nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. In the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million, at a net cash cap rate of 7.1%, unrealized and unlevered IRR of 8.3%.

40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, takings, interest income, and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity, and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year-ago period.
We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 47 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our eighth consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.
For the first half of 2018, we have re-leased 102 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,750 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade-rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store-level metrics represent improvements from last quarter, as our retail store level performance remains strong.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. 
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only public net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. 
Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline, and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion, from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail."

During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores.
We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.
94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities. And of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield on nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million, at a net cash cap rate of 7.1%, unrealized and unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7%, unrealized and unlevered IRR of 8%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

PillPack has about 5 points of overall market share today, focused on drugs, treating long-term conditions [indiscernible] then, about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs. And these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So PillPack is suitable for a relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last 5 years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information, prefer a face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older portion of our population, the baby boomers. Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing. Alliances with PBMs, so that's helped them capture more market share. And they're also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery, and/or overnight delivery in major markets today, and continue to expand that. FedEx and Walgreens have formed a joint venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is, since 2010, brick-and-mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. Again, this is due to them becoming more, I guess, competitive, and out of convenience. 80% of the population lives within a 5 mile radius of CVS or Walgreens. And the 2 -- the top 2 brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year. Expect it to continue to grow at a nice balanced rate, around 5%, so we're both [indiscernible] not surprising to see new entrants. I'd say, importantly, our pharmacies are outstanding real estate locations that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months.

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, takings, interest income, and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity, and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year-ago period.
We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 47 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our eighth consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.
For the first half of 2018, we have re-leased 102 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,750 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade-rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store-level metrics represent improvements from last quarter, as our retail store level performance remains strong.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. 
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only public net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. 
Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline, and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion, from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail."

During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores.
We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.
94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities. And of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.

I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon's acquisition of PillPack and what the impact is going be to the drugstore industry. PillPack has about 5 basis points of overall market share today, focused on drugs, treating long-term conditions which represents about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs. And these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So PillPack is suitable for a relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last 5 years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information, prefer a face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older portion of our population, the baby boomers. Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing. Vertical integration and alliances with PBMs, so that's helped them capture more market share. And they're also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery, and/or overnight delivery in major markets today, and continue to expand that. FedEx and Walgreens have formed a joint venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is, since 2010, brick-and-mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. Again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive and out of convenience. 80% of the population lives within a 5 mile radius of CVS or Walgreens. And the 2 -- the top 2 brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year. Expect it to continue to grow at a nice balanced rate, around 5%, so we're bullish on the sector, not surprising to see new entrants. I'd say, importantly, our pharmacies are outstanding real estate locations that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months. Based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in this industry, and specifically, our tenants. So we're certainly comfortable with this there."

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, takings, interest income, and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity, and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year-ago period.
We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 47 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our eighth consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.
For the first half of 2018, we have re-leased 102 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,750 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade-rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store-level metrics represent improvements from last quarter, as our retail store level performance remains strong.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. 
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only public net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. 
Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline, and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion, from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail."

During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores.
We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.
94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities. And of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We continue to have excellent access to the capital markets to fund our business and maintain our conservative balance sheet. We remain well positioned to fund our growth through a variety of avenues for the rest of the year.
We currently have approximately $1.1 billion available on our line of credit, excluding our accordion feature. In June, we increased the dividend for the 97th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%, and we are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.
At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon's acquisition of PillPack and what the impact is going be to the drugstore industry. PillPack has about 5 basis points of overall market share today, focused on drugs, treating long-term conditions which represents about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs. And these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So PillPack is suitable for a relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last 5 years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information, prefer a face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older portion of our population, the baby boomers. Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing. Vertical integration and alliances with PBMs, so that's helped them capture more market share. And they're also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery, and/or overnight delivery in major markets today, and continue to expand that. FedEx and Walgreens have formed a joint venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is, since 2010, brick-and-mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. Again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive and out of convenience. 80% of the population lives within a 5 mile radius of CVS or Walgreens. And the 2 -- the top 2 brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year. Expect it to continue to grow at a nice balanced rate, around 5%, so we're bullish on the sector, not surprising to see new entrants. I'd say, importantly, our pharmacies are outstanding real estate locations that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months. Based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in this industry, and specifically, our tenants. So we're certainly comfortable with this there."

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, takings, interest income, and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity, and strong coverage metrics.

For the first half of 2018, we have re-leased 102 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,750 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade-rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store-level metrics represent improvements from last quarter, as our retail store level performance remains strong.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. 
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only public net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. 
Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline, and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion, from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail."

During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores.
We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.
94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities. And of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period.

To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon's acquisition of PillPack and what the impact is going be to the drugstore industry. PillPack has about 5 basis points of overall market share today, focused on drugs, treating long-term conditions which represents about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs. And these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So PillPack is suitable for a relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last 5 years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information, prefer a face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older portion of our population, the baby boomers. Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing. Vertical integration and alliances with PBMs, so that's helped them capture more market share. And they're also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery, and/or overnight delivery in major markets today, and continue to expand that. FedEx and Walgreens have formed a joint venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is, since 2010, brick-and-mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. Again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive and out of convenience. 80% of the population lives within a 5 mile radius of CVS or Walgreens. And the 2 -- the top 2 brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year. Expect it to continue to grow at a nice balanced rate, around 5%, so we're bullish on the sector, not surprising to see new entrants. I'd say, importantly, our pharmacies are outstanding real estate locations that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months. Based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in this industry, and specifically, our tenants. So we're certainly comfortable with this there."

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, takings, interest income, and insurance proceeds, and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year, due to the timing of stock vesting and the costs associated with our Annual Meeting and proxy.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.
Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter, we issued $300 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5x. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6x. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity, and strong coverage metrics.
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year-ago period.
We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 47 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our eighth consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.
For the first half of 2018, we have re-leased 102 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold 2,750 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade-rated operators.
Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists of stores with a larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales volume unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options.
Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.8x. Both of these store-level metrics represent improvements from last quarter, as our retail store level performance remains strong.
Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.5% cap rate, at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade-rated tenants. 
Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only public net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. 
Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline, and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion, from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail."

During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years.
85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores.
We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.
94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities. And of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%.
In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%, and we are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon's acquisition of PillPack and what the impact is going be to the drugstore industry. PillPack has about 5 basis points of overall market share today, focused on drugs, treating long-term conditions which represents about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs. And these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So PillPack is suitable for a relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last 5 years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information, prefer a face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older portion of our population, the baby boomers. Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing. Vertical integration and alliances with PBMs, so that's helped them capture more market share, and they're also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery, and/or overnight delivery in major markets today, and continue to expand that. FedEx and Walgreens have formed a joint venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is, since 2010, brick-and-mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. Again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive and out of convenience. 80% of the population lives within a 5 mile radius of CVS or Walgreens. And the 2 -- the top 2 brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year. Expect it to continue to grow at a nice balanced rate, around 5%, so we're bullish on the sector, not surprising to see new entrants. I'd say, importantly, our pharmacies are outstanding real estate locations that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months. Based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in this industry, and specifically, our tenants. So we're certainly comfortable with this there."

Welcome to our call today.
I'm honored to have taken on the role as CEO, and I'm excited about the future of Realty Income, given the strength of our diversified, high-quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities, and most importantly, our talented team.
I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities. And I'm confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.
I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the company into what it is today, and we wish him the very best.
In my 7 years with the company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts, and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future.
With that, let's turn to the business.
We continued to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high-quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio.
Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02, from $3.16 to $3.21, to a range of $3.18 to $3.21.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico.
81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property, just over 12% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue.
Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business.
We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environment. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continued to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x.
Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels over the last few years. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we released 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have re-leased 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,800 properties, with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the leases have contractual rent increases.
Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results."

We continued",542,"Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector.
Excluding the recent CEO severance payment, we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date.
This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate, due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the S&P upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier.
Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least 2 A ratings.
During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest, as our debt to EBITDA ratio remains 5.5x and our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6x.
The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9 years, which is over a year longer than it was a year ago.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $7.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming due next year.
And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. In summary, we continued to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.
Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion, plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023, plus 2 6-month extension option thereafter.
The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provides ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.
As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan, with the tenure of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan a 3.89%.
23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years. And we welcome the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income.
Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit."

I'll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with the weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries.
Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants and dollar stores. We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date, 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties, located in 37 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years.
On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million.
Transactions will continue to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 39% of the volumes sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties continued to trade around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital.
Our investment pipeline remains robust, and we continued to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remained one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.
Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. We remained confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million, at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date or $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%.
Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we're decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million.
In September, we increased the dividend for the 98th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%.
We are proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs in the S&P high-yield dividend aristocrats index. To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward.
Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remained healthy, contributing to a favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

And what we had highlighted to the market as the types of retail products and industrial products that we were most interested in. And the fact that we've continued to be quite successful and once again, find ourselves with a very low cost of capital. On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital. And if you look at what's happened over the last 3 to 4 years, the cost of equity for us has been, on a relative basis, amongst the lowest. Now with these 2 upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always have the advantage of having a very low cost of capital. I don't think that, that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything, we believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well, regardless of what the economic conditions are.

And some of the other avenues that we are continuing to explore, given what we find in the cost of capital."

If you think about is there a good time for a change, never really is. But the board and John mutually agreed to part ways. The board believe that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. And given the depth and strength of our management team, it was believed that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision. The speed question that you raised, Vikram, I've said that [indiscernible] 2 on that, one is more traditional route where you have typically have a 3 to 6 months transition period. And that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reign. But in this case, both the board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reign and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable.
From what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about. In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last 7 years. And this team, by and large, has been intact for all of that time. I've been, along with the team, very much part and parcel of defining the strategy, and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we continue to have, and that is going to board well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we're going to conduct this business, et cetera, I don't believe -- you're going to see that. So it's business as usual. And what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I have mentioned this in some individual conversations, is have a flatter organizational structure, where my connectivity with my direct reports, i.e. all of the EVPs in the company, is going to be just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes, but that's more in line with how I would like to run the company. But in terms of strategy, et cetera, it's business as usual."

Keep in mind, the larger line was more a function of giving us the liquidity and flexibility on the acquisition front that we thought was appropriate, as opposed to trying to foreshadow any change in balance sheet philosophy. Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be very large. It's currently, as of a week ago, it was under $600 million, after that term loan repayment. And we are not in a position where we need to access capital for any particular reason.

Welcome to our call today.
I'm honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I'm excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified, high-quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities and, most importantly, our talented team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I'm confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.
I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the company to what it is today, and we wish him the very best.
In my 7 years with the company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let's turn to the business. 
We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high-quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio. Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02 from $3.16 to $3.21 to a range of $3.18 to $3.21.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue.
Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have re-leased 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the leases have contractual rent increases.
Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results."

I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue",539,"Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Excluding the recent CEO severance payment, we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range.
Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the S&P upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least 2 A ratings.
During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5x and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6x. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9 years, which is over a year longer than it was a year ago.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming due next year, and our maturity schedule is very well-laddered thereafter.
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.
Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options thereafter.
The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provides ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.
As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%.
23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcome the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit."

During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.",625,"Thanks, Paul.
I'll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants and dollar stores.
We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years.
On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million.
Transactions will continue to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities.
Investment grade opportunities represented 39% of the volumes sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment grade properties continued to trade around 5% to as high as 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spread relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale-leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date or $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we're decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million.
In September, we increased the dividend for the 98th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to a favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.
At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or 5 years ago, 6 years ago, we entered into the industrial market.

On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital. If you look at what's happened over the last 3 to 4 years, the cost of equity for us has been, on a relative basis, amongst the lowest. Now, with these 2 upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital.
I don't think that, that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are and we're going to continue to do that.

These are discussions that oftentimes happen. When you think about is there a good time for a change, there never really is and -- but the board and John mutually agreed to part ways. The board believed that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. And given the depth and strength of our management team, it was believed that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision.
The speed question that you raised, Vikram, I've said there are 2 schools of thought on that. One, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a 3- to 6-month transition period and that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins, but in this case, both the board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about.
In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last 7 years. And this team, by and large, has been intact for all of that time. I've been, along with the team, very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we've continued to have and that is going to board well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we are going to conduct business, et cetera, I don't believe you're going to see that. So it's business as usual.
And what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I have mentioned this in some individual conversations, is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports, i.e. all of the EVPs in the company, is going to be -- just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes, but that's more in line with how I would like to run the company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera, it's business as usual."

Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be very large.

Welcome to our call today.
I'm honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I'm excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified, high-quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities and, most importantly, our talented team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I'm confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.
I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the company into what it is today, and we wish him the very best.
In my 7 years with the company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let's turn to the business. 
We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high-quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio. Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02 from $3.16 to $3.21 to a range of $3.18 to $3.21.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue.
Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have re-leased 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the leases have contractual rent increases.
Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results."
339305,585186288,1598792,"Realty Income Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue",539,"Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Excluding the recent CEO severance payment, we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range.
Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the S&P upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least 2 A ratings.
During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5x and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6x. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9 years, which is over a year longer than it was a year ago.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming due next year, and our maturity schedule is very well-laddered thereafter.
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.
Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options thereafter.
The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provides ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.
As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%.
23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcome the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit."

I'll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants and dollar stores.
We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years.
On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million.
Transactions will continue to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities.
Investment grade opportunities represented 39% of the volumes sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment grade properties continued to trade around 5% to as high as 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale-leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date or $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we're decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million.
In September, we increased the dividend for the 98th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to a favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.

Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or 5 years ago, 6 years ago, we entered into the industrial market.

On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital. If you look at what's happened over the last 3 to 4 years, the cost of equity for us has been, on a relative basis, amongst the lowest. Now, with these 2 upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital.
I don't think that, that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are and we're going to continue to do that. And the fact that we have a very low cost of capital today I don't think necessarily is going to change the strategy that we have in place and some of the other avenues that we are continuing to explore, given where -- given what we find in the cost of capital."

These are discussions that oftentimes happen. When you think about is there a good time for a change, there never really is and -- but the board and John mutually agreed to part ways. The board believed that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. And given the depth and strength of our management team, it was believed that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision.
The speed question that you raised, Vikram, I've said there are 2 schools of thought on that. One, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a 3- to 6-month transition period and that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins, but in this case, both the board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about.
In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last 7 years. And this team, by and large, has been intact for all of that time. I've been, along with the team, very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we've continued to have and that is going to bode well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we are going to conduct business, et cetera, I don't believe you're going to see that. So it's business as usual.
And what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I have mentioned this in some individual conversations, is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports, i.e. all of the EVPs in the company, is going to be -- just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes, but that's more in line with how I would like to run the company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera, it's business as usual."

Keep in mind, the larger line was more a function of giving us the liquidity and flexibility on the acquisition front that we thought was appropriate as opposed to trying to foreshadow any change in balance sheet philosophy.
Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be very large. It's currently, as of a week ago, it was under $600 million after that term loan repayment. And we're not in a position where we need to access capital for any particular reason because our leverage metrics are very good as well.

Welcome to our call today.
I'm honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I'm excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified, high-quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities and, most importantly, our talented team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I'm confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.
I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the company into what it is today, and we wish him the very best.
In my 7 years with the company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let's turn to the business. 
We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high-quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio. Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02 from $3.16 to $3.21 to a range of $3.18 to $3.21.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue.
Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018.
During the quarter, we re-leased 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have re-leased 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the leases have contractual rent increases.
Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results."

Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range.
Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the S&P upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least 2 A ratings.
During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock, primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5x and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6x. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 9 years, which is over a year longer than it was a year ago.
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming due next year, and our maturity schedule is very well-laddered thereafter.
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.
Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options thereafter.
The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provides ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.
As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%.
23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcome the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit."

During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.",625,"Thanks, Paul.
I'll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants and dollar stores.
We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years.
On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million.
Transactions will continue to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities.
Investment grade opportunities represented 39% of the volumes sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment grade properties continued to trade around 5% to as high as 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale-leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion.
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date or $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we're decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million.
In September, we increased the dividend for the 98th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.
To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to a favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.
At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or 5 years ago, 6 years ago, we entered into the industrial market.

On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital. If you look at what's happened over the last 3 to 4 years, the cost of equity for us has been, on a relative basis, amongst the lowest. Now, with these 2 upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital.
I don't think that, that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are and we're going to continue to do that.

These are discussions that oftentimes happen. When you think about is there a good time for a change, there never really is and -- but the board and John mutually agreed to part ways. The board believed that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. And given the depth and strength of our management team, it was believed that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision.
The speed question that you raised, Vikram, I've said there are 2 schools of thought on that. One, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a 3- to 6-month transition period and that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins, but in this case, both the board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about.
In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last 7 years. And this team, by and large, has been intact for all of that time. I've been, along with the team, very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we've continued to have and that is going to bode well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we are going to conduct business, et cetera, I don't believe you're going to see that. So it's business as usual.
And what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I have mentioned this in some individual conversations, is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports, i.e. all of the EVPs in the company, is going to be -- just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes, but that's more in line with how I would like to run the company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera, it's business as usual."

Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be very large.
