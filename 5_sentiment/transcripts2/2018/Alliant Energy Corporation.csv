And I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. On Slide 2, you'll notice that our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share is 6%",988,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2017 was another excellent year for our company. And I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. On Slide 2, you'll notice that our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share is 6% higher than 2016's comparable number. Also, I am reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.11 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. Our forecasted long-term growth guidance through 2021 is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures. It was also re-based off the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share. This was the fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. Our robust capital plan during this time has helped us transition our generation fleet to one that achieve significant reductions in stocks, mercury and carbon and has made our grid stronger and more resilient. We begun the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the retirements of our smaller, less-efficient fossil fuel generating stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2017, we achieved some major milestones including a commercial operation of our 700-megawatt highly efficient natural gas fire-generating facility in Marshallton, Iowa; the start of construction of a similar unit at our West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin; and the announcement of our planned 1,200-megawatt wind additions. In 2016, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the first 500 megawatts of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions. In 2017, we initiated an advance rate and principal docket for the second 500 megawatts. We expect the ruling on our request for the second 500 megawatts in the coming weeks. Construction will soon begin at Upland Prairie Wind Farm, and we're making progress in acquiring additional wind sites to serve our Iowa customers. Of the 1,000-megawatt we plan to build, our current forecast assumes 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts replaced in service in 2020. For Wisconsin customers, we signed agreements with our neighboring utilities to purchase for our wind energy centers. Customers and investors should both benefit as we transfer this wind farm with existing power agreement to utility-owned. This purchase has already been approved by the FERC and we expect closing the acquisition in the spring after receiving PSCW approval. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WPL. We continue to analyze options to construct additional wind farms for Wisconsin customers. Our goal is to make the regulatory filing in the first half of 2018, we would expect approval by the end of the year. Our plans to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast at approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024. We've taken major steps in the transformation on historic paths into the future with many new possibilities. We are closing as coal plant and started turning those sites into beautiful rain gardens or productive pollinator habitats by incorporating native grasses and flowers. The largest sites have been designed to have solar panels installed on them in the future. In several of our retired coal plants have now been demolished so the land can be restored and redevelop for those communities. One exciting project to Wisconsin the generating station. The [indiscernible] College has recently purchased it and is repurposing the decommissioned century-old coal plant into state-of-the-art student center called the Powerhouse. It'll be a showcase of the stable design and illustration of the transformation from the earlier 20th century and to the digital age. As you are aware, we make decisions regarding the transition of our fuel sources, customer cost is always top of mind. We have seen the energy landscape changed across the country where lower cost renewables and cheaper and abundant natural gas have made some of the industry's decades-old traditional sources of energy uncompetitive. We find ourselves in that circumstance, but are doing our nuclear plants in Iowa. The Purchase Power Agreement from the AEC expires at the end of 2025, and it appears that there'll be more competitive options for our customers. So last month, announced on their earnings call that they believe it is unlikely that we will extend the current DAEC PPA. We are currently analyzing our capacity energy needs post 2025, and look for the most competitive options to serve our customers. Before I turn the call over to Robert, I would like to mention that we have the privilege of serving customers in the states that have proven track record of constructive regulation and supportive legislation. As our industry evolves, the policy that govern the way we do business has also changed. Iowa and Wisconsin are very focused on helping customers save money, while providing more opportunities for business growth and job creation. We will continue to be proactive in our states to help shape energy policy and navigate on behalf of our customers. In closing, I'm excited about our achievements in 2017, and we'll focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and other below budget in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition with additional power supply retirements and the development  of our wind generation in the West Riverside energy center; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which includes the impacts of the recent Tax Reform legislation. Tax Reform resulted in $0.08 per share of nonrecurring earnings due to remeasuring of deferred tax as associated with our nonutility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax credit carryforwards. Our 2017 results also include a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge for the write-down of regulatory assets as a result of the settlement of IPL's retail electric rate review. Excluding these 2 nonrecurring impacts and the $0.06 per share and negative impact from milder than normal temperatures in 2017, our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings were $1.99 per share, which were in line with our expectations. Please see the earnings walk provided on Slides 3, 4 and 5 of our supplemental slides for more details. Excluding the impacts of milder temperatures in 2017 and the impacts related to leap year in 2016, we saw slightly positive sales growth in our service territories year-over-year. We continue to see sales growth from industrial customers offset by lower usage by residential customers, largely due to energy efficiency efforts. The recently enacted Tax Reform legislation provides a unique and historic opportunity for the company to to provide material benefits to customers in both the short and long run. We are working with our regulators on plans, which provide our customers with near-term benefits to Tax Reform, while maintaining strong balance sheets. This 1 ensure our company continues to have access to capital at reasonable rates, thereby reducing cost for our customers. We recently submitted proposals to our state regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin, which included a variety of options for customer benefits, including customer billing credits, accelerated asset amortizations, deferral or avoidance of future rate cases and funding for future investments important to our customers. We have provided a summary of our proposals on Slide 6. Consistent with the rest of our industry, Tax Reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer builds. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future. It allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL in their most recent rate reviews. The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on Tax Reform benefit. Our equity over the next couple of years will continue to be driven by our utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, including the wind, expansion program and the construction of the West Riverside generating facility. We do not anticipate any changes to the 2018 financing plan we shared last November, which included up to $200 million of new common equity in additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy  Finance. We also updated our estimated future tax payments as a result of Tax Reform. Alliant Energy now does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2024, with additional tax payment reductions after 2024 due to wind investments included in our plan. These estimates are based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of accelerated depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. Turning to this year's earnings guidance. Our 2018 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged. The earnings guidance by reporting company and our walks between 2017 adjusted EPS and 2018 EPS guidance is on Slide 7. Slide 8 provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC including the impacts of Tax Reform and the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also, note that our 2018 earnings guidance assumes ATC investment earnings and an ROE of 10.2%, effective once FERC issues its decision on the second MISO ROE complaint, which is currently expected sometime during the first half of 2018. Lastly, we've included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 9. These current and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results. In summary, our employees delivered solid financial and operational results for our customers and share owners in 2017. Key items of note include: the Marshalltown Generating Station completed on time and underbudget; an approved settlement in the IPL retail electric rate review; significant progress with the expansion of wind generation; and cost controls for the benefit of our customers, while we delivered on our earnings commitment to share owners. We are looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us in 2018, and believe it will be another successful year for our customers, our share owners and our employees. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the upcoming conference. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conference and supplemental materials available in our website. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

312949,550690266,1401029,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2018",2018-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2017 was another excellent year for our company, and I am happy to share our financial results with you today.On Slide 2, you'll notice that our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share is 6",1004,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2017 was another excellent year for our company, and I am happy to share our financial results with you today.
On Slide 2, you'll notice that our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share is 6% higher than 2016's comparable number. Also, I am reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.11 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%.
Our forecasted long-term growth guidance through 2021 is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures. It was also re-based off the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share.
This was the fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. Our robust capital plan during this time has helped us transition our generation fleet to one that achieves significant reductions in SOx, NOx, mercury and carbon that's made our grid stronger and more resilient.
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the retirements of our smaller, less-efficient fossil fuel-generating stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2017, we achieved some major milestones, including a commercial operation of our 700 megawatt, highly efficient natural gas fire-generating facility in Marshalltown, Iowa; the start of construction of a similar unit at our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin; and the announcement of our planned 1,200 megawatt wind additions.
In 2016, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the first 500 megawatts of our 1,000 megawatt planned wind additions. In 2017, we initiated an advanced ratemaking principles docket for the second 500 megawatts. We expect the ruling on our request for the second 500 megawatts in the coming weeks. Construction will soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm, and we are making progress in acquiring additional wind sites to serve our Iowa customers. Of the 1,000 megawatts we plan to build, our current forecast assumes 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts we place in service in 2020.
For our Wisconsin customers, we signed agreements with our neighboring utilities to purchase Invenergy's Forward Wind Energy Center. Customers and investors should both benefit as we transfer this wind farm through an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. This purchase has already been approved by the FERC, and we anticipate closing the acquisition in the spring after receiving PSCW approval. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L.
We continue to analyze options to construct additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. Our goal is to make the regulatory filing in the first half of 2018. We would expect approval by the end of the year. Our plan to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024.
We've taken major steps in the transformation from our historic path into a future with many new possibilities. We are closing ash ponds at our coal plants and have started turning those sites into beautiful rain gardens or productive pollinator habitats by incorporating native grasses and flowers. The largest sites have been designed to have solar panels installed on them in the future. And several of our retired coal plants have now been demolished so the land can be restored and redeveloped for those communities.
One great exciting project in Wisconsin was the Blackhawk Generating Station. Beloit College has recently purchased it and is repurposing the decommissioned century-old coal plant into a state-of-the-art student center called The Powerhouse. It'll be a showcase of sustainable design as illustration of the transformation from the earlier 20th century into the digital age.
As you are aware, when we make decisions regarding the transition of our fuel sources, customer cost is always top of mind. We have seen the energy landscape change across the country where lower-cost renewables and cheaper and abundant natural gas have made some of the industry's decades-old traditional sources of energy uncompetitive. We find ourselves in that circumstance when doing our nuclear plants in Iowa. The purchase power agreement from the AEC expires at the end of 2025, and it appears that there'll be more competitive options for our customers. So last month, NextEra announced on their earnings call that they believed it is unlikely that we will extend the current DAEC PPA. We are currently analyzing our capacity energy needs post 2025 and look for the most competitive options to serve our customers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, I would like to mention that we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation and supportive legislation. As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. Iowa and Wisconsin are very focused on helping customers save money while providing more opportunities for business growth and job creation. We will continue to be proactive in our states to help shape energy policy and navigate on behalf of our customers.
In closing, I'm excited about our achievements in 2017, and we'll focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition with additional power supply retirements and the development of our wind generation in the West Riverside Energy Center; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which include the impacts of the recent tax reform legislation. Tax reform resulted in an $0.08 per share of non-reoccurring earnings due to remeasuring deferred taxes",856,"Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which include the impacts of the recent tax reform legislation. Tax reform resulted in an $0.08 per share of non-reoccurring earnings due to remeasuring deferred taxes associated with our nonutility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax credit carryforwards. Our 2017 results also include a $0.02 per share non-reoccurring charge for the write-down of regulatory assets as a result of the settlement of IPL's retail electric rate review. Excluding these 2 non-reoccurring impacts and the $0.06 per share negative impact from milder-than-normal temperatures in 2017, our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings were $1.99 per share, which were in line with our expectations.  Please see the earnings walks provided on Slides 3, 4 and 5 of our supplemental slides for more details.
Excluding the impacts of milder temperatures in 2017 and the impacts related to leap year in 2016, we saw slightly positive sales growth in our service territories year-over-year. We continue to see sales growth from industrial customers, offset by lower usage by residential customers largely due to energy efficiency effort.
The recently enacted tax reform legislation provides a unique and historic opportunity for the company to provide material benefits to customers in both the short and long run. We are working with our regulators on plans, which provide our customers with near-term benefits from tax reform while maintaining strong balance sheet. This will ensure our company continues to have access to capital at reasonable rates, thereby reducing costs for our customers.
We recently submitted proposals to our state regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin, which included a variety of options for customer benefits, including customer billing credits, accelerated asset amortizations, deferral or avoidance of future rate cases and funding for future investments important to our customers. We have provided a summary of our proposals on Slide 6.
Consistent with the rest of our industry, tax reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer bills. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future. That allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL in their most recent rate reviews. The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefit. Our equity over the next couple of years will continue to be driven by our utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, including the wind expansion program and the construction of the West Riverside generating facility. We do not anticipate any changes to the 2018 financing plan we shared last November, which included up to $200 million of new common equity and additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance.
We've also updated our estimated future tax payments as a result of tax reform. Alliant Energy now does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2024, with additional tax payment reductions after 2024 due to wind investments included in our plan. These estimates are based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of accelerated depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. Our 2018 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged. The earnings guidance by reporting company and our walk between 2017 adjusted EPS and 2018 EPS guidance is on Slide 7.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also note that our 2018 earnings guidance assumes ATC investment earnings and an ROE of 10.2%, effective once FERC issues its decision on the second MISO ROE complaint, which is currently expected sometime during the first half of 2018.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 9. These current and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results.
In summary, our employees delivered solid financial and operational results for our customers and share owners in 2017. Key items of note include: the Marshalltown Generating Station completed on time and underbudget; an approved settlement in the IPL retail electric rate review; significant progress with the expansion of wind generation; and cost controls for the benefit of our customers, while we delivered on our earnings commitment to share owners. We are looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us in 2018 and believe it will be another successful year for our customers, our share owners and our employees. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the upcoming conference. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conference and supplemental materials available on our website.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Our robust capital plan during this time has helped us transition our generation fleet to one that achieved significant reductions in SOx, NOx, mercury and carbon, and has made our grid stronger and more resilient.
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the retirements of our smaller, less-efficient fossil fuel-generating stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2017 we achieved some major milestones, including the commercial operation of our 700-megawatt, highly efficient natural gas fire-generating facility in Marshalltown, Iowa; the start of construction of a similar unit at our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin; and the announcement of our planned 1,200-megawatt wind additions.
In 2016, the Iowa Utility (sic) [ Utilities ] Board approved the first 500 megawatts of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions. In 2017, we initiated an advanced ratemaking principles docket for the second 500 megawatts. We expect a ruling on our request for the second 500 megawatts in the coming weeks. Construction will soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm, and we are making progress in acquiring additional wind sites to serve our Iowa customers. Of the 1,000 megawatts we plan to build, our current forecast assumes 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts will be placed in service in 2020.
For our Wisconsin customers, we signed agreements with our neighboring utilities to purchase Invenergy's Forward Wind Energy Center. Customers and investors should both benefit as we transfer this wind farm through an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. This purchase has already been approved by the FERC, and we anticipate closing the acquisition in the spring after receiving PSCW approval. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L.
We continue to analyze options to construct additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. Our goal is to make the regulatory filing in the first half of 2018. We would expect approval by the end of the year. Our plans to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024.
We've taken major steps in the transformation from our historic path into a future with many new possibilities. We are closing ash ponds at our coal plants and have started turning those sites into beautiful rain gardens or productive pollinator habitats by incorporating native grasses and flowers. The largest sites have been designed to have solar panels installed on them in the future. And several of our retired coal plants have now been demolished so that the land can be restored and redeveloped for those communities.
One very exciting project in Wisconsin involves our Blackhawk Generating Station. Beloit College has recently purchased it and is repurposing the decommissioned century-old coal plant into a state-of-the-art student center called The Powerhouse. It'll be a showcase of sustainable design as an illustration of the transformation from the early 20th century into the digital age.
As you are aware, when we make decisions regarding the transition of our fuel sources, customer cost is always top-of-mind. We have seen the energy landscape change across the country where lower-cost renewables and cheaper and abundant natural gas have made some of the industry's decades-old traditional sources of energy uncompetitive. We find ourselves in that circumstance with the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa. The purchase power agreement from DAEC expires at the end of 2025, and it appears that there will be more competitive options for our customers. So last month, NextEra announced on their earnings call that they believed it is unlikely that we will extend the current DAEC PPA. We are currently analyzing our capacity energy needs post-2025 and look for the most competitive options to serve our customers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, I would like to mention that we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation and supportive legislation. As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. Iowa and Wisconsin are very focused on helping customers save money while providing more opportunities for business growth and job creation. We will continue to be proactive in our states to help shape energy policy and navigate on behalf of our customers.
In closing, I am excited about our achievements in 2017, and will focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition with additional fossil plant retirements and the development of our wind generation in the West Riverside Energy Center; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Tax reform resulted in an $0.08 per share of non-reoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] earnings due to remea",867,"Good morning, everyone. Yesterday we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which include the impacts of the recent tax reform legislation. Tax reform resulted in an $0.08 per share of non-reoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] earnings due to remeasuring deferred taxes associated with our nonutility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax credit carryforwards. Our 2017 results also include a $0.02 per share non-reoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] charge for the write-down of regulatory assets as a result of the settlement of IPL's retail electric rate review. Excluding these 2 non-reoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] impacts and the $0.06 per share negative impact from milder-than-normal temperatures in 2017, our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings were $1.99 per share, which were in line with our expectations.  Please see the earnings walks provided on Slides 3, 4 and 5 of our supplemental slides for more details.
Excluding the impacts of milder temperatures in 2017 and the impacts related to leap year in 2016, we saw slightly positive sales growth in our service territories year-over-year. We continue to see sales growth from industrial customers offset by lower usage by residential customers, largely due to energy efficiency effort.
The recently enacted tax reform legislation provides a unique and historic opportunity for the company to provide material benefits to customers in both the short and long run. We are working with our regulators on plans which provide our customers with near-term benefits from tax reform while maintaining strong balance sheets. This will ensure our company continues to have access to capital at reasonable rates, thereby reducing costs for our customers.
We recently submitted proposals to our state regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin which include a variety of options for customer benefits, including customer billing credits, accelerated asset amortizations, deferral or avoidance of future rate cases and funding for future investments important to our customers. We have provided a summary of our proposals on Slide 6.
Consistent with the rest of our industry, tax reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer bills. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future that allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL in their most recent rate reviews. The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefit. Our equity over the next couple of years will continue to be driven by our utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, including the wind expansion program and the construction of the West Riverside generating facility. We do not anticipate any changes to the 2018 financing plan we shared last November, which included up to $200 million of new common equity and additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance.
We've also updated our estimated future tax payments as a result of tax reform. Alliant Energy now does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2024, with additional tax payment reductions after 2024 due to wind investments included in our plan. These estimates are based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions, as well as future amounts of accelerated depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. Our 2018 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged. The earnings guidance by reporting company and our walk between 2017 adjusted EPS and 2018 EPS guidance is on Slide 7.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also note that our 2018 earnings guidance assumes ATC investment earnings and an ROE of 10.2%, effective once FERC issues its decision on the second MISO ROE complaint, which is currently expected sometime during the first half of 2018.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 9. These current and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results.
In summary, our employees delivered solid financial and operational results for our customers and shareowners in 2017. Key items of note include: the Marshalltown Generating Station completed on time and under budget; an approved settlement in the IPL retail electric rate review; significant progress with the expansion of wind generation; and cost controls for the benefit of our customers, while we delivered on our earnings commitment to shareowners. We are looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us in 2018 and believe it will be another successful year for our customers, our shareowners and our employees. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the upcoming conference. As always, we will make our investor relations materials used at the conference, and supplemental materials, available on our website.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

On Slide 2, you will notice that our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share is 6% higher than 2016's comparable number. Also, I am reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.11 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%.
Our forecasted long-term growth guidance through 2021 is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures. It was also re-based off the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $1.99 per share.
This was the fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. Our robust capital plan during this time has helped us transition our generation fleet to one that achieved significant reductions in SOx, NOx, mercury and carbon, and has made our grid stronger and more resilient.
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the retirements of our smaller, less-efficient fossil fuel-generating stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2017 we achieved some major milestones, including the commercial operation of our 700 megawatt, highly efficient natural gas fire-generating facility in Marshalltown, Iowa; the start of construction of a similar unit at our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin; and the announcement of our planned 1,200 megawatt wind additions.
In 2016, the Iowa Utilities board approved the first 500 megawatts of our 1,000 megawatt planned wind additions. In 2017, we initiated an advanced ratemaking principles docket for the second 500 megawatts. We expect a ruling on our request for the second 500 megawatts in the coming weeks. Construction will soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm, and we are making progress in acquiring additional wind sites to serve our Iowa customers. Of the 1,000 megawatts we plan to build, our current forecast assumes 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts will be placed in service in 2020.
For our Wisconsin customers, we signed agreements with our neighboring utilities to purchase Invenergy's Forward Wind Energy Center. Customers and investors should both benefit as we transfer this wind farm through an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. This purchase has already been approved by the FERC, and we anticipate closing the acquisition in the spring after receiving PSCW approval. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L.
We continue to analyze options to construct additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. Our goal is to make the regulatory filing in the first half of 2018. We would expect approval by the end of the year. Our plans to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024.
We've taken major steps in the transformation from our historic path into a future with many new possibilities. We are closing ash ponds at our coal plants and have started turning those sites into beautiful rain gardens or productive pollinator habitats by incorporating native grasses and flowers. The largest sites have been designed to have solar panels installed on them in the future. And several of our retired coal plants have now been demolished so that the land can be restored and redeveloped for those communities.
One very exciting project in Wisconsin involves our Blackhawk Generating Station. Beloit College has recently purchased it and is repurposing the decommissioned century-old coal plant into a state-of-the-art student center called The Powerhouse. It'll be a showcase of sustainable design as an illustration of the transformation from the early 20th century into the digital age.
As you are aware, when we make decisions regarding the transition of our fuel sources, customer cost is always top of mind. We have seen the energy landscape change across the country where lower-cost renewables and cheaper and abundant natural gas have made some of the industry's decades-old traditional sources of energy uncompetitive. We find ourselves in that circumstance with the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa. The purchase power agreement from DAEC expires at the end of 2025, and it appears that there will be more competitive options for our customers. So last month, NextEra announced on their earnings call that they believed it is unlikely that we will extend the current DAEC PPA. We are currently analyzing our capacity energy needs post 2025 and look for the most competitive options to serve our customers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, I would like to mention that we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation and supportive legislation. As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. Iowa and Wisconsin are very focused on helping customers save money while providing more opportunities for business growth and job creation. We will continue to be proactive in our states to help shape energy policy and navigate on behalf of our customers.
In closing, I am excited about our achievements in 2017, and will focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition with additional fossil plant retirements and the development of our wind generation in the West Riverside Energy Center; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which include the impacts of the recent tax reform legislation. Tax reform resulted in an $0.08 per share of non-reoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] earnings due to remeasuring deferred taxes associated with our nonutility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax credit carryforwards. Our 2017 results also include a $0.02 per share non-reoccurring charge for the write-down of regulatory assets as a result of the settlement of IPL's retail electric rate review. Excluding these 2 non-reoccurring impacts and the $0.06 per share negative impact from milder-than-normal temperatures in 2017, our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings were $1.99 per share, which were in line with our expectations. Please see the earnings walks provided on Slides 3, 4 and 5 of our supplemental slides for more details.
Excluding the impacts of milder temperatures in 2017 and the impacts related to leap year in 2016, we saw slightly positive sales growth in our service territories year-over-year. We continue to see sales growth from industrial customers offset by lower usage by residential customers, largely due to energy efficiency effort.
The recently enacted tax reform legislation provides a unique and historic opportunity for the company to provide material benefits to customers in both the short and long run. We are working with our regulators on plans which provide our customers with near-term benefits from tax reform while maintaining strong balance sheets. This will ensure our company continues to have access to capital at reasonable rates, thereby reducing costs for our customers.
We recently submitted proposals to our state regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin which include a variety of options for customer benefits, including customer billing credits, accelerated asset amortizations, deferral or avoidance of future rate cases and funding for future investments important to our customers. We have provided a summary of our proposals on Slide 6.
Consistent with the rest of our industry, tax reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer bills. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future that allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL in their most recent rate reviews. The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefit. Our equity over the next couple of years will continue to be driven by our utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, including the wind expansion program and the construction of the West Riverside generating facility. We do not anticipate any changes to the 2018 financing plan we shared last November, which included up to $200 million of new common equity and additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance.
We've also updated our estimated future tax payments as a result of tax reform. Alliant Energy now does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2024, with additional tax payment reductions after 2024 due to wind investments included in our plan. These estimates are based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of accelerated depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. Our 2018 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged. The earnings guidance by reporting company and our walk between 2017 adjusted EPS and 2018 EPS guidance is on Slide 7.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also note that our 2018 earnings guidance assumes ATC investment earnings and an ROE of 10.2%, effective once FERC issues its decision on the second MISO ROE complaint, which is currently expected sometime during the first half of 2018.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 9. These current and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results.
In summary, our employees delivered solid financial and operational results for our customers and shareowners in 2017. Key items of note include: the Marshalltown Generating Station completed on time and under budget; an approved settlement in the IPL retail electric rate review; significant progress with the expansion of wind generation; and cost controls for the benefit of our customers, while we delivered on our earnings commitment to shareowners. We are looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us in 2018 and believe it will be another successful year for our customers, our shareowners and our employees. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the upcoming conference. As always, we will make our investor relations materials used at the conference, and supplemental materials, available on our website.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2018 results and updates on several of our key strategic priorities. After my remarks, Robert will provide details on our first quarter financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
We had a solid start to the year, with first quarter results in line with our expectations. Winter temperatures returned to normal, and higher margins in both our Wisconsin and Iowa utilities resulted in quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, a $0.09 per share increase versus last year. With these results, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. 
I would also like to brief you on several developments on our strategy to deliver cleaner, cost-effective energy to our customers. The Iowa Utilities Board recently approved our additional 500 megawatts of wind generation, which brings our total approved wind generation to 1,000 megawatts. The advanced rate-making principal for Iowa wind projects are included on Slide 2. As you can see, it was a very constructive order and our Iowa customers and communities will benefit from this expansion of clean, affordable energy. 
Construction is already underway at the Oakland Prairie Wind Farm and later this year, we anticipate beginning construction [indiscernible] These 2 sites total [ 470 ] megawatts and are expected to be in service in 2019. 
I would like to thank the welcoming communities that are collaborating so well with our project teams, as we work to minimize the disruption that can come with any large-scale construction project. We are finalizing site selection for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which is expected to be placed in service in 2020. 
In Wisconsin, we completed the purchase of our [ 55-megawatt ] share of the  Forward Wind Energy Center last month after receiving approvals from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and FERC. Our customers will benefit from lower costs, as we transition a 10-year-old windfarm from a Purchase Power Agreement to utility-owned. This purchase was included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of addition of wind investment for [indiscernible] customers. 
We are currently evaluating the different choices for additional wind generation for Wisconsin customers and anticipate making a regulatory filing later this quarter. 
Our plan to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for customers, with approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity coming from renewables by 2024. 
Wind energy brings many benefits, including annual lease payments to fund families and property tax payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. Our existing wind farms have strong performance in the first quarter, shaping an average capacity factor over 40%. Our new wind farms, we believe, are more efficient, as we anticipate the energy production to be as much as 25% higher than our existing wind farm. 
We're also very pleased that last month, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our debuke solar project the first-addition platinum rating for solar installation. This award recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects that highlight our environmental stewardship, our collaboration with local communities and that deliver cleaner, affordable energy to our customers. This is our second Envision Platinum Award. As you might recall that the Marshalltown combined-cycle facility received the same award last year. 
We are making good progress on the construction of the West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt, combined-cycle facility is approximately 30% complete and is on-time and on-budget and is expected to be placed in service by early 2020. The combustion turbines and generators have been set on a foundation and all the major pieces of agreement are on the site. There are approximately 500 skilled workers employed on this project, and they will remain there through this fall. 
As our industry evolves, policies that govern the way we do business must also change. The Iowa legislation recently passed a bill, which includes updates to energy policy in Iowa. As signed by the governor, the new law will increase regulatory efficiency, help Iowa families and business save money and provide more opportunities for business growth and job creation. Some of the provision of the legislation include: an optional forward-looking test year to better align customer benefits with energy investments; statutory language, providing for a transmission writer to promote regulatory efficiency; and an improve process for extending natural gas service to help grow Iowa's economy. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders for the benefit of our customers. 
I'm excited about our achievement so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company for 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below cost and in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition, with traditional fossil plant retirements; advancing clear energy through the completion of the West Riverside Energy Center; and our substantial investments in wind generation; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout ratio; and we will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
In closing, I invite you to participate in our first virtual-only Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 17. We look forward to expended participation from our shareowners, since you can now join a meeting from any location through your computer or your telephone. I hope you all can participate. 
Now I will turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.09 increase were higher electric and gas margins at our 2 utilities and inc",795,"Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.09 increase were higher electric and gas margins at our 2 utilities and increase customer demand caused by colder temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers on Slides 3 and 4. 
Excluding temperature impacts, we saw relatively flat retail sales in our service territories in the first quarter. Slightly higher temperature-normalized sales at IPL were offset by slightly lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL year-over-year. The lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL are primarily a result of 2 industrial customers experiencing unplanned outages in the first quarter, which we anticipate will be resolved by the third quarter of this year. 
In summary, first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 were consistent with our expectations. As a result, our consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged for 2018. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of Tax Reform and the tax benefit writers. We currently estimate the consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also, note that our forecast for [ APC ] earnings assumes an ROE of 10.2%, once the FERC's decision for the second MISO complaint is issued, which is currently expected sometime during the second quarter of 2018. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our 2018 financing plan remains unchanged, including up to $200 million in new common equity, an additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance. Consistent with this plan, Alliant Energy Finance issued a 2-year term loan of $300 million last month. As a reminder, this is part of the total planned issue up to [ $1 billion ] of debt at Alliant Energy Finance this year. The remaining up to $700 million will primarily be used to refinance $595 million of term loans that are coming due in the second half of the year. 
Our future financing plans continue to be driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utility as well as future regulatory decisions on Tax Reform benefits beyond 2018 and proposed changes to the capital structures at our 2 utilities to maintain strong balance sheet. We currently expect to provide our 2019 financing plan as part of our second quarter earnings call in August. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 6. These recent regulatory decision and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results. Last week, both the Iowa Utilities Board and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued their decisions on how utilities will provide the 2018 federal tax reform benefits to their customers. For our Iowa retail customers, the annual savings due to lower federal taxes are expected be approximately [ $75 million ] for 2018, including tax-related savings from IPL's electric transmission providers. Our Iowa Retail electric customers will begin receiving these credits earlier this week, and our Iowa Retail gas consumers will receive the impact of tax reform benefits within the rates that we implemented later this month. Our Wisconsin retail customers are expected to receive approximately $45 million of credits on their bills for 2018, beginning in July. Both state commissions deferred the decision on the utilization of excess deferred taxes created by federal tax reform to future rate filings. 
Turning to our key regulatory filings for the remainder of 2018. IPL filed a test year 2017 retail gas rate review in Iowa yesterday. This filing requests recovery of investments in IPL's gas distribution system over the last 6 years to ensure continued reliability and safety of our system and to support economic development in our communities. A summary of the test year 2017 Iowa retail gas rate review filing and its proposed regulatory schedule may be found on Slide 7. 
In Wisconsin, we expect to file a 2019, 2020 test period electric and gas rate review later this quarter. This rate review will reflect recovery of new capital investments, including the westerly side generating Station. Additionally, we plan to include in our filing a proposal to use access to for tax benefits created by the federal tax form to help stable customers rates over the next 2 years. 
Lastly, WPL plans to file a construction authority request for new wind generation for its Wisconsin customers later this quarter. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and the forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months. At this time, on the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2018 results and updates on several of our key strategic priorities.

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2018 results and updates on several of our key strategic priorities. After my remarks, Robert will provide details on our first quarter financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
We had a solid start to the year, with first quarter results in line with our expectations. Winter temperatures returned to normal, and higher margins in both our Wisconsin and Iowa utilities resulted in quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, a $0.09 per share increase versus last year. With these results, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. 
I would also like to brief you on several developments on our strategy to deliver cleaner, cost-effective energy to our customers. The Iowa Utilities Board recently approved our additional 500 megawatts of wind generation, which brings our total approved wind generation to 1,000 megawatts. The advanced ratemaking principle for Iowa wind projects are included on Slide 2. As you can see, it was a very constructive order and our Iowa customers and communities will benefit from this expansion of clean, affordable energy. 
Construction is already underway at the Upland Prairie Wind Farm and later this year, we anticipate beginning construction at English Farm. These 2 sites total 470 megawatts and are expected to be in service in 2019. 
I would like to thank the local communities that are collaborating so well with our project teams, as we work to minimize the disruption that can come with any large-scale construction project. We are finalizing site selection for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which is expected to be placed in service in 2020. 
In Wisconsin, we completed the purchase of our 55-megawatt share of the Forward Wind Energy Center last month after receiving approvals from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and FERC. Our customers will benefit from lower costs, as we transition a 10-year-old windfarm from a Purchase Power Agreement to utility-owned. This purchase was included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WPL customers. 
We are currently evaluating the different choices for additional wind generation for Wisconsin customers and anticipate making a regulatory filing later this quarter. 
Our plan to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers, with approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity coming from renewables by 2024. 
Wind energy brings many benefits, including annual lease payments to fund families and property tax payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. 
Our existing wind farms had strong performance in the first quarter, shaping an average capacity factor over 40%. Our new wind farms, we believe, are more efficient, as we anticipate the energy production to be as much as 25% higher than our existing wind farms.
We're also very pleased that last month, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Dubuque solar project, the first Envision Platinum rating for solar installation. This award recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects that highlight our environmental stewardship, our collaboration with local communities and that deliver cleaner, affordable energy to our customers. This is our second Envision Platinum Award. As you might recall that, the Marshalltown combined-cycle facility received the same award last year. 
We're making good progress on the construction of the West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt, combined-cycle facility is approximately 30% complete. It is on-time and on-budget and is expected to be placed in service by early 2020. The combustion turbines and generators have been set on the foundation and all the major pieces of equipment are on the site. There are approximately 500 skilled workers employed on this project, and they will remain there through this fall. 
As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. The Iowa legislation recently passed a bill, which includes updates to energy policy in Iowa. If signed by the governor, the new law will increase regulatory efficiency, help Iowa families and businesses save money and provide more opportunities for business growth and job creation. Some of the provisions of the legislation include: An optional forward-looking test year to better align customer benefits with energy investments; statutory language, providing for a transmission rider to promote regulatory efficiency; and an improved process for extending natural gas service to help grow Iowa's economy. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders for the benefit of our customers. 
I'm excited about our achievement so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company for 2018: Complete our large construction projects on time and at or below cost and in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition, with traditional fossil plant retirements; advancing clear energy through the completion of the West Riverside Energy Center; and our substantial investments in wind generation; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
In closing, I invite you to participate in our first virtual-only Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 17. We look forward to extended participation from our shareowners, since you can now join a meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate. 
Now I will turn the call over to Robert."

The key drivers for the $0.09 increase were higher electric and gas margins at our 2 utilities and increased customer demand caused by colder temperatures in our service territory compared to last winter. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers on Slides 3 and 4. 
Excluding temperature impacts, we saw relatively flat retail sales in our service territories in the first quarter. Slightly higher temperature-normalized sales at IPL were offset by slightly lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL year-over-year. The lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL are primarily a result of 2 industrial customers experiencing unplanned outages in the first quarter, which we anticipate will be resolved by the third quarter of this year. 
In summary, first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 were consistent with our expectations. As a result, our consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged for 2018. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also, note that our forecast for ATC earnings assumes an ROE of 10.2%, once the FERC's decision for the second MISO ROE complaint is issued, which is currently expected sometime during the second quarter of 2018. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our 2018 financing plan remains unchanged, including up to $200 million in new common equity, an additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance. Consistent with this plan, Alliant Energy Finance issued a 2-year term loan of $300 million last month. As a reminder, this is part of the total planned issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance this year. The remaining up to $700 million of debt will primarily be used to refinance $595 million of term loans that are coming due in the second half of the year. 
Our future financing plans continue to be driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities as well as future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefits beyond 2018 and proposed changes to the capital structures at our 2 utilities to maintain strong balance sheet. We currently expect to provide our 2019 financing plan as part of our second quarter earnings call in August. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 6. These recent regulatory decision and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results. Last week, both the Iowa Utilities Board and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued their decisions on how utilities will provide the 2018 federal tax reform benefits to their customers. For our Iowa retail customers, the annual savings due to lower federal taxes are expected be approximately $75 million for 2018, including tax-related savings from IPL's electric transmission providers. Our Iowa Retail electric customers will begin receiving these credits earlier this week, and our Iowa Retail gas consumers will receive the impacts of tax reform benefits with interim rates that we implemented later this month. Our Wisconsin retail customers are expected to receive approximately $45 million of credits on their bills for 2018, beginning in July. Both state commissions deferred the decision on the utilization of excess deferred taxes created by federal tax reform to future rate filings. 
Turning to our key regulatory filings for the remainder of 2018. IPL filed a test year 2017 retail gas rate review in Iowa yesterday. This filing requests recovery of investments in IPL's gas distribution system over the last 6 years to ensure continued reliability and safety of our system and to support economic development in our communities. A summary of the test year 2017 Iowa retail gas rate review filing and its proposed regulatory schedule may be found on Slide 7. 
In Wisconsin, we expect to file a 2019, 2020-test period electric and gas rate review later this quarter. This rate review will reflect recovery of new capital investments, including the West Riverside Generating Station. Additionally, we plan to include in our filing a proposal to use excess deferred tax benefits created by the federal tax reform to help stabilize customer rates over the next 2 years. 
Lastly, WPL plans to file a construction authority request for new wind generation for its Wisconsin customers later this quarter.

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2018 results and updates on several of our key strategic priorities. After my remarks, Robert will provide details on our first quarter financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
We had a solid start to the year, with first quarter results in line with our expectations. Winter temperatures returned to normal, and higher margins in both our Wisconsin and Iowa utilities resulted in quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, a $0.09 per share increase versus last year. With these results, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. 
I would also like to brief you on several developments on our strategy to deliver cleaner, cost-effective energy to our customers. The Iowa Utilities Board recently approved our additional 500 megawatts of wind generation, which brings our total approved wind generation to 1,000 megawatts. The advanced ratemaking principle for Iowa wind projects are included on Slide 2. As you can see, it was a very constructive order and our Iowa customers and communities will benefit from this expansion of clean, affordable energy. 
Construction is already underway at the Upland Prairie Wind Farm and later this year, we anticipate beginning construction at English Farm. These 2 sites total 470 megawatts and are expected to be in service in 2019. 
I would like to thank the welcoming communities that are collaborating so well with our project teams, as we work to minimize the disruptions that can come with any large-scale construction project. We are finalizing site selection for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which is expected to be placed in service in 2020. 
In Wisconsin, we completed the purchase of our 55-megawatt share of the Forward Wind Energy Center last month after receiving approvals from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and FERC. Our customers will benefit from lower costs, as we transition a 10-year-old wind farm from a Purchase Power Agreement to utility-owned. This purchase was included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WPL customers. 
We are currently evaluating the different choices for additional wind generation for Wisconsin customers and anticipate making a regulatory filing later this quarter. 
Our plan to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers, with approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity coming from renewables by 2024. 
Wind energy brings many benefits, including annual lease payments to fund families and property tax payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. 
Our existing wind farms had strong performance in the first quarter, shaping an average capacity factor over 40%. Our new wind farms, we believe, are more efficient, as we anticipate the energy production to be as much as 25% higher than our existing wind farms.
We're also very pleased that last month, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Dubuque solar project, the first Envision Platinum rating for solar installation. This award recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects that highlight our environmental stewardship, our collaboration with local communities and that deliver cleaner, affordable energy to our customers. This is our second Envision Platinum Award. As you might recall that the Marshalltown combined-cycle facility received the same award last year. 
We're making good progress on the construction of the West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt, combined-cycle facility is approximately 30% complete. It is on-time and on-budget and is expected to be placed in service by early 2020. The combustion turbines and generators have been set on the foundation and all the major pieces of equipment are on the site. There are approximately 500 skilled workers employed on this project and they will remain there through this fall. 
As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. The Iowa legislation recently passed a bill, which includes updates to energy policy in Iowa. If signed by the governor, the new law will increase regulatory efficiency, help Iowa families and businesses save money and provide more opportunities for business growth and job creation. Some of the provisions of the legislation include: an optional forward-looking test year to better align customer benefits with energy investments; statutory language providing for a transmission rider to promote regulatory efficiency; and an improved process for extending natural gas service to help grow Iowa's economy. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders for the benefit of our customers. 
I'm excited about our achievement so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company for 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below cost and in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition, with traditional fossil plant retirements; advancing clear energy through the completion of the West Riverside Energy Center; and our substantial investments in wind generation; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
In closing, I invite you to participate in our first virtual-only Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 17. We look forward to extended participation from our shareowners, since you can now join a meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate. 
Now I will turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2017.

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.09 increase were higher electric and gas margins at our 2 utilities and increased customer demand caused by colder temperatures in our service territory compared to last winter. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers on Slides 3 and 4. 
Excluding temperature impacts, we saw relatively flat retail sales in our service territories in the first quarter. Slightly higher temperature-normalized sales at IPL were offset by slightly lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL year-over-year. The lower temperature-normalized sales at WPL are primarily a result of 2 industrial customers experiencing unplanned outages in the first quarter, which we anticipate will be resolved by the third quarter of this year. 
In summary, first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 were consistent with our expectations. As a result, our consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged for 2018. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also, note that our forecast for ATC earnings assumes an ROE of 10.2%, once the FERC's decision for the second MISO ROE complaint is issued, which is currently expected sometime during the second quarter of 2018. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our 2018 financing plan remains unchanged, including up to $200 million in new common equity, an additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance. Consistent with this plan, Alliant Energy Finance issued a 2-year term loan of $300 million last month. As a reminder, this is part of the total planned issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance this year. The remaining up to $700 million of debt will primarily be used to refinance $595 million of term loans that are coming due in the second half of the year. 
Our future financing plans continue to be driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities as well as future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefits beyond 2018 and proposed changes to the capital structures at our 2 utilities to maintain strong balance sheet. We currently expect to provide our 2019 financing plan as part of our second quarter earnings call in August. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 6. These recent regulatory decision and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results. Last week, both the Iowa Utilities Board and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued their decisions on how utilities will provide the 2018 federal tax reform benefits to their customers. For our Iowa retail customers, the annual savings due to lower federal taxes are expected be approximately $75 million for 2018, including tax-related savings from IPL's electric transmission providers. Our Iowa Retail electric customers will begin receiving these credits earlier this week, and our Iowa Retail gas consumers will receive the impacts of tax reform benefits with interim rates that we implemented later this month. Our Wisconsin retail customers are expected to receive approximately $45 million of credits on their bills for 2018, beginning in July. Both state commissions deferred the decision on the utilization of excess deferred taxes created by federal tax reform to future rate filings. 
Turning to our key regulatory filings for the remainder of 2018. IPL filed a test year 2017 retail gas rate review in Iowa yesterday. This filing requests recovery of investments in IPL's gas distribution system over the last 6 years to ensure continued reliability and safety of our system and to support economic development in our communities. A summary of the test year 2017 Iowa retail gas rate review filing and its proposed regulatory schedule may be found on Slide 7. 
In Wisconsin, we expect to file a 2019, 2020 test period electric and gas rate review later this quarter. This rate review will reflect recovery of new capital investments, including the West Riverside Generating Station. Additionally, we plan to include in our filing a proposal to use excess deferred tax benefits created by the federal tax reform to help stabilize customer rates over the next 2 years. 
Lastly, WPL plans to file a construction authority request for new wind generation for its Wisconsin customers later this quarter. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Additionally, we plan to include in our filing a proposal to use excess deferred tax benefits created by the federal tax reform to help stabilize customer rates over the next 2 years. 
Lastly, WPL plans to file a construction authority request for new wind generation for its Wisconsin customers later this quarter. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'll first going to give you the headlines of the quarter, and then discuss a few recent events. After my remarks, John will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities and then Robert will provide details on our financial results and highlights for regulatory schedule. So for the headlines. First, we achieved another solid quarter of performance, including benefits from weather. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance range and based on our year-to-date results, we are turning towards the top half of the range. Third, we announced our financing plans for 2019, which includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. And fourth, things are really busy here, but everything is going well. Let me now speak to some recent events. On Thursday, July 19, an AF3 tornado to Marshalltown, Iowa causing catastrophic damage to the downtown business district in many homes and businesses around it. Needless to say, in that most of this town's 27,000 residents were damaged total and businesses and without electrics and gas service. It was a true miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured. We were so thankful that our Marshalltown Generating Station operations center and training center were not damaged, so I am pleased we're able to immediately begin the restoration efforts. With a sure dedication and determination of our talented teams, they replaced 200 poles, strung many miles of wires and restored power to over 10,000 electric customers and 5,000 homes in under a week. The local support of our crews has been tremendous. We greatly appreciate the patience of our customers, especially as they are dealing with their own damage. We are working closely with our customers and various agencies at Marshalltown to help the area recover as soon as possible. The total cost of restoration efforts will not have a material impact on our third quarter results. And last week, we announced our agreement with the Energy to shorten the term of the Purchase Power Agreement for the Dwayne Arnold Energy Center by 5 years, with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. Details of this agreement can be found on Slide 2. The savings will flow back to customers and they are significant. Starting in 2021, customers will save approximately $40 million annually, which translates to na $42 PE reduction and a typical residential customer's bill. This agreement not only allows us to pass these things onto our Iowa customers, but it also includes 4 new PPAs for next tariff, increasing our wind energy in Iowa. It was important to us that we replace 1 emissions free resource with another. Including this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. Alliant Energy did initiate a docket with the Iowa Utilities Board requesting recovery of the onetime $110 million buyout payment to [indiscernible]. The requesting earning a return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We expect approval before year-end. And based on our resource planning forecast, this agreement does not increase our generation resource needs. On the last item I want to mention is that yesterday, we launched our 2018 Corporate Sustainability Report on our website. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and also shows our alignment with the United Nations sustainable development proposals. The 2 key items to note include: our plan includes retiring our remaining coal facilities by 2050; a reduction in our carbon emissions from our 2005 levels of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050; and renewables will be nearly 1/3 of our total energy mix by 2030. I encourage you to review the report to see the progress we've already made towards creating a better tomorrow for our customers, community and investors. And I said a better achievement so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company at 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing cleaner energy through additional wind -- additional fossil plant retirements; completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy. Deliver on our 5% to 10% earnings growth guidance and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

Our results this quarter reflect increased earnings due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. In the month of June, our Riverside and Marshalltown natural gas plants experienced capacity factors above 70%. And for the quarter, our generated energy was 45% higher than the second quarter 2017. Higher margins due to increased generation lowers customer fuel costs. Controlling customer costs is always top of mind. As we shared with you last quarter, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our request to construct 1,000 megawatts of wind generation for our Iowa customers. Not only are we partnering with customers and communities despite this wind, but we are sourcing materials locally as well. We are progressing towards our plan to have 470 megawatts of wind generation placed in service in 2019. At our first site, Upland Prairie Wind Farm, in Clay and Dickinson Counties, powers have been delivered and construction is underway. The turbine blades are fabricated in Iowa. At our second site, English Farms in [indiscernible] County, we anticipate power deliveries and start of construction in the fourth quarter of this year. The powers for these 2 sites will be constructed in Newton, Iowa and Clinton, Illinois. Also, we have finalized and announced the sites selected for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which are expected to be placed into service in 2020. We intend to provide additional renewable energy for our Wisconsin customers as well. In May, we filed a plan with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to build a 150-megawatt wind farm in County, Iowa, an area with consistently strong wind resources. We anticipate the decision from the Wisconsin Commission in the first quarter of 2019. This will allow us to put the wind farm in service by 2020, qualifying for 100% production tax credits, which will provide cost benefits for our Wisconsin customers. We are making solid progress on the construction of our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730 megawatts combined cycle natural gas facility is over 40% complete. It's on time, on budget and expected to be placed into service by the end of 2019. All major pieces of equipment are on site, and we have over 500 skilled workers safely constructing this highly efficient generating facility. The West Riverside facility is the main rate base addition to the WPL retail rate review settlement for 2019 and 2020, which was approved by the PSCW yesterday. Settlement details are provided on Slide 3. The settlement holds electric and gas customer rates flat through 2020. Our ability to hold customer base rates flat, while bringing the West Riverside facility into service, is a result of our success at controlling operational and fuel costs, along with returning benefits from federal tax reform to our customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The key driver for the $0.02 increase was higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers, caused by normal-than-warmer temperatures in May and June in the Upper Midwest. Additionally, we are pleased by the strength of the industrial sales in the second quarter, which grew 2% year-over-year. These sales increases were partially offset by the timing of income tax expenses and timing of cost incurred at our generating facilities in the second quarter. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 4 and 5. Through the first half of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.07 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from temperature impacts that WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin customers. As a result, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of our reserve for WPL's sharing mechanism, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in margins. With another quarter of solid earnings, we have reaffirmed our full year 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 per share to $2.18 per share. Due to the increased margins from temperatures in the first half of the year and assuming normal temperatures in our service territory for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings forecast is trending towards the top half of our earnings guidance range. Slide 6 provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for Alliant Energy and our 2 utilities, including the impacts of federal and Iowa state tax reform and the tax benefit riders. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Moving to our financing plans, which we have summarized on Slide 7. Our 2018 financing's are progressing according to plan. During the second quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 million of debt at Alliant Energy Finance and used the proceeds to retire $595 million of term loans maturing in 2018 and to reduce commercial paper borrowing. Through July, we have completed approximately 2/3 of the $200 million of new common equity issuances plan for 2018. Lastly, we still plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year, with $350 million being used to refinance maturing debt and the remainder to fund IPL's wind expansion program. As we look to 2019, our plan includes issuing up to $400 million in new common equity, up to $500 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. These 2018 and 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plans if market conditions warrant, and as our external financing needs are reassessed. Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 8. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion program and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 tax reform benefits of with billing credits. These recent regulatory decisions in regulatory filings are important components of our near-term operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting many of you over the next several months.

Maybe just to give a little bit of background as to the '19 equity and what drove that at the $400 million level. It's a little precursor. And so first off, there's really 3 key drivers to the new equity in 2019. First is the robust capital expenditure plans over the next couple of years, led by the wind expansion program in Iowa and the West Riverside natural gas facilities in Wisconsin. The recent IUB decision approving the second half of the 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program at IPL solidifies our deal for that 2019 equity to finance the wind expenditures. Second, so our 2018 and 2019 financing plans have also been impacted by the regulatory decisions in the second quarter by our 2 state commissions authorizing billing credits to the customers for the federal tax reform benefits. We've decided not to adjust our 2018 equity plans to finance these lower cash flows, but instead catch up the equity components of these lower cash flows for 2018 and 2019, with the 2019 equity plan. And third, we've adjusted our 2019 equity plans based on the new capital structure at WPL. That was approved by the PSCW yesterday. The new capital structure at the blue pill reflects a higher equity percentage and will issue a common equity in 2019 to achieve that higher equity percentage at WPL beginning in '19. So with the new equity in '19, we're still going to be within that 40% to 45% common equity ratio that we targeted at the consolidated level. And for the FFO to debt, we're probably in the mid-teens, is how I would characterize it."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then discuss a few recent events. After my remarks, John will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities, and then Robert will provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.
So for the headlines. First, we achieved another solid quarter of performance, including benefits from weather. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance range, and based on our year-to-date results, we are turning towards the top half of the range. Third, we announced our financing plans for 2019, which includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. And fourth, things are really busy here, but everything is going well.
Let me now speak to some recent events. On Thursday, July 19, an EF-3 tornado tore through Marshalltown, Iowa, causing catastrophic damage to the downtown business district and many homes and businesses around it. Needless to say is that most of this town's 27,000 residents -- with damaged homes and businesses and without electric and gas service. It was a true miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured. We were so thankful that our Marshalltown Generating Station operations center and training center were not damaged, so our employees were able to immediately begin the restoration efforts. With the sheer dedication and determination of our talented teams, they replaced 200 poles, strung many miles of wires and restored power to over 10,000 electric customers and nearly 5,000 homes in under a week.
The local support of our crews has been tremendous. We greatly appreciate the patience of our customers, especially as they are dealing with their own damage. We are working closely with our customers and the various agencies in Marshalltown to help the area recover as soon as possible. The total cost of our restoration efforts will not have a material impact on our third quarter results.
And last week, we announced our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years, with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. Details of this agreement can be found on Slide 2. The savings will flow back to customers, and they are significant. Starting in 2021, customers will save approximately $40 million annually, which translates to a $42 per-year reduction in a typical residential customer's bill.
This agreement not only allows us to pass these things onto our Iowa customers, but it also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, increasing our wind energy in Iowa. It was important to us that we replace one emissions-free resource with another. Including this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021.
Alliant Energy did initiate a docket with the Iowa Utilities Board requesting recovery of the onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra. The request includes earning a return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We expect approval before year-end. And based on our resource planning forecast, this agreement does not increase our generation resource needs.
And the last item I want to mention is that, yesterday, we launched our 2018 corporate sustainability report on our website. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and also shows our alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The 2 key items to note include: Our plan includes retiring our remaining coal facilities by 2050, a reduction in our carbon emissions from our 2005 levels of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. And renewables will be nearly 1/3 of our total energy mix by 2030. I encourage you to review the report to see the progress we've already made towards creating a better tomorrow for our customers, community and investors.
I'm excited about our achievements so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing cleaner energy through additional wind -- additional fossil plant retirements, completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on our 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

Our results this quarter reflect increased earnings due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy.
In the month of June, our Riverside and Marshalltown natural gas plants experienced capacity factors above 70%. And for the quarter, our generated energy was 45% higher than second quarter 2017. Higher margins due to increased generation lowers customer fuel costs. Controlling customer costs is always top of mind.
As we shared with you last quarter, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our request to construct 1,000 megawatts of wind generation for our Iowa customers. Not only are we partnering with customers and communities [ to site ] this wind, but we are sourcing materials locally as well. We are progressing towards our plan to have 470 megawatts of wind generation placed in service in 2019. At our first site, Upland Prairie Wind Farm in Clay and Dickinson counties, powers have been delivered and construction is underway. The turbine blades are fabricated in Newton, Iowa. At our second site, English Farms in Poweshiek County, we anticipate tower deliveries and start of construction in the fourth quarter of this year. The towers for these 2 sites will be constructed in Newton, Iowa and Clinton, Illinois. Also, we have finalized and announced the site selected for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which are expected to be placed into service in 2020.
We intend to provide additional renewable energy for our Wisconsin customers as well. In May, we filed a plan with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to build a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa, an area with consistently strong wind resources. We anticipate a decision from the Wisconsin commission in the first quarter of 2019. This will allow us to put the wind farm in service by 2020, qualifying for 100% production tax credits which will provide cost benefits for our Wisconsin customers.
We are making solid progress on the construction of our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas facility is over 40% complete. It's on time, on budget and expected to be placed into service by the end of 2019. All major pieces of equipment are on site, and we have over 500 skilled workers safely constructing this highly efficient generating facility. The West Riverside facility is the main rate base addition to the WPL retail rate review settlement for 2019 and 2020, which was approved by the PSCW yesterday. 
Settlement details are provided on Slide 3. The settlement holds electric and gas customer rates flat through 2020. Our ability to hold customer base rates flat while bringing the West Riverside facility into service is a result of our success at controlling operational and fuel costs, along with returning benefits from federal tax reform to our customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The key driver for the $0.02 increase was higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers caused by warmer-than-normal temperatures in May and June in the upper Midwest. Additionally, we are pleased by the strength of the industrial sales in the second quarter, which grew 2% year-over-year. These sales increases were partially offset by the timing of income tax expenses and timing of costs incurred at our generating facilities in the second quarter.
We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 4 and 5. Through the first half of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.07 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect a majority of the higher margins resulting from temperature impacts at WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin customers. As a result, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of our reserve for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in margins.
With another quarter of solid earnings, we have reaffirmed our full year 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 per share to $2.18 per share. Due to the increased margins from temperatures in the first half of the year and assuming normal temperatures in our service territory for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings forecast is trending towards the top half of our earnings guidance range.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for Alliant Energy and our 2 utilities, including the impacts of federal and Iowa state tax reform and the tax benefit riders. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018.
Moving to our financing plans, which we have summarized on Slide 7. Our 2018 financings are progressing according to plan. During the second quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance and used the proceeds to retire $595 million of term loans maturing in 2018 and to reduce commercial paper borrowing. Through July, we have completed approximately 2/3 of the $200 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2018. Lastly, we still plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year, with $350 million being used to refinance maturing debt and the remainder to fund IPL's wind expansion program.
As we look to 2019, our plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $500 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. These 2018 and 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plans if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 8. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions, so far, this year that support our wind expansion program and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 tax reform benefits with billing credits. These recent regulatory decisions and regulatory filings are important components of our near-term operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months.

Maybe to give just a little bit of background as to the '19 equity and what drove that at the $400 million level. It's a little precursor. So first off, there's really 3 key drivers to the new equity in 2019. First is the robust capital expenditure plans over the next couple years, led by the wind expansion program in Iowa and the West Riverside natural gas facilities in Wisconsin. The recent IUB decision approving the second half of the 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program at IPL solidifies our need for that 2019 equity to finance the wind expenditures. Second, so our 2018 and 2019 financing plans have also been impacted by the regulatory decisions in the second quarter by our 2 state commissions authorizing billing credits for the customers for the federal tax reform benefits. We've decided not to adjust our 2018 equity plans to finance these lower cash flows but instead catch-up the equity components of these lower cash flows for 2018 and 2019 with the 2019 equity plan. And third, we've adjusted our 2019 equity plans based on the new capital structure at WPL that was approved by the PSCW yesterday. The new capital structure at WPL reflects a higher equity percentage. And we'll issue common equity in 2019 to achieve that higher equity percentage at WPL, beginning in '19. So with the new equity in '19, we're still going to be within that 40% to 45% common equity ratio that we target at the consolidated level. And for the FFO-to-debt, we're probably in the mid teens, is how I would characterize it."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then discuss a few recent events. After my remarks, John will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities, and then Robert will provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.
So for the headlines. First, we achieved another solid quarter of performance, including benefits from weather. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance range, and based on our year-to-date results, we are turning towards the top half of the range. Third, we announced our financing plans for 2019, which includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. And fourth, things are really busy here, but everything is going well.
Let me now speak to some recent events. On Thursday, July 19, an EF-3 tornado tore through Marshalltown, Iowa, causing catastrophic damage to the downtown business district and many homes and businesses around it. Needless to say is that most of this town's 27,000 residents -- with damaged homes and businesses and without electric and gas service, it was a true miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured. We were so thankful that our Marshalltown Generating Station operations center and training center were not damaged, so our employees were able to immediately begin the restoration efforts. With the sheer dedication and determination of our talented teams, they replaced 200 poles, strung many miles of wires and restored power to over 10,000 electric customers and nearly 5,000 homes in under a week.
The local support of our crews has been tremendous. We greatly appreciate the patience of our customers, especially as they are dealing with their own damage. We are working closely with our customers and the various agencies in Marshalltown to help the area recover as soon as possible. The total cost of our restoration efforts will not have a material impact on our third quarter results.
And last week, we announced our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term for the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years, with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. Details of this agreement can be found on Slide 2. The savings will flow back to customers, and they are significant. Starting in 2021, customers will save approximately $40 million annually, which translates to a $42 per-year reduction in a typical residential customer's bill.
This agreement not only allows us to pass these things onto our Iowa customers, but it also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, increasing our wind energy in Iowa. It was important to us that we replace one emissions-free resource with another. Including this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021.
Alliant Energy did initiate a docket with the Iowa Utilities Board requesting recovery of the onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra. The request includes earning a return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We expect approval before year-end. And based on our resource planning forecast, this agreement does not increase our generation resource needs.
And the last item I want to mention is that yesterday, we launched our 2018 corporate sustainability report on our website. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and also shows our alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The 2 key items to note include: Our plan includes retiring our remaining coal facilities by 2050, a reduction in our carbon emissions from our 2005 levels of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. And renewables will be nearly 1/3 of our total energy mix by 2030. I encourage you to review the report and see the progress we've already made towards creating a better tomorrow for our customers, community and investors.
I'm excited about our achievements so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing cleaner energy through additional wind -- additional fossil plant retirements, completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on our 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

Our results this quarter reflect increased earnings due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy.
In the month of June, our Riverside and Marshalltown natural gas plants experienced capacity factors above 70%. And for the quarter, our generated energy was 45% higher than second quarter 2017. Higher margins due to increased generation lowers customer fuel costs. Controlling customer costs is always top of mind.
As we shared with you last quarter, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our request to construct 1,000 megawatts of wind generation for our Iowa customers. Not only are we partnering with customers and communities [ to site ] this wind, but we are sourcing materials locally as well. We are progressing towards our plan to have 470 megawatts of wind generation placed in service in 2019. At our first site, Upland Prairie Wind Farm in Clay and Dickinson counties, powers have been delivered and construction is underway. The turbine blades are fabricated in Newton, Iowa. At our second site, English Farms in Poweshiek County, we anticipate tower deliveries and start of construction in the fourth quarter of this year. The towers for these 2 sites will be constructed in Newton, Iowa and Clinton, Illinois. Also, we have finalized and announced the site selected for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which are expected to be placed into service in 2020.
We intend to provide additional renewable energy for our Wisconsin customers as well. In May, we filed a plan with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to build a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa, an area with consistently strong wind resources. We anticipate a decision from the Wisconsin commission in the first quarter of 2019. This will allow us to put the wind farm in service by 2020, qualifying for 100% production tax credits which will provide cost benefits for our Wisconsin customers.
We are making solid progress on the construction of our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas facility is over 40% complete. It's on time, on budget and expected to be placed into service by the end of 2019. All major pieces of equipment are on site, and we have over 500 skilled workers safely constructing this highly efficient generating facility. The West Riverside facility is the main rate base addition to the WPL retail rate review settlement for 2019 and 2020, which was approved by the PSCW yesterday. 
Settlement details are provided on Slide 3. The settlement holds electric and gas customer rates flat through 2020. Our ability to hold customer base rates flat while bringing the West Riverside facility into service is a result of our success at controlling operational and fuel costs, along with returning benefits from federal tax reform to our customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Good morning, everyone.Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017.

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The key driver for the $0.02 increase was higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers caused by warmer-than-normal temperatures in May and June in the upper Midwest. Additionally, we are pleased by the strength of the industrial sales in the second quarter, which grew 2% year-over-year. These sales increases were partially offset by the timing of income tax expenses and timing of costs incurred at our generating facilities in the second quarter.
We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 4 and 5. Through the first half of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.07 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect a majority of the higher margins resulting from temperature impacts at WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin customers. As a result, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of our reserve for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in margins.
With another quarter of solid earnings, we have reaffirmed our full year 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 per share to $2.18 per share. Due to the increased margins from temperatures in the first half of the year and assuming normal temperatures in our service territory for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings forecast is trending towards the top half of our earnings guidance range.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for Alliant Energy and our 2 utilities, including the impacts of federal and Iowa state tax reform and the tax benefit riders, we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018.
Moving to our financing plans, which we have summarized on Slide 7. Our 2018 financings are progressing according to plan. During the second quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance and used the proceeds to retire $595 million of term loans maturing in 2018 and to reduce commercial paper borrowing. Through July, we have completed approximately 2/3 of the $200 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2018. Lastly, we still plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year, with $350 million being used to refinance maturing debt and the remainder to fund IPL's wind expansion program.
As we look to 2019, our plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $500 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. These 2018 and 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plans if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 8. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions, so far, this year that support our wind expansion program and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 tax reform benefits with billing credits. These recent regulatory decisions and regulatory filings are important components of our near-term operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months.

Maybe to give just a little bit of background as to the '19 equity and what drove that at the $400 million level as a little precursor. So first off, there's really 3 key drivers to the new equity in 2019. First is the robust capital expenditure plans over the next couple years, led by the wind expansion program in Iowa and the West Riverside natural gas facilities in Wisconsin. The recent IUB decision approving the second half of the 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program at IPL solidifies our need for that 2019 equity to finance the wind expenditures. Second, so our 2018 and 2019 financing plans have also been impacted by the regulatory decisions in the second quarter by our 2 state commissions authorizing billing credits for the customers for the federal tax reform benefits. We've decided not to adjust our 2018 equity plans to finance these lower cash flows but instead catch-up the equity components of these lower cash flows for 2018 and 2019 with the 2019 equity plan. And third, we've adjusted our 2019 equity plans based on the new capital structure at WPL that was approved by the PSCW yesterday. The new capital structure at WPL reflects a higher equity percentage. And we'll issue common equity in 2019 to achieve that higher equity percentage at WPL, beginning in '19. So with the new equity in '19, we're still going to be within that 40% to 45% common equity ratio that we target at the consolidated level. And for the FFO-to-debt, we're probably in the mid-teens, is how I would characterize it."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then discuss a few recent events. After my remarks, John will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities, and then Robert will provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.
So for the headlines. First, we achieved another solid quarter of performance, including benefits from weather. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance range, and based on our year-to-date results, we are turning towards the top half of the range. Third, we announced our financing plans for 2019, which includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. And fourth, things are really busy here, but everything is going well.
Let me now speak to some recent events. On Thursday, July 19, an EF-3 tornado tore through Marshalltown, Iowa, causing catastrophic damage to the downtown business district and many homes and businesses around it. Needless to say is that most of this town's 27,000 residents -- with damaged homes and businesses and without electric and gas service, it was a true miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured. We were so thankful that our Marshalltown Generating Station operations center and training center were not damaged, so our employees were able to immediately begin the restoration efforts. With the sheer dedication and determination of our talented teams, they replaced 200 poles, strung many miles of wires and restored power to over 10,000 electric customers and nearly 5,000 homes in under a week.
The local support of our crews has been tremendous. We greatly appreciate the patience of our customers, especially as they are dealing with their own damage. We are working closely with our customers and the various agencies in Marshalltown to help the area recover as soon as possible. The total cost of our restoration efforts will not have a material impact on our third quarter results.
And last week, we announced our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term for the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years, with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. Details of this agreement can be found on Slide 2. The savings will flow back to customers, and they are significant. Starting in 2021, customers will save approximately $40 million annually, which translates to a $42 per-year reduction in a typical residential customer's bill.
This agreement not only allows us to pass these things onto our Iowa customers, but it also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, increasing our wind energy in Iowa. It was important to us that we replace one emissions-free resource with another. Including this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021.
Alliant Energy did initiate a docket with the Iowa Utilities Board requesting recovery of the onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra. The request includes earning a return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We expect approval before year-end. And based on our resource planning forecast, this agreement does not increase our generation resource needs.
And the last item I want to mention is that yesterday, we launched our 2018 corporate sustainability report on our website. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and also shows our alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The 2 key items to note include: Our plan includes retiring our remaining coal facilities by 2050, a reduction in our carbon emissions from our 2005 levels of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. And renewables will be nearly 1/3 of our total energy mix by 2030. I encourage you to review the report and see the progress we've already made towards creating a better tomorrow for our customers, community and investors.
I'm excited about our achievements so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company in 2018: complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing cleaner energy through additional wind -- additional fossil plant retirements, completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on our 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

Our results this quarter reflect increased earnings due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy.
In the month of June, our Riverside and Marshalltown natural gas plants experienced capacity factors above 70%. And for the quarter, our generated energy was 45% higher than second quarter 2017. Higher margins due to increased generation lowers customer fuel costs. Controlling customer costs is always top of mind.
As we shared with you last quarter, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our request to construct 1,000 megawatts of wind generation for our Iowa customers. Not only are we partnering with customers and communities [ to site ] this wind, but we are sourcing materials locally as well. We are progressing towards our plan to have 470 megawatts of wind generation placed in service in 2019. At our first site, Upland Prairie Wind Farm in Clay and Dickinson counties, powers have been delivered and construction is underway. The turbine blades are fabricated in Newton, Iowa. At our second site, English Farms in Poweshiek County, we anticipate tower deliveries and start of construction in the fourth quarter of this year. The towers for these 2 sites will be constructed in Newton, Iowa and Clinton, Illinois. Also, we have finalized and announced the site selected for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which are expected to be placed into service in 2020.
We intend to provide additional renewable energy for our Wisconsin customers as well. In May, we filed a plan with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to build a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa, an area with consistently strong wind resources. We anticipate a decision from the Wisconsin commission in the first quarter of 2019. This will allow us to put the wind farm in service by 2020, qualifying for 100% production tax credits which will provide cost benefits for our Wisconsin customers.
We are making solid progress on the construction of our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas facility is over 40% complete. It's on time, on budget and expected to be placed into service by the end of 2019. All major pieces of equipment are on site, and we have over 500 skilled workers safely constructing this highly efficient generating facility. The West Riverside facility is the main rate base addition to the WPL retail rate review settlement for 2019 and 2020, which was approved by the PSCW yesterday. 
Settlement details are provided on Slide 3. The settlement holds electric and gas customer rates flat through 2020. Our ability to hold customer base rates flat while bringing the West Riverside facility into service is a result of our success at controlling operational and fuel costs, along with returning benefits from federal tax reform to our customers.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Good morning, everyone.Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017.

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The key driver for the $0.02 increase was higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers caused by warmer-than-normal temperatures in May and June in the upper Midwest. Additionally, we are pleased by the strength of the industrial sales in the second quarter, which grew 2% year-over-year. These sales increases were partially offset by the timing of income tax expenses and timing of costs incurred at our generating facilities in the second quarter.
We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 4 and 5. Through the first half of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.07 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect a majority of the higher margins resulting from temperature impacts at WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin customers. As a result, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of our reserve for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in margins.
With another quarter of solid earnings, we have reaffirmed our full year 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 per share to $2.18 per share. Due to the increased margins from temperatures in the first half of the year and assuming normal temperatures in our service territory for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings forecast is trending towards the top half of our earnings guidance range.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for Alliant Energy and our 2 utilities, including the impacts of federal and Iowa state tax reform and the tax benefit riders, we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018.
Moving to our financing plans, which we have summarized on Slide 7. Our 2018 financings are progressing according to plan. During the second quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance and used the proceeds to retire $595 million of term loans maturing in 2018 and to reduce commercial paper borrowing. Through July, we have completed approximately 2/3 of the $200 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2018. Lastly, we still plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year, with $350 million being used to refinance maturing debt and the remainder to fund IPL's wind expansion program.
As we look to 2019, our plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $500 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. These 2018 and 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plans if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 8. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions, so far, this year that support our wind expansion program and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 tax reform benefits with billing credits. These recent regulatory decisions and regulatory filings are important components of our near-term operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Maybe to give just a little bit of background as to the '19 equity and what drove that at the $400 million level as a little precursor. So first off, there's really 3 key drivers to the new equity in 2019. First is the robust capital expenditure plans over the next couple years, led by the wind expansion program in Iowa and the West Riverside natural gas facilities in Wisconsin. The recent IUB decision approving the second half of the 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program at IPL solidifies our need for that 2019 equity to finance the wind expenditures. Second, so our 2018 and 2019 financing plans have also been impacted by the regulatory decisions in the second quarter by our 2 state commissions authorizing billing credits for the customers for the federal tax reform benefits. We've decided not to adjust our 2018 equity plans to finance these lower cash flows but instead catch-up the equity components of these lower cash flows for 2018 and 2019 with the 2019 equity plan. And third, we've adjusted our 2019 equity plans based on the new capital structure at WPL that was approved by the PSCW yesterday. The new capital structure at WPL reflects a higher equity percentage. And we'll issue common equity in 2019 to achieve that higher equity percentage at WPL, beginning in '19. So with the new equity in '19, we're still going to be within that 40% to 45% common equity ratio that we target at the consolidated level. And for the FFO-to-debt, we're probably in the mid-teens, is how I would characterize it."

I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature. Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share, with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the 6 year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later on the call. Now let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings. We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan from the [ $7 billion ] as shown on Slide 3. To your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4. Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020, is driven mostly by anticipated gas expansion project in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade that the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and, therefore, reduced CapEx for these projects. In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 and 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making the 10-year plan total to $12.7 billion. Over 1/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investment in electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardized voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We're also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing. And speaking of our communities, Mother Nature was to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Some of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after [indiscernible] cost catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of home and businesses suffered major damage during the severe flood that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generally assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance. In last month, we filed a settlement with the Iowa Utilities Board regarding our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Energy Center by 5 years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. As we shared with you last quarter, beginning in 2021, our customers will save approximately $60 million annually. This agreement also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, which will increase our wind energy in Iowa. With this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. [indiscernible] recovery of a onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra in 2020, including earning return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We have not included this payment in our capital expenditure plan when we recorded as a regulatory assets. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board decision of this settlement agreement before year-end. Before I conclude my remarks, I do want to comment on the midterm elections. First, they are over and we can all go back to watching TV and answering the phones. I would also assume that your recycle mail pile will now be much smaller. But seriously, we work hard to have good relationships with all elected officials, community leaders, regulators and customers no matter what party is in the lead. We look forward to working with the Iowa government Reynolds and Wisconsin government like and we will continue to support policies that serve our customers and our company well. And Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 veterans that work at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the military families for everything they do or their loved ones away from home. And special happy birthday shoutout to the U.S. Marine Corps. extend accomplishment so far this year, we will look forward to achieving our goals for 2019. Our team will continue focusing on in the following: complete our large construction projects on time and at/or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advance cleaner energy through additional fossil plant retirements, construction of West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 6% to 70% common dividend payout target and we'll continue manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

As Pat mentioned, we experienced warmer-than-normal temperatures in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. The year-to-date capacity factors at our combined cycle gas facilities had been over 55%. Efficient and responsive gas generation is a great market participant as well as a great compliment for existing and future wind resources. We continue to make great progress on our generation transformation. At the end of September, Unit 4 at our Edgewater generating station was retired. This unit was a 351-megawatt coal-fired generator, which was placed in service in 1969. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the dedicated employees who operated and maintained this unit, providing nearly 50 years of reliable power for our Wisconsin customers. Retiring this unit was another step in our plan to energy transformation to focus on customer cost, carbon reduction and advancing clean energy solutions. With the retirement of Edgewater 4, we have now retired or converted approximately 50% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. A key part of our generation transformation includes adding efficient natural gas and renewable energy. In Wisconsin, we're making good progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 50% complete and is expected to go into service by the end of 2019. We are also advancing renewable energy with our proposed 150-megawatt Kossuth County wind project. We anticipate a decision on this wind resource in the first quarter of 2019. These 2 resource additions will replace the power from the Wisconsin coal facilities retired to date and help advance clean energy for our Wisconsin customers. Moving onto our Iowa generation investments. We are making great progress in our plans to add 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. The new wind will be placed into service in 2 phases: the first phase totals 470 megawatts, and will be in service during the first quarter of 2019. This phase has 2 projects: the 300 megawatts Upland Prairie project and the 170 megawatts English farms project. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. The remaining 530 megawatts of wind is expected to be placed in service in 2020. We believe our generation investments encourage economic development and job creation, while meeting customer expectations for cleaner energy. We continue to work with state and local agencies to encourage further economic growth in our service territory. Last month, we celebrated as our big Cedar Industrial Park became the first site in Iowa to received the mega site certification. This 1,300 side located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa has multimodal transportation options including air, rail and highway access. In addition, Alliant Energy's nonregulated transportation division, AET, is developing a 75-acre logistics park adjacent to big Cedar, offering a multitude of supply chain, transportation and logistics services. AET has also recently announced plans to acquire hybrid transit systems, a freight management services company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Along with big Cedar Industrial Park and the Cedar Rapids, our company has also economic -- also, has economic growth sites and aims in Iowa and Dam, Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were: higher electric sales caused by warmer temperatures and higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 5 and 6. For the first 9 months of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.09 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at Iowa will be given back to our Wisconsin retail customers. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance base based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance expense. Therefore, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be $0.05 per share increase in earnings. As Pat mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share, a low from the midpoint of 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including: WPL's West Riverside Energy Center, and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's interim rates, following our anticipated retail electric rate filing early next year. We are forecasting IPL's interim electric base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2019. The 2019 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2018. We are forecasting both of these sales growth in commercial and industrial customers in our Wisconsin service territory. Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate our consolidated effective tax rate of 10% for 2018 and 9% for 2019. We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. We are currently delivering the 2018 savings from Federal Tax Reform to our customers in both Iowa and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, we will also hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service in late 2019. We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. We have recently renegotiated to reduce transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency spend beginning in 2019. And earlier this month, FERC issues an order to lower the independent that our transmission service providers allowed, thereby reducing expenses to our customers. Last quarter, we also shared with you that we entered an agreement to shorten the delay on energy center purchase power agreement with NextEra, and add 340 megawatts of wind PPAs, which will begin saving our customers money in 2021. Lastly, as we bring our plan wind into with projects into service, lower fuel expenses and production tax credits for our Iowa customers were largely offset the impacts of increases in renewables rate base. Moving to our financing plans which had been summarized on Slide 9. We have completed our key financings for 2018, with the issuance of a $500 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind and solar generation projects in Iowa. As we look to 2019, our financing plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. This 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant, and as our external financing needs are reassessed. Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives and noted on Slide 10. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion programs and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 Federal Tax Reform benefits with billing credits. Also, since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the DAEC PPA docket and the IPL test year 2017 retail gas rate review. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. Thank you. We very much appreciate your continued support of the company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and November 2018 factbook which detailed the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures to 2022 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

312949,588446808,1595585,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Sue.

I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature.
Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the sixth year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later on the call.
Now, let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.
We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan totaling $7 billion as shown on Slide 3. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4.
Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020 is driven mostly by several anticipated gas expansion projects in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade at the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and therefore reduce CapEx for these projects.
In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 through 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making a 10-year plan total of $12.7 billion. Over 1/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investments in electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardize voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We are also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing.
And speaking of our communities, mother nature was kind to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Several of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after an EF-3 tornado caused catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of homes and businesses suffered major damage during the severe flood that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and it has taken an incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generously assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance.
And last month, we filed a settlement with the Iowa Utilities Board regarding our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. As we shared with you last quarter, beginning in 2021, our customers will save approximately $60 million annually. This agreement also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, which will increase our wind energy in Iowa. With this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. The agreement includes recovery of a onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra in 2020, including earning return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We have not included this payment in our capital expenditure plan since it would be recorded as a regulatory asset. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board decision on this settlement agreement before year-end.
Before I conclude my remarks, I do want to comment on the midterm elections. First, they are over and we can all go back to watching TV and answering the phones. I would also assume that your recycle mail pile will now be much smaller. But seriously, we work hard to have good relationships with all elected officials, community leaders, regulators and customers no matter what party is in the lead. We look forward to working with Iowa Governor Reynolds and Wisconsin Governor-elect Evers. We will continue to support policies that serve our customers and our company well.
And with Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 powered veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. And a special happy birthday shout-out to the U.S. Marine Corps. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments so far this year and we look forward to achieving our goals for 2019. Our team will continue focusing on the following: Complete our large construction projects on time and at/or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advance cleaner energy through additional fossil plant retirements, construction of West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

As Pat mentioned, we experienced warmer than normal temperatures in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. The year-to-date capacity factors at our combined cycle gas facilities have been over 55%. Efficient and responsive gas generation is a great market participant as well as a great complement for existing and future wind resources.
We continue to make great progress on our generation transformation. At the end of September, Unit 4 at our Edgewater generating station was retired. This unit was a 351-megawatt coal-fired generator, which was placed in service in 1969. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the dedicated employees who operated and maintained this unit, providing nearly 50 years of reliable power for our Wisconsin customers. Retiring this unit was another step in our planned energy transformation to focus on customer cost, carbon reduction and advancing clean energy solutions. With the retirement of Edgewater 4, we have now retired or converted approximately 50% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity.
A key part of our generation transformation includes adding efficient natural gas and renewable energy. In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 50% complete and is expected to go into service by the end of 2019. We are also advancing renewable energy with our proposed 150-megawatt Kossuth County wind project. We anticipate a decision on this wind resource in the first quarter of 2019. These 2 resource additions will replace the power from the Wisconsin coal facilities retired to-date and help advance clean energy for our Wisconsin customers.
Moving on to Iowa generation investments. We are making great progress in our plans to add 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. The new wind will be placed into service in 2 phases. The first phase totals 470 megawatts and will be in service during the first quarter of 2019. This phase has 2 projects: The 300-megawatt Upland Prairie project and the 170-megawatt English Farms project. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. The remaining 530 megawatts of wind is expected to be in play -- to be placed in service in 2020.
We believe our generation investments encourage economic development and job creation while meeting customer expectations for cleaner energy. We continue to work with state and local agencies to encourage further economic growth in our service territory. Last month, we celebrated as our Big Cedar Industrial Park became the first site in Iowa to received the mega site certification. This 1,300-acre site located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa has multimodal transportation options, including air, rail and highway access. In addition, Alliant Energy's nonregulated transportation division, AET, is developing a 75-acre logistics park adjacent to Big Cedar, offering a multitude of supply chain, transportation and logistic services. AET has also recently announced plans to acquire Hybrid Transit Systems, a freight management services company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Along with Big Cedar Industrial Park in Cedar Rapids, our company has also economic -- also has economic growth sites in Ames and Ottumwa, Iowa and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,588446808,1595585,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer",915,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.
Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer temperatures and higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 5 and 6.
For the first 9 months of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.09 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at -- or sorry, WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin retail customers. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance base is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As Pat mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's interim rates, following our anticipated retail electric rate filing early next year. We are forecasting IPL's interim electric base rate will go into effect in the second quarter of 2019.
The 2019 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2018. We are forecasting most of this sales growth from commercial and industrial customers in our Wisconsin service territory.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 10% for 2018 and 9% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. We are currently delivering the 2018 savings from Federal Tax Reform to our customers in both Iowa and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, we will also hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service in late 2019.
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. We have recently renegotiated to reduce transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency spend beginning in 2019 and, earlier this month, FERC issued an order to lower the independent adder that our transmission service providers allowed, thereby reducing expenses for our customers. Last quarter, we also shared with you that we entered an agreement to shorten the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra and add 340 megawatts of new wind PPAs, which will begin saving our customers money in 2021. Lastly, as we bring our planned wind projects into service, lower fuel expenses and production tax credits for our Iowa customers will largely offset the impacts of increases in renewables rate base.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 9. We have completed our key financings for 2018 with the issuance of a $500 million Green Bond at IPL in September to finance wind and solar generation projects in Iowa. As we look to 2019, our financing plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. This 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 10. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion programs and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 Federal Tax Reform benefits with billing credits. Also, since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the DAEC PPA docket and the IPL test year 2017 retail gas rate review. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and November 2018 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2022 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

That was based on the FERC decision that came out in the third quarter and so that's why we revised the capital expenditure guidance. The vast majority though of the rest of the difference there is just moving the dollars around between years just based on finalizing the expected timing of the in-service dates for the various different wind projects. As John indicated in his presentation, we've got about 470 megawatts that we're expecting to get into service in the first quarter of 2019 and the remaining 530 megawatts for Iowa sometime in the 2020 time frame, so just finalizing those timing moved around the CapEx dollars a little bit."

I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature.
Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the sixth year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later in the call.
Now, let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.
We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan totaling $7 billion as shown on Slide 3. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4.
Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020 is driven mostly by several anticipated gas expansion projects in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade at the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and therefore reduce CapEx for these projects.
In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 through 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making a 10-year plan total of $12.7 billion. Over 1/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investments in our electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardize voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We are also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing.
And speaking of our communities, Mother Nature was kind to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Several of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after an EF-3 tornado caused catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of homes and businesses suffered major damage during the severe floods that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and it has taken an incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generously assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance.
And last month, we filed a settlement with the Iowa Utilities Board regarding our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. As we shared with you last quarter, beginning in 2021, our customers will save approximately $60 million annually. This agreement also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, which will increase our wind energy in Iowa. With this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. The agreement includes recovery of a onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra in 2020, including earning return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We have not included this payment in our capital expenditure plan since it would be recorded as a regulatory asset. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board decision on this settlement agreement before year-end.
Before I conclude my remarks, I do want to comment on the midterm elections. First, they are over and we can all go back to watching TV and answering the phones. I would also assume that your recycle mail pile will now be much smaller. But seriously, we work hard to have good relationships with all elected officials, community leaders, regulators and customers no matter what party is in the lead. We look forward to working with Iowa Governor Reynolds and Wisconsin Governor-elect Evers. We will continue to support policies that serve our customers and our company well.
And with Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 powered veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. And a special happy birthday shout-out to the U.S. Marine Corps. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments so far this year and look forward to achieving our goals for 2019. Our team will continue focusing on the following: Complete our large construction projects on time and at/or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advance cleaner energy through additional fossil plant retirements, construction of West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

As Pat mentioned, we experienced warmer than normal temperatures in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. The year-to-date capacity factors at our combined cycle gas facilities have been over 55%. Efficient and responsive gas generation is a great market participant as well as a great complement for existing and future wind resources.
We continue to make great progress on our generation transformation. At the end of September, Unit 4 at our Edgewater generating station was retired. This unit was a 351-megawatt coal-fired generator, which was placed in service in 1969. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the dedicated employees who operated and maintained this unit, providing nearly 50 years of reliable power for our Wisconsin customers. Retiring this unit was another step in our planned energy transformation to focus on customer cost, carbon reduction and advancing clean energy solutions. With the retirement of Edgewater 4, we have now retired or converted approximately 50% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity.
A key part of our generation transformation includes adding efficient natural gas and renewable energy. In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 50% complete and is expected to go into service by the end of 2019. We are also advancing renewable energy with our proposed 150-megawatt Kossuth County wind project. We anticipate a decision on this wind resource in the first quarter of 2019. These 2 resource additions will replace the power from the Wisconsin coal facilities retired to-date and help advance clean energy for our Wisconsin customers.
Moving on to Iowa generation investments. We are making great progress in our plans to add 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. The new wind will be placed into service in 2 phases. The first phase totals 470 megawatts and will be in service during the first quarter of 2019. This phase has 2 projects: the 300-megawatt Upland Prairie project and the 170-megawatt English Farms project. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. The remaining 530 megawatts of wind is expected to be in play -- to be placed in service in 2020.
We believe our generation investments encourage economic development and job creation while meeting customer expectations for cleaner energy. We continue to work with state and local agencies to encourage further economic growth in our service territory. Last month, we celebrated as our Big Cedar Industrial Park became the first site in Iowa to receive the mega site certification. This 1,300-acre site located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa has multimodal transportation options, including air, rail and highway access. In addition, Alliant Energy's nonregulated transportation division, AET, is developing a 75-acre logistics park adjacent to Big Cedar, offering a multitude of supply chain, transportation and logistic services. AET has also recently announced plans to acquire Hybrid Transit Systems, a freight management services company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Along with Big Cedar Industrial Park in Cedar Rapids, our company has also economic -- also has economic growth sites in Ames and Ottumwa, Iowa and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,588446808,1595949,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer",915,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.
Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer temperatures and higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 5 and 6.
For the first 9 months of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.09 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at -- or sorry, WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin retail customers. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance base is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As Pat mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share. A walk from the midpoint to the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's interim rates, following our anticipated retail electric rate filing early next year. We are forecasting IPL's interim electric base rate will go into effect in the second quarter of 2019.
The 2019 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2018. We are forecasting most of this sales growth from commercial and industrial customers in our Wisconsin service territory.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 10% for 2018 and 9% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. We are currently delivering the 2018 savings from Federal Tax Reform to our customers in both Iowa and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, we will also hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service in late 2019.
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. We have recently renegotiated to reduce transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency spend beginning in 2019 and, earlier this month, FERC issued an order to lower the independent adder that our transmission service providers allowed, thereby reducing expenses for our customers. Last quarter, we also shared with you that we entered an agreement to shorten the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra and add 340 megawatts of new wind PPAs, which will begin saving our customers money in 2021. Lastly, as we bring our planned wind projects into service, lower fuel expenses and production tax credits for our Iowa customers will largely offset the impacts of increases in renewables rate base.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 9. We have completed our key financings for 2018 with the issuance of a $500 million Green Bond at IPL in September to finance wind and solar generation projects in Iowa. As we look to 2019, our financing plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. This 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 10. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion programs and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 Federal Tax Reform benefits with billing credits. Also, since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the DAEC PPA docket and the IPL test year 2017 retail gas rate review. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and November 2018 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2022 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.

The vast majority though of the rest of the difference there is just moving the dollars around between years just based on finalizing the expected timing of the in-service dates for the various different wind projects. As John indicated in his presentation, we've got about 470 megawatts that we're expecting to get into service in the first quarter 2019 and the remaining 530 megawatts for Iowa sometime in the 2020 time frame, so just finalizing those timing moved around the CapEx dollars a little bit."

I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature.
Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the sixth year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later in the call.
Now, let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.
We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan totaling $7 billion as shown on Slide 3. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4.
Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020 is driven mostly by several anticipated gas expansion projects in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade at the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and therefore reduce CapEx for these projects.
In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 through 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making a 10-year plan total of $12.7 billion. Over 1/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investments in our electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardize voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We are also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing.
And speaking of our communities, Mother Nature was kind to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Several of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after an EF-3 tornado caused catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of homes and businesses suffered major damage during the severe floods that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and it has taken an incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generously assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance.
And last month, we filed a settlement with the Iowa Utilities Board regarding our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. As we shared with you last quarter, beginning in 2021, our customers will save approximately $60 million annually. This agreement also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, which will increase our wind energy in Iowa. With this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. The agreement includes recovery of a onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra in 2020, including earning return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We have not included this payment in our capital expenditure plan since it would be recorded as a regulatory asset. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board decision on this settlement agreement before year-end.
Before I conclude my remarks, I do want to comment on the midterm elections. First, they are over and we can all go back to watching TV and answering the phones. I would also assume that your recycle mail pile will now be much smaller. But seriously, we work hard to have good relationships with all elected officials, community leaders, regulators and customers no matter what party is in the lead. We look forward to working with Iowa Governor Reynolds and Wisconsin Governor-elect Evers. We will continue to support policies that serve our customers and our company well.
And with Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 powered veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. And a special happy birthday shout-out to the U.S. Marine Corps. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments so far this year and look forward to achieving our goals for 2019. Our team will continue focusing on the following: Complete our large construction projects on time and at/or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advance cleaner energy through additional fossil plant retirements, construction of West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With that, I turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

As Pat mentioned, we experienced warmer than normal temperatures in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. The year-to-date capacity factors at our combined cycle gas facilities have been over 55%. Efficient and responsive gas generation is a great market participant as well as a great complement for existing and future wind resources.
We continue to make great progress on our generation transformation. At the end of September, Unit 4 at our Edgewater generating station was retired. This unit was a 351-megawatt coal-fired generator, which was placed in service in 1969. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the dedicated employees who operated and maintained this unit, providing nearly 50 years of reliable power for our Wisconsin customers. Retiring this unit was another step in our planned energy transformation to focus on customer cost, carbon reduction and advancing clean energy solutions. With the retirement of Edgewater 4, we have now retired or converted approximately 50% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity.
A key part of our generation transformation includes adding efficient natural gas and renewable energy. In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 50% complete and is expected to go into service by the end of 2019. We are also advancing renewable energy with our proposed 150-megawatt Kossuth County wind project. We anticipate a decision on this wind resource in the first quarter of 2019. These 2 resource additions will replace the power from the Wisconsin coal facilities retired to-date and help advance clean energy for our Wisconsin customers.
Moving on to Iowa generation investments. We are making great progress in our plans to add 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. The new wind will be placed into service in 2 phases. The first phase totals 470 megawatts and will be in service during the first quarter of 2019. This phase has 2 projects: the 300-megawatt Upland Prairie project and the 170-megawatt English Farms project. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. The remaining 530 megawatts of wind is expected to be in play -- to be placed in service in 2020.
We believe our generation investments encourage economic development and job creation while meeting customer expectations for cleaner energy. We continue to work with state and local agencies to encourage further economic growth in our service territory. Last month, we celebrated as our Big Cedar Industrial Park became the first site in Iowa to receive the mega site certification. This 1,300-acre site located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa has multimodal transportation options, including air, rail and highway access. In addition, Alliant Energy's nonregulated transportation division, AET, is developing a 75-acre logistics park adjacent to Big Cedar, offering a multitude of supply chain, transportation and logistic services. AET has also recently announced plans to acquire Hybrid Transit Systems, a freight management services company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Along with Big Cedar Industrial Park in Cedar Rapids, our company has also economic -- also has economic growth sites in Ames and Ottumwa, Iowa and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.

Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer temperatures and higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 5 and 6.
For the first 9 months of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.09 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at -- or sorry, WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin retail customers. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance base is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As Pat mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share. A walk from the midpoint to the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's interim rates, following our anticipated retail electric rate filing early next year. We are forecasting IPL's interim electric base rate will go into effect in the second quarter of 2019.
The 2019 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2018. We are forecasting most of this sales growth from commercial and industrial customers in our Wisconsin service territory.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 10% for 2018 and 9% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. We are currently delivering the 2018 savings from Federal Tax Reform to our customers in both Iowa and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, we will also hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service in late 2019.
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. We have recently renegotiated to reduce transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency spend beginning in 2019 and, earlier this month, FERC issued an order to lower the independent adder that our transmission service providers allowed, thereby reducing expenses for our customers. Last quarter, we also shared with you that we entered an agreement to shorten the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra and add 340 megawatts of new wind PPAs, which will begin saving our customers money in 2021. Lastly, as we bring our planned wind projects into service, lower fuel expenses and production tax credits for our Iowa customers will largely offset the impacts of increases in renewables rate base.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 9. We have completed our key financings for 2018 with the issuance of a $500 million Green Bond at IPL in September to finance wind and solar generation projects in Iowa. As we look to 2019, our financing plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. This 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 10. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion programs and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 Federal Tax Reform benefits with billing credits. Also, since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the DAEC PPA docket and the IPL test year 2017 retail gas rate review. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and November 2018 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2022 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So Julien, yes, right now, as you indicated, we've got a settlement agreement for the gas portion of the business in Iowa that we're awaiting the Iowa Utility Board decision on. We're pretty optimistic that they'll approve that settlement given it's a unanimous settlement. And in that, it had a 51% common equity layer. We will be pursuing a similar layer for common equity with the IPL electric case, which will be filed most likely sometime in the first quarter of 2019. And we'll likely get a decision, hopefully, by the end of 2019 or early 2020.
As far as the amount of additional equity needed to finance that, if we raised the common equity ratio by a couple hundred basis points, it's probably close to $50 million of additional equity that we'll need to be able to finance that."

Really, probably 2 primary things I'd point out there. One is additional interest expense. As a reminder, we went through and refinanced several different debt issuances on our nonutility side of the business in 2018 and that is going to require additional interest expense in 2019 once we get the full year impact of that. And then we also saw some additional tax benefits in the first quarter of 2018 related to our Great Western wind project that we won't see in 2019. But generally speaking, all the other businesses are performing as expected and pretty consistent with 2018."

That was based on the FERC decision that came out in the third quarter and so that's why we revised the capital expenditure guidance. The vast majority though of the rest of the difference there is just moving the dollars around between years just based on finalizing the expected timing of the in-service dates for the various different wind projects. As John indicated in his presentation, we've got about 470 megawatts that we're expecting to get into service in the first quarter 2019 and the remaining 530 megawatts for Iowa sometime in the 2020 time frame, so just finalizing those timing moved around the CapEx dollars a little bit."

So right now, the plan would be to file a test year 2018 historical filing with all of the rate base additions up through the end of the first quarter and that would incur or include all of the rate base additions for really the first half of the wind expansion programs, so think of that as the 470 megawatts of wind projects that we're expecting to put into service in the first quarter of 2019. Concurrently with that filing, we would filing -- be filing a forward-looking test period of either 1 or 2 years. It will either include 2020 and/or 2021. And that second one would likely include the 530 megawatts of wind projects that we're proposing to put into service in 2020.
Those are, by far, the biggest drivers for the 2 portions of the cases there, but think of those as probably being filed concurrently. We're still finalizing some of the rules as it relates to the forward-looking test periods in Iowa, given that's just a recent legislative change that happened in May. But that's, generally speaking, what we're planning right now."
