Good afternoon. We appreciate joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the high",1232,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.
2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the highest on the bank's 175-year history. In April, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp, which further strengthened our presence in the New York Metro area. In August, we also successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, which diversified over national equipment finance portfolio into the small-ticket leasing segment. We celebrated our franchise's 175th anniversary with a variety of volunteer and charitable activities, highlighted by a $175,000 donation to our Junior Achievement, our community foundation, single largest one-time grant ever; and we were once again recognized for our exceptional service by Greenwich Associates, who honored People's United with 8 awards, including a national best brand award in middle-market banking for ease of doing business.
We were very pleased with our strong financial performance for the year. We benefited from $138 million increase in revenues versus the prior year to $1.5 billion, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. These increase was due to improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. In addition, results were highlighted by an 18 basis point improvement in net interest margin to 2.98%, the strongest level in 3 years and the first year-over-year increase since 2011. During the year, we continued to make revenue-producing investments across our franchise. Such investments include further building out commercial lending capabilities in the health care vertical and SBA lending, as well as strengthening fee income generating infrastructure by improvement our loan syndications capabilities and international services. We also implemented a leading edge customer relationship management system, which has began to enhance the company's sales processes and increase referral and prospecting activity. We also continued to thoughtfully manage these expenses. From an operative perspective, expenses of $930 million were up $66 million from a year ago, and were at the low end of over midyear guidance. We are pleased with these results, given the inclusion of Suffolk and LEAF into the franchise during the year, and having Gerstein Fisher on the books for a full 12 months.
Loans ended the year at $32.6 billion, up $2.8 billion or 10% from 2016, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. This increase was driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. Excluding Suffolk and LEAF balances, loans grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid production in residential mortgages, equipment financing as well as middle-market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance and impact of over diversified business mix. Commercial real estate balances were unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, higher payout activity, a competitive environment and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. From our perspective, some of our privately held owner-operator clients have tended to be net sellers in this environment.
Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $3.2 billion or 11% from the prior year, driven by continued success gathering organic deposits as well as the addition of Suffolk's attractive deposit base. As a result, noninterest-bearing deposits now comprised 24% of total deposits, up from 22% a year ago. Finally, wealth management discretionary assets under management reached $9 billion after achieving 14% growth during the year due primarily to the new client inflows and strong market performance.
Moving to Slide 3. We have included a scorecard of our 2017 goals, which were updated midyear compared to actual results. We were in line with all of our goals with the exception of loan and deposit growth. As we guided on our October call, attaining the full year loan growth goal would be challenging in light of the market conditions as previously described within the commercial real estate, our largest portfolio. These market conditions continued during the fourth quarter and unfavorably impacted growth. 
Before discussing the year ahead,  I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress that we have made in improving leverage and enhancing profitability in recent years. Slide 4 through 6 illustrate this progress over the last 5 years, as evidenced by an improvement of 350 basis points in the efficiency ratio to 57.7%; 44% growth in earnings per common share to $1.04; and a 360 basis point increase in return on average tangible common equity over this period. As we continue to build earnings power of the company, we remain focused on further improving these metrics. Moving forward, we are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology-based offerings with our expert bankers to drive the unique client experience. We are confident revenue-producing investments, along with synergies created by recent acquisitions, will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders.
In addition, we remain very hopeful that the industry regulatory reform will occur this year. Based on my involvement in the midsized bank coalition and the meetings I have attended on this issue, of the $50 billion SIFI designation, it is front and center with many legislators in Washington, and there is a bipartisan effort to pass reform. We will continue to move toward our readiness to cross this threshold if legislation is not enacted, and remain confident in our ongoing preparations.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2018 as listed on Slide 7. The first goal was to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 4% to 6% on both a period-end and average-balance basis. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 3% to 5% range on both a period- end and average-balance basis. The next goal is for our net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation of net interest margin to be in the range of 3.05% to 3.15%. This net Interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 2 25 basis point rate increases in Fed funds during the year. In addition, the net interest margin range includes the unfavorable impacts of tax reform on our municipal bond and IFRB portfolios of approximately 5 basis points.
We expect noninterest income, on the operating basis, to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Operating noninterest expense for the year are anticipated to be in the range of $975 million to $995 million as compared to $930 million in 2017. This includes full year impact of the 2 acquisitions completed in 2017. We expect to maintain excellent credit quality, with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Finally, we also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that, at year-end, holding common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings of $104.5 million increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On",1237,"Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings of $104.5 million increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a common per share basis, operating earnings were $0.31, up $0.05 from the third quarter. These results benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate. It is important note the quarter included the following items, which were deemed nonoperating, given their nonreoccurring nature: security losses of $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to recently enacted tax reform; a tax benefit of $6.5 million resulting from a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities; and finally, merger-related expenses of $1.6 million pretax or $1.1 million after-tax.
Turning to Slide 9, net interest income of $292.3 million increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $7.1 million to the increase and net interest income due to higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Net interest income also benefited $4.3 million from higher yields and average balances in the securities portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit costs and volumes. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, which increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 3.07%. This expansion, as displayed on Slide 10, was driven by the loan portfolio which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis points, as new business yields remain higher than the total portfolio yield. A higher securities portfolio yield also increase the margin by 1 basis point, while higher deposit cost had an unfavorable impact of 4 basis points. Linked-quarter loan growth continued to highlight the impact and importance of our diversified business mix as shown on Slide 11. Period-end loans increased 2% annualized, driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle-market commercial and industrial lending. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances due to the reasons Jack outlined earlier in his remarks.
Mortgage warehouse lending balances ended the quarter at $1,045,000,000, a decrease of only $22 million from September 30. However, average balances for this business were down $107 million in the quarter. As such, while the total loan portfolio increased 4% annualized on an average balance basis, growth, excluding mortgage warehouse, was 5% annualized.
Turning to Slide 12. Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $509 million or 6% annualized for the quarter. The largest driver of this increase was higher noninterest-bearing balances of $347 million, primarily driven by our retail and municipal businesses. Deposits also benefited from a $218 million increase in time balances, due in part to a successful 2-year 1.75% CD offering, celebrating the company's 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, total deposits increase 10% annualized.
Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled $87.3 million. During the quarter, we sold approximately $290 million of 4-year-duration securities yielding 1.28% to take advantage of 2017's higher marginal tax rate. $150 million of sales proceeds has been reinvested in 2-year-duration securities, yielding approximately [ 1 90 ] and in the first quarter, we intend to further add securities to fully replace loss-carrying income.
As I referenced earlier, the $10 million pretax was $7.2 million after-tax loss as a result of these sales was deemed nonoperating, and was offset by a $6.5 million tax benefit associated with tax reform. On an operating basis, as displayed on Slide 13, noninterest income of $97.3 million increased 8% -- or $8 million or 9% from the third quarter. Higher noninterest income was primarily driven by a $3.3 million improvement in customer interest rate swap income as well as a $1.8 million increase in commercial banking lending fees, largely due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher operating lease income and investment management fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $2.8 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 14, we display the components driving the increase in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $1.6 million, with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, third quarter merger-related expenses were $3 million, of which $2.7 million were included in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses were $238.1 million, an increase of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. The largest driver of this result was a $1.8 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting higher incentive and health care costs. Expenses were also unfavorably impacted by a $1.6 million increase in regulatory assessments, resulting from higher average assets as well as a $1.2 million increase in professional and outside services. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio. As displayed on Slide 15, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.1%, which marks an improvement of 120 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and 320 basis points from a year ago. Going forward, even with the significant progress we have made, we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage to revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 16. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points is, once again, well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 8 basis points remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
As displayed on Slide 17, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 96 basis points and 13.8%, respectively. Both metrics increased for the second consecutive quarter, and were significantly higher than a year ago. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics over recent periods, and remain focused on executing our strategy to further enhance returns.
Continuing on to Slide 18. Capital ratios at the holding company ended the year either improved or unchanged from September 30. Capital levels remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix, a long history of exceptional risk management.
The final slide on Page 19 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. We remain asset-sensitive but slightly less so than at September 30. However, we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either 1-month LIBOR or time-based, consistent with both the previous quarter and the year ago.

So what we have done, it strengthens our ability to grow that business by strengthening the skill set and the resources of that we're focusing on. And we are bringing that unit together to focus on it. So we brought in some folks and a leader who had years of focusing in the health care vertical. And what we're going to do is leverage of all that to continue. And particularly in our footprint, health care is a big part of our economies across the Northeast and we want to do more in all of those areas. So not just hospitals but long-term care homes, facilities and other types of health care activities that service off and around all the health care needs of the people."

Really, hard to gauge what kind of impact that is. You've got someone that's in a home like that, has capacity and how that'll change their view about the desirability of an attractive property is hard to gauge right now. I would just go to -- when we talked about just in terms of what we are expecting in our portfolio and we think about that potential weakness, we've been originating loans with very conservative loan to values and very strong credit scores for a long, long, long time. The portfolio is very seasoned. So we don't have concerns about, hate, impact broadly, for sure. If there was be something, it would be very, very much on the margin, so to speak. So has the same concern, not sure -- I'd say they're saving on the home equity volume. Yes we -- the beauty of the home equity product is its flexibility, right? You want to go buy a car, or you want to pay a tuition bill, you write a check. You don't have to go apply for the next loan. So the structure of home equity to the consumer, I think, is going to remain very attractive. And I would be very surprised if that changes. I -- again, those it -- does it -- does the lack of predictability or interest changed the flow or growth of the portfolio? We are looking to see how that's all going to play out."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share,",1233,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.
2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the highest in the bank's 175-year history. In April, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp, which further strengthened our presence in the New York Metro area. In August, we also successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, which diversified our national equipment finance portfolio into the small-ticket leasing segment. We celebrated our franchise's 175th anniversary with a variety of volunteer and charitable activities, highlighted by a $175,000 donation to Junior Achievement, our community foundation single largest one-time grant ever; and we were once again recognized for our exceptional service by Greenwich Associates, who honored People's United with 8 awards, including a national best brand award in middle-market banking for ease of doing business.
We were very pleased with our strong financial performance for the year. Results benefited from $138 million increase in revenues versus the prior year to $1.5 billion, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. These increases -- this increase was due to improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. In addition, results were highlighted by an 18 basis point improvement in net interest margin to 2.98%, the strongest level in 3 years and the first year-over-year increase since 2011. 
During the year, we continued to make revenue-producing investments across our franchise. Such investments include further building out commercial lending capabilities in the health care vertical and SBA Lending, as well as strengthening fee income generating infrastructure by improving our loan syndications capabilities and international services. We also implemented a leading-edge customer relationship management system, which has begun to enhance the company's sales processes and increase referral and prospecting activity. We also continued to thoughtfully manage expenses. 
From an operating perspective, expenses of $930 million were up $66 million from a year ago, and were at the low end of our midyear guidance. We are pleased with these results, given the inclusion of Suffolk and LEAF into the franchise during the year, and having Gerstein Fisher on the books for a full 12 months.
Loans ended the year at $32.6 billion, up $2.8 billion or 10% from 2016, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. This increase was driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. Excluding Suffolk and LEAF balances, loans grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid production in residential mortgages, equipment financing as well as middle-market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance and impact of our diversified business mix. Commercial real estate balances were unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, higher payout activity, a competitive environment and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. From our perspective, some of our privately held owner-operator clients have tended to be net sellers in this environment. 
Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $3.2 billion or 11% from the prior year, driven by continued success gathering organic deposits as well as the addition of Suffolk's attractive deposit base. As a result, noninterest-bearing deposits now comprised 24% of total deposits, up from 22% a year ago. Finally, wealth management discretionary assets under management reached $9 billion after achieving 14% growth during the year, due primarily to the new client inflows and strong market performance.
Moving to Slide 3. We have included a scorecard of our 2017 goals, which were updated midyear compared to actual results. We were in line with all of our goals with the exception of loan and deposit growth. As we guided on our October call, attaining the full year loan growth goal would be challenging in light of the market conditions I previously described within the commercial real estate, our largest portfolio. These market conditions continued during the fourth quarter and unfavorably impacted growth. 
Before discussing the year ahead, I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress that we have made, improving operating leverage and enhancing profitability in recent years. Slide 4 through 6 illustrate this progress over the last 5 years, as evidenced by an improvement of 350 basis points in the efficiency ratio to 57.7%; 44% growth in earnings per common share to $1.04; and a 360 basis point increase in return on average tangible common equity over this period. As we continue to build earnings power of the company, we remain focused on further improving these metrics. 
Moving forward, we are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology-based offerings with our expert bankers to drive a unique client experience. We're confident revenue-producing investments, along with synergies created by the recent acquisitions, will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders.
In addition, we remain very hopeful that the industry regulatory reform will occur this year. Based on my involvement in the midsize bank coalition and the meetings I have attended on the issue, of the $50 billion SIFI designation, it is front and center with many legislators in Washington, and there is a bipartisan effort to pass reform. We will continue to move toward our readiness to cross this threshold if legislation is not enacted, and remain confident in our ongoing preparations.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2018 as listed on Slide 7. The first goal was to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 4% to 6% on both a period-end and average-balance basis. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 3% to 5% range on both a period-end and average-balance basis. The next goal is for our net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation of net interest margin to be in the range of 3.05% to 3.15%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 2 25 basis point rate increases in Fed funds during the year. In addition, the net interest margin range includes the unfavorable impacts of tax reform on our municipal bond and IRB portfolios of approximately 5 basis points.
We expect noninterest income, on the operating basis, to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Operating noninterest expense for the year are anticipated to be in the range of $975 million to $995 million as compared to $930 million in 2017. This includes full year impact of the 2 acquisitions completed in 2017. We expect to maintain excellent credit quality, with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Finally, we also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that, at year-end, holding company common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

It is important to note the quarter included the following items, which were deemed nonoperating, given their nonreoccurring nature: security losses of $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to recently enacted tax reform; a tax benefit of $6.5 million resulting from a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities; and finally, merger-related expenses of $1.6 million pretax or $1.1 million after-tax.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income of $292.3 million increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $7.1 million to the increase in net interest income due to the higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Net interest income also benefited $4.3 million from higher yields and average balances in the securities portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit costs and volumes. 
Results in the fourth quarter benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, which increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 3.07%. This expansion, as displayed on Slide 10, was driven by the loan portfolio which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. A higher securities portfolio yield also increase the margin by 1 basis point, while higher deposit cost had an unfavorable impact of 4 basis points. 
Linked-quarter loan growth continued to highlight the impact and importance of our diversified business mix as shown on Slide 11. Period-end loans increased 2% annualized, driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle-market commercial and industrial lending. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances due to the reasons Jack outlined earlier in his remarks.
Mortgage warehouse lending balances ended the quarter at $1,045,000,000, a decrease of only $22 million from September 30. However, average balances for this business were down $107 million in the quarter. As such, while the total loan portfolio increased 4% annualized on an average balance basis, growth, excluding mortgage warehouse, was 5% annualized.
Turning to Slide 12. Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $509 million or 6% annualized for the quarter. The largest driver of this increase was higher noninterest-bearing balances of $347 million, primarily driven by our retail and municipal businesses. Deposits also benefited from a $218 million increase in tight balances, due in part to a successful 2-year 1.75% CD offering, celebrating the company's 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, total deposits increase 10% annualized.
Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled $87.3 million. During the quarter, we sold approximately $290 million of 4-year-duration securities, yielding 1.28% to take advantage of 2017's higher marginal tax rate. $150 million of sales proceeds has been reinvested in 2-year-duration securities, yielding approximately 1.90% and in the first quarter, we intend to further add securities to fully replace loss-carry income.
As I referenced earlier, the $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax loss as a result of these sales was deemed nonoperating, and was offset by a $6.5 million tax benefit associated with tax reform. On an operating basis, as displayed on Slide 13, noninterest income of $97.3 million increased 8% -- or $8 million or 9% from the third quarter. Higher noninterest income was primarily driven by a $3.3 million improvement in customer interest rate swap income as well as a $1.8 million increase in commercial banking lending fees, largely due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher operating lease income and investment management fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $2.8 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 14, we display the components driving the increase in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $1.6 million, with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, third quarter merger-related expenses were $3 million, of which $2.7 million were included in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses were $238.1 million, an increase of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. The largest driver of this result was a $1.8 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting higher incentive and health care costs. Expenses were also unfavorably impacted by a $1.6 million increase in regulatory assessments, resulting from higher average assets as well as a $1.2 million increase in professional and outside services. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio. As displayed on Slide 15, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.1%, which marks an improvement of 120 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and 320 basis points from a year ago. Going forward, even with the significant progress we have made, we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 16. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points is, once again, well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 8 basis points remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
As displayed on Slide 17, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 96 basis points and 13.8%, respectively. Both metrics increased for the second consecutive quarter, and were significantly higher than a year ago. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics over recent periods, and remain focused on executing our strategy to further enhance returns.
Continuing on to Slide 18. Capital ratios at the holding company ended the year either improved or unchanged from September 30. Capital levels remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix, a long history of exceptional risk management.
The final slide on Page 19 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. We remain asset-sensitive, but slightly less so than at September 30. However, we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with both the previous quarter and the year ago.

So we've been talking about that, like a lot of people, I guess. And I would start by saying that, in that higher priced type of property, we do expect that there would be, at least, some additional softness as a result of the tax reform. Really, hard to gauge what kind of an impact that is. You've got someone that's in a home like that, has capacity and how that will change their view about our desirability of an attractive property. It's hard to gauge right now. I would just go to -- when we talked about it in terms of what we're expecting in our portfolio and we think about that potential weakness, we've been originating loans with very conservative loan to values and very strong credit scores for a long, long, long time. The portfolio is very seasoned. So we don't have concerns about any impact broadly, for sure. If there was something, it would be very, very much on the margin, so to speak. So has the same concern, not sure -- I'd say the same on home equity volume. We -- the beauty of a home equity product is its flexibility, right? You want to go buy a car, or you want to pay a tuition bill, you write a check. You don't have to go apply for the next loan. So the structure of home equity to the consumer, I think, is going to remain very attractive. And I would be very surprised if that changes. I -- again, does it -- does the lack of deductibility of the interest changed the flow or growth of the portfolio? We're looking to see how that's all going to play out."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share,",1230,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.
2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the highest in the bank's 175-year history. In April, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp, which further strengthened our presence in the New York Metro area. In August, we also successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, which diversified our national equipment finance portfolio into the small-ticket leasing segment. We celebrated our franchise's 175th anniversary with a variety of volunteer and charitable activities, highlighted by a $175,000 donation to Junior Achievement, our community foundation's single largest one-time grant ever; and we were once again recognized for our exceptional service by Greenwich Associates, who honored People's United with 8 awards, including a national best brand award in middle-market banking for ease of doing business.
We were very pleased with our strong financial performance for the year. Results benefited from $138 million increase in revenues versus the prior year to $1.5 billion, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. These increases -- this increase was due to improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. In addition, results were highlighted by an 18-basis point improvement in net interest margin to 2.98%, the strongest level in 3 years and the first year-over-year increase since 2011. 
During the year, we continued to make revenue-producing investments across our franchise. Such investments include further building out commercial lending capabilities in the health care vertical and SBA Lending, as well as strengthening fee income generating infrastructure by improving our loan syndications capabilities and international services. We also implemented a leading-edge customer relationship management system, which has begun to enhance the company's sales processes and increase referral and prospecting activity. We also continued to thoughtfully manage expenses. 
From an operating perspective, expenses of $930 million were up $66 million from a year ago, and we're at the low end of our midyear guidance. We are pleased with these results, given the inclusion of Suffolk and LEAF into the franchise during the year, and having Gerstein Fisher on the books for a full 12 months.
Loans ended the year at $32.6 billion, up $2.8 billion or 10% from 2016, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. This increase was driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. Excluding Suffolk and LEAF balances, loans grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid production in residential mortgages, equipment financing as well as middle-market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance and impact of our diversified business mix. Commercial real estate balances were unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, higher payoff activity, a competitive environment and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. From our perspective, some of our privately held owner-operator clients have tended to be net sellers in this environment. 
Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $3.2 billion or 11% from the prior year, driven by continued success gathering organic deposits as well as the addition of Suffolk's attractive deposit base. As a result, noninterest-bearing deposits now comprise 24% of total deposits, up from 22% a year ago. Finally, wealth management discretionary assets under management reached $9 billion after achieving 14% growth during the year, due primarily to new client inflows and strong market performance.
Moving to Slide 3. We have included a scorecard of our 2017 goals, which were updated midyear compared to actual results. We were in line with all of our goals with the exception of loan and deposit growth. As we guided on our October call, attaining the full year loan growth goal would be challenging in light of the market conditions I previously described within the commercial real estate, our largest portfolio. These market conditions continued during the fourth quarter and unfavorably impacted growth. 
Before discussing the year ahead, I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress that we have made, improving operating leverage and enhancing profitability in recent years. Slide 4 through 6 illustrate this progress over the last 5 years, as evidenced by an improvement of 350 basis points in the efficiency ratio to 57.7%; 44% growth in earnings per common share to $1.04; and a 360-basis point increase in return on average tangible common equity over this period. As we continue to build earnings power of the company, we remain focused on further improving these metrics. 
Moving forward, we are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology-based offerings with our expert bankers to drive a unique client experience. We're confident revenue-producing investments, along with synergies created by the recent acquisitions, will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders.
In addition, we remain very hopeful that the industry regulatory reform will occur this year. Based on my involvement in the midsize bank coalition and the meetings I have attended on the issue, of the $50 billion SIFI designation, it is front and center with many legislators in Washington, and there is a bipartisan effort to pass reform. We will continue to move toward our readiness to cross this threshold if legislation is not enacted, and remain confident in our ongoing preparations.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2018 as listed on Slide 7. The first goal was to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 4% to 6% on both a period-end and average-balance basis. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 3% to 5% range on both a period-end and average-balance basis. The next goal is for our net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation of net interest margin to be in the range of 3.05% to 3.15%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 2 25 basis point rate increases in Fed funds during the year. In addition, the net interest margin range includes the unfavorable impacts of tax reform on our municipal bond and IRB portfolios of approximately 5 basis points.
We expect noninterest income, on the operating basis, to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Operating noninterest expense for the year are anticipated to be in the range of $975 million to $995 million as compared to $930 million in 2017. This includes full year impact of the 2 acquisitions completed in 2017. We expect to maintain excellent credit quality, with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Finally, we also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that, at year-end, holding company common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."
295774,546630782,1371146,"People's United Financial, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings $104.5 million, increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a",1235,"Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings $104.5 million, increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a common per share basis, operating earnings were $0.31, up $0.05 from the third quarter. These results benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate. It is important to note the quarter included the following items, which were deemed nonoperating, given their nonreoccurring nature: security losses of $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to recently enacted tax reform; a tax benefit of $6.5 million resulting from a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities; and finally, merger-related expenses of $1.6 million pretax or $1.1 million after-tax.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income of $292.3 million increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $7.1 million to the increase in net interest income due to higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Net interest income also benefited $4.3 million from higher yields and average balances in the securities portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit costs and volumes. 
Results in the fourth quarter benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, which increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 3.07%. This expansion, as displayed on Slide 10, was driven by the loan portfolio which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. A higher securities portfolio yield also increased the margin by 1 basis point, while higher deposit costs had an unfavorable impact of 4 basis points. 
Linked-quarter loan growth continued to highlight the impact and importance of our diversified business mix as shown on Slide 11. Period-end loans increased 2% annualized, driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle-market commercial and industrial lending. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances due to the reasons Jack outlined earlier in his remarks.
Mortgage warehouse lending balances ended the quarter at $1,045,000,000, a decrease of only $22 million from September 30. However, average balances for this business were down $107 million in the quarter. As such, while the total loan portfolio increased 4% annualized on an average balance basis, growth, excluding mortgage warehouse, was 5% annualized.
Turning to Slide 12. Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $509 million or 6% annualized for the quarter. The largest driver of this increase was higher noninterest-bearing balances of $347 million, primarily driven by our retail and municipal businesses. Deposits also benefited from a $218 million increase in time balances, due in part to a successful 2-year 1.75% CD offering, celebrating the company's 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, total deposits increased 10% annualized.
Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled $87.3 million. During the quarter, we sold approximately $290 million of 4-year-duration securities, yielding 1.28% to take advantage of 2017's higher marginal tax rates. $150 million of sales proceeds has been reinvested in 2-year-duration securities, yielding approximately 1 90 and in the first quarter, we intend to further add securities to fully replace loss-carry income.
As I referenced earlier, the $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax loss as a result of these sales was deemed nonoperating, and was offset by a $6.5 million tax benefit associated with tax reform. On an operating basis, as displayed on Slide 13, noninterest income of $97.3 million increased 8% -- or $8 million or 9% from the third quarter. Higher noninterest income was primarily driven by a $3.3 million improvement in customer interest rate swap income as well as a $1.8 million increase in commercial banking lending fees, largely due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher operating lease income and investment management fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $2.8 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 14, we display the components driving the increase in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $1.6 million, with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, third quarter merger-related expenses were $3 million, of which $2.7 million were included in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses were $238.1 million, an increase of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. The largest driver of this result was a $1.8 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting higher incentive and health care costs. Expenses were also unfavorably impacted by a $1.6 million increase in regulatory assessments, resulting from higher average assets as well as a $1.2 million increase in professional and outside services. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvements in the efficiency ratio. As displayed on Slide 15, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.1%, which marks an improvement of 120 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and 320 basis points from a year ago. Going forward, even with the significant progress we have made, we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 16. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points is, once again, well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 8 basis points remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
As displayed on Slide 17, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 96 basis points and 13.8%, respectively. Both metrics increased for the second consecutive quarter, and were significantly higher than a year ago. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics over recent periods, and remain focused on executing our strategy to further enhance returns.
Continuing on to Slide 18. Capital ratios at the holding company ended the year either improved or unchanged from September 30. Capital levels remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix, a long history of exceptional risk management.
The final slide on Page 19 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. We remain asset-sensitive, but slightly less so than at September 30. However, we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with both the previous quarter and the year ago.

And so those expenses are part of our run rate now. And there would be some unusual things that would come in gradually, but we're not expecting anything unusual when and if we get there."

Really, hard to gauge what kind of an impact that is. You've got someone that's in a home like that, has capacity and how that will change their view about the desirability of an attractive property. It's hard to gauge right now. I would just go to -- when we talked about it in terms of what we're expecting in our portfolio and we think about that potential weakness, we've been originating loans with very conservative loan-to-values and very strong credit scores for a long, long time. The portfolios are very seasoned. So we don't have concerns about any impact broadly, for sure. If there was something, it would be very, very much on the margin, so to speak. So have the same concern, not sure -- I'd say the same on home equity volume. We -- the beauty of the home equity product is its flexibility, right? You want to go buy a car, or you want to pay a tuition bill, you write a check. You don't have to go apply for the next loan. So the structure of home equity to the consumer, I think, is going to remain very attractive. And I would be very surprised if that changes. I -- again, does it -- does the lack of deductibility of the interest change the flow or growth of the portfolio? We're looking to see how that's all going to play out."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share,",1232,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2.
2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the highest in the bank's 175-year history. In April, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp, which further strengthened our presence in the New York Metro area. In August, we also successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, which diversified our national equipment finance portfolio into the small-ticket leasing segment. We celebrated our franchise's 175th anniversary with a variety of volunteer and charitable activities, highlighted by a $175,000 donation to Junior Achievement, our community foundation's single largest one-time grant ever; and we were once again recognized for our exceptional service by Greenwich Associates, who honored People's United with 8 awards, including a national best brand award in middle-market banking for ease of doing business.
We were very pleased with our strong financial performance for the year. Results benefited from $138 million increase in revenues versus the prior year to $1.5 billion, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. These increases -- this increase was due to improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. In addition, results were highlighted by an 18 basis point improvement in net interest margin to 2.98%, the strongest level in 3 years and the first year-over-year increase since 2011. 
During the year, we continued to make revenue-producing investments across our franchise. Such investments include further building out commercial lending capabilities in the health care vertical and SBA Lending, as well as strengthening fee income generating infrastructure by improving our loan syndications capabilities and international services. We also implemented a leading-edge customer relationship management system, which has begun to enhance the company's sales processes and increase referral and prospecting activity. We also continued to thoughtfully manage expenses. 
From an operating perspective, expenses of $930 million were up $66 million from a year ago, and we're at the low end of our midyear guidance. We are pleased with these results, given the inclusion of Suffolk and LEAF into the franchise during the year, and having Gerstein Fisher on the books for a full 12 months.
Loans ended the year at $32.6 billion, up $2.8 billion or 10% from 2016, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. This increase was driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. Excluding Suffolk and LEAF balances, loans grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid production in residential mortgages, equipment financing as well as middle-market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance and impact of our diversified business mix. Commercial real estate balances were unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, higher payoff activity, a competitive environment and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. From our perspective, some of our privately held owner-operator clients have tended to be net sellers in this environment. 
Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $3.2 billion or 11% from the prior year, driven by continued success gathering organic deposits as well as the addition of Suffolk's attractive deposit base. As a result, noninterest-bearing deposits now comprise 24% of total deposits, up from 22% a year ago. Finally, wealth management discretionary assets under management reached $9 billion after achieving 14% growth during the year, due primarily to new client inflows and strong market performance.
Moving to Slide 3. We have included a scorecard of our 2017 goals, which were updated midyear compared to actual results. We were in line with all of our goals with the exception of loan and deposit growth. As we guided on our October call, attaining the full year loan growth goal would be challenging in light of the market conditions I previously described within the commercial real estate, our largest portfolio. These market conditions continued during the fourth quarter and unfavorably impacted growth. 
Before discussing the year ahead, I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress that we have made, improving operating leverage and enhancing profitability in recent years. Slide 4 through 6 illustrate this progress over the last 5 years, as evidenced by an improvement of 350 basis points in the efficiency ratio to 57.7%; 44% growth in earnings per common share to $1.04; and a 360 basis point increase in return on average tangible common equity over this period. As we continue to build earnings power of the company, we remain focused on further improving these metrics. 
Moving forward, we are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology-based offerings with our expert bankers to drive a unique client experience. We're confident revenue-producing investments, along with synergies created by the recent acquisitions, will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders.
In addition, we remain very hopeful that the industry regulatory reform will occur this year. Based on my involvement in the midsize bank coalition and the meetings I have attended on the issue, of the $50 billion SIFI designation, it is front and center with many legislators in Washington, and there is a bipartisan effort to pass reform. We will continue to move toward our readiness to cross this threshold if legislation is not enacted, and remain confident in our ongoing preparations.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2018 as listed on Slide 7. The first goal was to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 4% to 6% on both a period-end and average-balance basis. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 3% to 5% range on both a period-end and average-balance basis. The next goal is for our net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation of net interest margin to be in the range of 3.05% to 3.15%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 2 25 basis point rate increases in Fed funds during the year. In addition, the net interest margin range includes the unfavorable impacts of tax reform on our municipal bond and IRB portfolios of approximately 5 basis points.
We expect noninterest income, on the operating basis, to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Operating noninterest expense for the year are anticipated to be in the range of $975 million to $995 million as compared to $930 million in 2017. This includes full year impact of the 2 acquisitions completed in 2017. We expect to maintain excellent credit quality, with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Finally, we also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that, at year-end, holding company common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."
295774,546630782,1371532,"People's United Financial, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings $104.5 million, increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a",1237,"Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings $104.5 million, increased 17% on a linked-quarter basis, and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a common per share basis, operating earnings were $0.31, up $0.05 from the third quarter. These results benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate. It is important to note the quarter included the following items, which were deemed nonoperating, given their nonreoccurring nature: security losses of $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to recently enacted tax reform; a tax benefit of $6.5 million resulting from a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities; and finally, merger-related expenses of $1.6 million pretax or $1.1 million after-tax.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income of $292.3 million increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $7.1 million to the increase in net interest income due to higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Net interest income also benefited $4.3 million from higher yields and average balances in the securities portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit costs and volumes. 
Results in the fourth quarter benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, which increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 3.07%. This expansion, as displayed on Slide 10, was driven by the loan portfolio which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. A higher securities portfolio yield also increased the margin by 1 basis point, while higher deposit costs had an unfavorable impact of 4 basis points. 
Linked-quarter loan growth continued to highlight the impact and importance of our diversified business mix as shown on Slide 11. Period-end loans increased 2% annualized, driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle-market commercial and industrial lending. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances due to the reasons Jack outlined earlier in his remarks.
Mortgage warehouse lending balances ended the quarter at $1,045,000,000, a decrease of only $22 million from September 30. However, average balances for this business were down $107 million in the quarter. As such, while the total loan portfolio increased 4% annualized on an average balance basis, growth, excluding mortgage warehouse, was 5% annualized.
Turning to Slide 12. Period-end deposits of $33.1 billion were up $509 million or 6% annualized for the quarter. The largest driver of this increase was higher noninterest-bearing balances of $347 million, primarily driven by our retail and municipal businesses. Deposits also benefited from a $218 million increase in time balances, due in part to a successful 2-year 1.75% CD offering, celebrating the company's 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, total deposits increased 10% annualized.
Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled $87.3 million. During the quarter, we sold approximately $290 million of 4-year-duration securities, yielding 1.28% to take advantage of 2017's higher marginal tax rates. $150 million of sales proceeds has been reinvested in 2-year-duration securities, yielding approximately [ 1 90 ] and in the first quarter, we intend to further add securities to fully replace loss-carry income.
As I referenced earlier, the $10 million pretax or $7.2 million after-tax loss as a result of these sales was deemed nonoperating and was offset by a $6.5 million tax benefit associated with tax reform. On an operating basis, as displayed on Slide 13, noninterest income of $97.3 million increased 8% -- or $8 million or 9% from the third quarter. Higher noninterest income was primarily driven by a $3.3 million improvement in customer interest rate swap income as well as a $1.8 million increase in commercial banking lending fees, largely due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher operating lease income and investment management fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $2.8 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 14, we display the components driving the increase in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $1.6 million, with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, third quarter merger-related expenses were $3 million, of which $2.7 million were included in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses were $238.1 million, an increase of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. The largest driver of this result was a $1.8 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting higher incentive and health care costs. Expenses were also unfavorably impacted by a $1.6 million increase in regulatory assessments, resulting from higher average assets as well as a $1.2 million increase in professional and outside services. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvements in the efficiency ratio. As displayed on Slide 15, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.1%, which marks an improvement of 120 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and 320 basis points from a year ago. Going forward, even with the significant progress we have made, we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 16. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points is, once again, well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 8 basis points remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
As displayed on Slide 17, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 96 basis points and 13.8%, respectively. Both metrics increased for the second consecutive quarter and were significantly higher than a year ago. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics over recent periods, and remain focused on executing our strategy to further enhance returns.
Continuing on to Slide 18. Capital ratios at the holding company ended the year either improved or unchanged from September 30. Capital levels remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix, a long history of exceptional risk management.
The final slide on Page 19 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. We remain asset-sensitive, but slightly less so than at September 30. However, we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with both the previous quarter and the year ago.

It's hard to gauge right now. I would just go to -- when we talked about it in terms of what we're expecting in our portfolio and we think about that potential weakness, we've been originating loans with very conservative loan-to-values and very strong credit scores for a long, long time. The portfolios are very seasoned. So we don't have concerns about any impact broadly, for sure. If there was something, it would be very, very much on the margin, so to speak. So have the same concern, not sure -- I'd say the same on home equity volume. We -- the beauty of the home equity product is its flexibility, right? You want to go buy a car, or you want to pay a tuition bill, you write a check. You don't have to go apply for the next loan. So the structure of home equity to the consumer, I think, is going to remain very attractive. And I would be very surprised if that changes. I -- again, does it -- does the lack of deductibility of the interest change the flow or growth of the portfolio? We're looking to see how that's all going to play out."

Let's begin by turning to the first quarter overview on Slide 2. Our first quarter performance demonstrates our success and enhancing earnings power of the company, while continue to build the franchise for the long-term. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $107.9 million or $0.30 per common share and a return on average tangible common equity of 13.8%, an increase of 420 basis points from a year ago.
We continue to execute on revenue-producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions. As such, we're also pleased, total revenues of $386 million increased 2% from the fourth quarter and 16% from year-ago, driven by both higher net interest income and fee income.
Net interest margin was 3.05%, a 2 basis point decline from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preferenced items in our C&I portfolio, as well as 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and upward repricing of floating rate loans.
On a year-over-year comparison, net interest margin was up 23 basis points. While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling costs. The seasonality in expenses and the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenues were primarily -- the primary drivers of the increase in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.
Average loan balances were $32.1 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% linked quarter. 
While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period for loan growth, production was unfavorably impacted by customers remain cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff in the transactional  portion of our New multifamily portfolio. Despite the modest decline in the loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines at quarter-end, we remain confident the company can achieve the 2018 growth goal of [ 4% 6% ] that we announced in general. 
Moving on to deposits, average balances were $32.8 billion for the quarter, also a decline of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. We remain focused on gathering deposits across both our retail and business -- commercial businesses. 
As I discussed last quarter, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve clients. We're also investing in digital marketing capabilities with new tools and usage of data. We are aligning technology-based offerings with our expert bankers across business lines, including mobile and online capabilities, putting human interaction at the center. Therefore, we were's excited to launch our new retail checking campaign in February, which is deemed with the technology is as helpful as the people. The campaign is promoting quality of our customer service and the relevance, effectiveness and convenience of our technology.
Also, during the quarter, branch associates once again recognized People's United for its commitment to service with 5 excellence awards in middle-market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It's an honor to be recognized as it reflects the success of our unwavering commitment to service, the ability to offer a full suit of products and help clients achieve their financial goals.
Our solutions oriented approach to banking continues to differentiate People's United. 
Finally, our prudent capital management has enabled us to grow the business organically and invest strategically in the franchise, while also providing a consistent cash return capital to shareholders. As such, we are proud to announce the company's 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase. We remain committed to our strategy of annually increasing the common dividend, while also continuing to reduce our common dividend payout ratio by growing earnings.
It's important to note that the common dividend payout ratio was 56.3% for the first quarter, down from 78.3% a year ago.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

The largest offset to these increases was a $6.1 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit and borrowing costs. In addition, 2 fewer calendar days in the quarter lowered net interest income by $3.8 million.
As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of [ 3.05 ] was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preference items in the C&I portfolio, net interest margin increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin continued to benefit from the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points, as new business yields remain higher than the total portfolio yield. Conversely, 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter reduced the margin by 4 basis points, while higher deposit and borrowing costs collectively lowered the margin by another 6 basis points.
In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield decreased the margin by 2 basis points.
Turning to loans on Slide 5. Average balances were $32.1 billion, down $175 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
Average balance growth of $120 million in equipment financing and $31 million in residential mortgage was offset by lower average balances of $168 million in commercial real estate, $114 million in C&I and $44 million in home equity and other consumer.
We continue to be very pleased with the addition of LEAF, as their average loan balance grew 8% from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Period end loans were also $32.1 billion, down $471 million or 1% linked quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, loan production during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolio. 
Commercial real estate balances were lower, primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Write off from the New York multifamily portfolio was $145 million in the first quarter, which was higher than our quarterly expectation, due to 1 relationship with 10 loans, totaling $54 million paying off earlier in the year than anticipated.
Average deposit balances for the first quarter were $32.8 billion, down $54 million or less than 1% linked quarter. 
As you can see on Slide 6, growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $121 million was offset by $175 million and lower average balances collectively across savings, noninterest bearing and time deposits. Period end deposits were $32.9 billion, down $162 million or less than 1% linked quarter, driven by $199 million decrease in time balances and a $64 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The declines were partially offset by growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $68 million as well as savings balances of $32 million.
Deposit costs were up 3 basis points for the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling deposit costs as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit data of 16% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 26% during the same period.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $90.4 million increased $3.1 million or 4% on a linked-quarter basis.
As you will recall, noninterest income in the fourth quarter included $10 million of net security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy, which were offset by a tax benefit associated with tax reform. Noninterest income in the first quarter benefited from $2.9 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Commercial banking lending fees were also up $1.8 million in the quarter, primarily driven by higher C&I loan prepayment fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $3.7 million decline in customer interest rates income, which had a very strong fourth quarter.
As a reminder, the other noninterest income line item in the fourth quarter benefited from a $2.6 million gain on the sale of 2 acquired loans as well as a $1.2 million gain from the sale of Suffolk's headquarters building in River head Long Island.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $243.5 million increased $3.8 million or 2% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter did not have any merger-related expenses, while the fourth quarter included $1.6 million of merger-related expenses with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $5.4 million in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $8.6 million in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting seasonally higher payroll and benefit-related costs. Additionally, professional and outside services were up $900,000 [ from ] the fourth quarter. The largest offsets to these increases was $2.8 million in lower amortization of core deposit intangibles, relating to certain acquisitions, which were fully amortized as of year-end 2017, resulting in approximately a $2.6 million lower quarterly expense in 2018.
This reduction was contemplated in our full year 2018 expense goal provided in January. 
Additionally, regulatory assessments were $1.3 million lower [ in ] the fourth quarter, due in part to a reduction in average assets.
Turning to Slide 9. The efficiency ratio of 59.4% increased 330 basis points from the fourth quarter, but was flat compared to a year ago. As Jack described in his remarks, the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully-tax equivalent revenues were the primary reasons for the efficiency ratios increase from the fourth quarter. Tax reform added approximately 90 basis points to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter as a result of the lower FTE adjustment to net interest income, while seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs added approximately 150 basis points.
Looking forward, we remain committed to enhancing operating leverage for revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 10.
Originated nonperforming assets once -- as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 58 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points improved 2 basis points from an already low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to slide 11. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return-on-average assets of 98 basis points improved 28 basis points from a year ago, while return on average tangible common equity of 13.8% increased 420 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. In addition, capital ratios were favorably impacted by approximately 11 basis points, due to the reclassification of $38 million from AOC I to retained earnings, representing the standard tax effects arising as a result of tax reform. 
The final slide on page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates, as approximately 43% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based.

And then, I think, the reality is, as we've seen in the industry, the loan growth has been soft. And so, you've got an environment where, I'd like to say, too much money chasing too few deals. So competitively, the opportunities are very -- are in situations that are very competitive, kind of, across the spectrum. And we are sticking to our underwriting discipline. And we're sticking to our something. We actually had a slightly improved spreads this quarter. And that was encouraging given the business that we did and the improvements.

On the origination side, we feel very good about the businesses. One of the first places that I go in my mind in terms of our opportunities is the diverse nature of our portfolio. And so you've got a lot of different really specialized, focused lending platforms. And they all have strength and they all have good people and they have an ability to grow. Obviously, real estate has been -- it's been a challenging period, and we continue to move through that. Again, we've got a lot of very good people in that business and a lot of very good customers. So we expect to keep moving forward."

Let's begin by turning to the first quarter overview on Slide 2. 
Our first quarter performance demonstrates our success and enhancing earnings power of the company, while continuing to build the franchise for the long-term. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $107.9 million or $0.30 per common share and a return on average tangible common equity of 13.8%, an increase of 420 basis points from a year ago.
We continued to execute on revenue-producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions. As such, we're also pleased, total revenues of $386 million increased 2% from the fourth quarter and 16% from a year ago, driven by both higher net interest income and fee income.
Net interest margin was 3.05%, a 2 basis point decline from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preferenced items in our C&I portfolio, as well as 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and upward repricing of floating rate loans.
On a year-over-year comparison, net interest margin was up 23 basis points. While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling cost. The seasonality in expenses and the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenues were primarily -- the primary drivers of the increase in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.
Average loan balances were $32.1 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% linked quarter. While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period for loan growth, production was also unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Despite the modest decline in the loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines at quarter-end, we remain confident the company can achieve the 2018 growth goal of 4% -- 6% that we announced in January. 
Moving on to deposits, average balances were $32.8 billion for the quarter, also a decline of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. We remain focused on gathering deposits across both our retail and business -- commercial businesses.
As I discussed last quarter, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve clients. We're also investing in digital marketing capabilities with new tools and usage of data. We are aligning technology-based offerings with our expert bankers across business lines, including mobile and online capabilities, putting human interaction at the center. Therefore, we were excited to launch our new retail checking campaign in February, which is deemed with the technology is as helpful as the people. The campaign is promoting quality of our customer service and the relevance, effectiveness and convenience of our technology.
Also, during the quarter, branch associates once again recognized People's United for its commitment to service with 5 excellence awards in middle-market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It's an honor to be recognized as it reflects the success of our unwavering commitment to service, the ability to offer a full suit of products and help clients achieve their financial goals.
Our solutions oriented approach to banking continues to differentiate People's United.
Finally, our prudent capital management has enabled us to grow the business organically and invest strategically in the franchise, while also providing a consistent cash return capital to shareholders. As such, we are proud to announce the company's 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase. We remain committed to our strategy of annually increasing the common dividend, while also continuing to reduce our common dividend payout ratio by growing earnings.
It's important to note that the common dividend payout ratio was 56.3% for the first quarter, down from 78.3% a year ago.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

Net interest income of $295.8 million increased $3.5 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the upward repricing of floating-rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $2.7 million from higher average balances in the securities portfolio. The largest offset to these increases was a $6.1 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit and borrowing costs. In addition, 2 fewer calendar days in the quarter lowered net interest income by $3.8 million.
As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of 3.05% was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preference items in the C&I portfolio, net interest margin increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin continued to benefit from the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. Conversely, 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter reduced the margin by 4 basis points, while higher deposit and borrowing costs collectively lowered the margin by another 6 basis points. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield decreased the margin by 2 basis points.
Turning to loans on Slide 5. Average balances were $32.1 billion, down $175 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
Average balance growth of $120 million in equipment financing and $31 million in residential mortgage was offset by lower average balances of $168 million in commercial real estate, $114 million in C&I and $44 million in home equity and other consumer.
We continue to be very pleased with the addition of LEAF, as their average loan balance grew 8% from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations.
Period-end loans were also $32.1 billion, down $471 million or 1% linked quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, loan production during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolio.
Commercial real estate balances were lower, primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Write off from the New York multifamily portfolio was $145 million in the first quarter, which was higher than our quarterly expectation, due to 1 relationship with 10 loans, totaling $54 million paying off earlier in the year than anticipated.
Average deposit balances for the first quarter were $32.8 billion, down $54 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
 
As you can see on Slide 6, growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $121 million was offset by $175 million and lower average balances collectively across savings, noninterest bearing and time deposits. Period-end deposits were $32.9 billion, down $163 million or less than 1% linked quarter, driven by $199 million decrease in time balances and a $64 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The declines were partially offset by growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $68 million as well as savings balances of $32 million.
Deposit costs were up 3 basis points for the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling deposit cost as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit data of 16% since the beginning of the current cycle of the increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield data is 26% during the same period.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $90.4 million increased $3.1 million or 4% on a linked-quarter basis.
As you will recall, noninterest income in the fourth quarter included $10 million of net security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy, which were offset by a tax benefit associated with tax reform. Noninterest income in the first quarter benefited from $2.9 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
Commercial banking lending fees were also up $1.8 million in the quarter, primarily driven by higher C&I loan prepayment fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $3.7 million decline in customer interest rate swap income, which had a very strong fourth quarter.
As a reminder, the other noninterest income line item in the fourth quarter benefited from a $2.6 million gain on the sale of 2 acquired loans as well as a $1.2 million gain from the sale of Suffolk's headquarters building in Riverhead, Long Island.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $243.5 million increased $3.8 million or 2% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter did not have any merger-related expenses, while the fourth quarter included $1.6 million of merger-related expenses with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $5.4 million during the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $8.6 million in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting seasonally higher payroll and benefit-related costs. Additionally, professional and outside services were up $900,000 from the fourth quarter. The largest offsets to these increases was $2.8 million in lower amortization of core deposit intangibles, relating to certain acquisitions, which were fully amortized as of year-end 2017, resulting in approximately a $2.6 million lower quarterly expense in 2018.
This reduction was contemplated in our full year 2018 expense goal provided in January.
Additionally, regulatory assessments were $1.3 million lower in the fourth quarter, due in part to a reduction in average assets.
Turning to Slide 9. The efficiency ratio of 59.4% increased 330 basis points from the fourth quarter, but was flat compared to a year ago. As Jack described in his remarks, the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully-tax equivalent revenues were the primary reasons, the efficiency ratios increased from the fourth quarter. Tax reform added approximately 90 basis points to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter as a result of a lower [ FGE ] adjustment to net interest income, while seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs added approximately 150 basis points.
Looking forward, we remain committed to enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 10.
Originated nonperforming assets once -- as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 58 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points improved 2 basis points from an already low level and continued to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to slide 11. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return-on-average assets of 98 basis points improved 28 basis points from a year ago, while return on average tangible common equity of 13.8% increased 420 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. In addition, capital ratios were favorably impacted by approximately 11 basis points, due to the reclassification of $38 million from [ AOCI ] to retained earnings, represented -- representing the standard of tax effects arising as a result of tax reform.
The final slide on page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite arising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates, as approximately 43% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based.

And those are the kinds of things, Mark, where we would continue to work on given that regardless of SIFI designation, kind of, where a $44 billion bank, we're going to be a $54 billion bank. We need to have very solid governance and control around our data. So there's a lot of different components. I've mentioned in the past, where we kind of understand the living will. We're not spending any time or money or building one. We know it's not appropriate and it will be a waste of resource, so we avoid those kinds of things. So I would think -- I think the way for everyone to think about it is, there are many things that we have built to be prepared to cross $50 billion that are beneficial to the company and are in our run rate. And there are many things that we could avoid like a living will or the impact of the liquidity ratio, et cetera. And some of those things will be net benefits as we avoid them, but we wouldn't see an expense reduction in the sense of avoiding them. We just wouldn't have to incur it in the future."

So I would say that the, kind of, heightened competitive environment is coming in at multiple directions, but -- and we do see this typically in the first half of every year. For instance, in the commercial real estate area, that the insurance companies come back into the market, seems to be a little more activity with funds that are competing more deals. And then, I think, the reality is, as we've seen in the industry, the loan growth has been soft. And so, you've got an environment where, I'd like to say, too much money chasing too few deals. So competitively the opportunities are very -- are in situations that are very competitive, kind of, across the spectrum. And we are sticking to our underwriting discipline. And we're sticking to our -- I should say we actually had a slightly improved spreads this quarter. And that was encouraging given the business that we did and the improvements. But I think our biggest opportunity in terms of competing well, holding the line on pricing is all of our long-standing customer relationships. So it's when you have a good relationship banking business model and you've got customers that have been with the bank through 10, 15, 20 years. We obviously have an advantage competitively. They know us, they depend on our good solid execution and that helps them, kind of, plan and operate. And we can get appropriately rewarded for that."

Let's begin by turning to the first quarter overview on Slide 2. 
Our first quarter performance demonstrates our success in enhancing earnings power of the company, while continuing to build the franchise for the long-term. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $107.9 million or $0.30 per common share and a return on average tangible common equity of 13.8%, an increase of 420 basis points from a year ago.
We continued to execute on revenue-producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions. As such, we're also pleased, total revenues of $386 million increased 2% from the fourth quarter and 16% from a year ago, driven by both higher net interest income and fee income.
The net interest margin was 3.05%, a 2 basis point decline from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preferenced items in our C&I portfolio, as well as 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and upward repricing of floating rate loans.
On a year-over-year comparison, net interest margin was up 23 basis points. 
While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling cost. The seasonality in expenses and the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenues were primarily -- the primary drivers of the increase in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.
Average loan balances were $32.1 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% linked quarter. While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period for loan growth, production was also unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. 
Despite the modest decline in the loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines at quarter-end, we remain confident the company can achieve the 2018 growth goal of 4% -- 6% that we announced in January. 
Moving on to deposits, average balances were $32.8 billion for the quarter, also a decline of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. We remain focused on gathering deposits across both our retail and business -- commercial businesses.
As I discussed last quarter, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve clients. We're also investing in digital marketing capabilities with new tools and the usage of data. We are aligning technology-based offerings with our expert bankers across business lines, including mobile and online capabilities, putting human interaction at the center. 
Therefore, we were excited to launch our new retail checking campaign in February, which is themed, where the technology is as helpful as the people. The campaign is promoting quality of our customer service and the relevance, effectiveness and convenience of our technology.
Also, during the quarter, branch associates once again recognized People's United for its commitment to service with 5 excellence awards in middle-market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It's an honor to be recognized as it reflects the success of our unwavering commitment to service and the ability to offer a full suite of products that help clients achieve their financial goals.
Our solutions oriented approach to banking continues to differentiate People's United.
Finally, our prudent capital management has enabled us to grow the business organically and invest strategically in the franchise, while also providing a consistent cash return capital to shareholders. As such, we are proud to announce the company's 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase. We remain committed to our strategy of annually increasing the common dividend, while also continuing to reduce our common dividend payout ratio by growing earnings.
It's important to note that the common dividend payout ratio was 56.3% for the first quarter, down from 78.3% a year ago.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and",1327,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $295.8 million increased $3.5 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the upward repricing of floating-rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $2.7 million from higher average balances in the securities portfolio. 
The largest offset to these increases was a $6.1 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit and borrowing costs. In addition, 2 fewer calendar days in the quarter lowered net interest income by $3.8 million.
As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of 3.05% was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preference items in the C&I portfolio, net interest margin increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin continued to benefit from the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. Conversely, 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter reduced the margin by 4 basis points, while higher deposit and borrowing costs collectively lowered the margin by another 6 basis points. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield decreased the margin by 2 basis points.
Turning to loans on Slide 5. Average balances were $32.1 billion, down $175 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
Average balance growth of $120 million in equipment financing and $31 million in residential mortgage was offset by lower average balances of $168 million in commercial real estate, $114 million in C&I and $44 million in home equity and other consumer.
We continue to be very pleased with the addition of LEAF, as their average loan balance grew 8% from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations.
Period-end loans were also $32.1 billion, down $471 million or 1% linked quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, loan production during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower, primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Write off from the New York multifamily portfolio was $145 million in the first quarter, which was higher than our quarterly expectation, due to 1 relationship with 10 loans, totaling $54 million, paying off earlier in the year than anticipated.
Average deposit balances for the first quarter were $32.8 billion, down $54 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
 
As you can see on Slide 6, growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $121 million was offset by $175 million in lower average balances collectively across savings, noninterest bearing and time deposits. Period-end deposits were $32.9 billion, down $163 million or less than 1% linked quarter, driven by a $199 million decrease in time balances and a $64 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The declines were partially offset by growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $68 million as well as savings balances of $32 million.
Deposit costs were up 3 basis points for the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling deposit cost as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 16% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 26% during this same period.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $90.4 million increased $3.1 million or 4% on a linked-quarter basis.
As you will recall, noninterest income in the fourth quarter included $10 million of net security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy, which were offset by a tax benefit associated with tax reform. Noninterest income in the first quarter benefited from $2.9 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
Commercial banking lending fees were also up $1.8 million in the quarter, primarily driven by higher C&I loan prepayment fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $3.7 million decline in customer interest rate swap income, which had a very strong fourth quarter.
As a reminder, the other noninterest income line item in the fourth quarter benefited from a $2.6 million gain on the sale of 2 acquired loans as well as a $1.2 million gain from the sale of Suffolk's headquarters building in Riverhead, Long Island.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $243.5 million increased $3.8 million or 2% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter did not have any merger-related expenses, while the fourth quarter included $1.6 million of merger-related expenses with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $5.4 million during the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $8.6 million in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting seasonally higher payroll and benefit-related costs. Additionally, professional and outside services were up $900,000 from the fourth quarter. The largest offsets to these increases was $2.8 million in lower amortization of core deposit intangibles, relating to certain acquisitions, which were fully amortized as of year-end 2017, resulting in approximately a $2.6 million lower quarterly expense in 2018.
This reduction was contemplated in our full year 2018 expense goal provided in January.
Additionally, regulatory assessments were $1.3 million lower in the fourth quarter, due in part to a reduction in average assets.
Turning to Slide 9. The efficiency ratio of 59.4% increased 330 basis points from the fourth quarter, but was flat compared to a year ago. As Jack described in his remarks, the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully-tax equivalent revenues were the primary reasons the efficiency ratios increased from the fourth quarter. Tax reform added approximately 90 basis points to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter as a result of a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income, while seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs added approximately 150 basis points.
Looking forward, we remain committed to enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 10.
Originated nonperforming assets once -- as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 58 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points improved 2 basis points from an already low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to slide 11. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return-on-average assets of 98 basis points improved 28 basis points from a year ago, while return on average tangible common equity of 13.8% increased 420 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. In addition, capital ratios were favorably impacted by approximately 11 basis points, due to the reclassification of $38 million from AOCI to retained earnings, representing the stranded tax effects arising as a result of tax reform.
The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates, as approximately 43% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based.

We're not spending any time or money or building one. We know it's not appropriate and it would be a waste of resource, so we avoid those kinds of things.

So I would say the, kind of, heightened competitive environment is coming in at multiple directions, but -- and we do see this typically in the first half of every year. For instance, in the commercial real estate area, the insurance companies come back into the market, seems to be a little more activity with funds that are competing for deals. And then, I think, the reality is, as we've seen in the industry, the loan growth has been soft. And so, you've got an environment where, I like to say, too much money chasing too few deals. So competitively the opportunities are very -- are in situations that are very competitive, kind of, across the spectrum. And we are sticking to our underwriting discipline. And we're sticking to our -- I should say we actually had a slightly improved spread this quarter. And that was encouraging given the business that we did and the improvements. But I think our biggest opportunity in terms of competing well, holding the line on pricing is all of our long-standing customer relationships. So it's when you have a good relationship banking business model and you've got customers that have been with the bank 10, 15, 20 years, we obviously have an advantage competitively.

Let's begin by turning to the first quarter overview on Slide 2. 
Our first quarter performance demonstrates our success in enhancing earnings power of the company, while continuing to build the franchise for the long-term. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $107.9 million or $0.30 per common share and a return on average tangible common equity of 13.8%, an increase of 420 basis points from a year ago.
We continued to execute on revenue-producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions. As such, we're also pleased, total revenues of $386 million increased 2% from the fourth quarter and 16% from a year ago, driven by both higher net interest income and fee income.
The net interest margin was 3.05%, a 2 basis point decline from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preferenced items in our C&I portfolio, as well as 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and upward repricing of floating rate loans.
On a year-over-year comparison, net interest margin was up 23 basis points. 
While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling cost. The seasonality in expenses and the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenues were primarily -- the primary drivers of the increase in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.
Average loan balances were $32.1 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% linked quarter. While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period for loan growth, production was also unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. 
Despite the modest decline in the loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines at quarter-end, we remain confident the company can achieve the 2018 growth goal of 4% -- 6% that we announced in January. 
Moving on to deposits, average balances were $32.8 billion for the quarter, also a decline of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. We remain focused on gathering deposits across both our retail and business -- commercial businesses.
As I discussed last quarter, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve clients. We're also investing in digital marketing capabilities with new tools and the usage of data. We are aligning technology-based offerings with our expert bankers across business lines, including mobile and online capabilities, putting human interaction at the center. 
Therefore, we were excited to launch our new retail checking campaign in February, which is themed, where the technology is as helpful as the people. The campaign is promoting quality of our customer service and the relevance, effectiveness and convenience of our technology.
Also, during the quarter, branch associates once again recognized People's United for its commitment to service with 5 excellence awards in middle-market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It's an honor to be recognized as it reflects the success of our unwavering commitment to service and the ability to offer a full suite of products that help clients achieve their financial goals.
Our solutions oriented approach to banking continues to differentiate People's United.
Finally, our prudent capital management has enabled us to grow the business organically and invest strategically in the franchise, while also providing a consistent cash return capital to shareholders. As such, we are proud to announce the company's 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase. We remain committed to our strategy of annually increasing the common dividend, while also continuing to reduce our common dividend payout ratio by growing earnings.
It's important to note that the common dividend payout ratio was 56.3% for the first quarter, down from 78.3% a year ago.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $295.8 million increased $3.5 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis.

Net interest income of $295.8 million increased $3.5 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the upward repricing of floating-rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $2.7 million from higher average balances in the securities portfolio. 
The largest offset to these increases was a $6.1 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit and borrowing costs. In addition, 2 fewer calendar days in the quarter lowered net interest income by $3.8 million.
As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of 3.05% was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax preference items in the C&I portfolio, net interest margin increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin continued to benefit from the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. Conversely, 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter reduced the margin by 4 basis points, while higher deposit and borrowing costs collectively lowered the margin by another 6 basis points. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield decreased the margin by 2 basis points.
Turning to loans on Slide 5. Average balances were $32.1 billion, down $175 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
Average balance growth of $120 million in equipment financing and $31 million in residential mortgage was offset by lower average balances of $168 million in commercial real estate, $114 million in C&I and $44 million in home equity and other consumer.
We continue to be very pleased with the addition of LEAF, as their average loan balance grew 8% from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations.
Period-end loans were also $32.1 billion, down $471 million or 1% linked quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, loan production during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios.
Commercial real estate balances were lower, primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Write off from the New York multifamily portfolio was $145 million in the first quarter, which was higher than our quarterly expectation, due to 1 relationship with 10 loans, totaling $54 million, paying off earlier in the year than anticipated.
Average deposit balances for the first quarter were $32.8 billion, down $54 million or less than 1% linked quarter.
 
As you can see on Slide 6, growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $121 million was offset by $175 million in lower average balances collectively across savings, noninterest bearing and time deposits. Period-end deposits were $32.9 billion, down $163 million or less than 1% linked quarter, driven by a $199 million decrease in time balances and a $64 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The declines were partially offset by growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balances of $68 million as well as savings balances of $32 million.
Deposit costs were up 3 basis points for the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling deposit cost as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 16% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 26% during this same period.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $90.4 million increased $3.1 million or 4% on a linked-quarter basis.
As you will recall, noninterest income in the fourth quarter included $10 million of net security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy, which were offset by a tax benefit associated with tax reform. Noninterest income in the first quarter benefited from $2.9 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
Commercial banking lending fees were also up $1.8 million in the quarter, primarily driven by higher C&I loan prepayment fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $3.7 million decline in customer interest rate swap income, which had a very strong fourth quarter.
As a reminder, the other noninterest income line item in the fourth quarter benefited from a $2.6 million gain on the sale of 2 acquired loans as well as a $1.2 million gain from the sale of Suffolk's headquarters building in Riverhead, Long Island.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $243.5 million increased $3.8 million or 2% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter did not have any merger-related expenses, while the fourth quarter included $1.6 million of merger-related expenses with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $5.4 million during the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $8.6 million in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting seasonally higher payroll and benefit-related costs. Additionally, professional and outside services were up $900,000 from the fourth quarter. The largest offsets to these increases was $2.8 million in lower amortization of core deposit intangibles, relating to certain acquisitions, which were fully amortized as of year-end 2017, resulting in approximately a $2.6 million lower quarterly expense in 2018.
This reduction was contemplated in our full year 2018 expense goal provided in January.
Additionally, regulatory assessments were $1.3 million lower in the fourth quarter, due in part to a reduction in average assets.
Turning to Slide 9. The efficiency ratio of 59.4% increased 330 basis points from the fourth quarter, but was flat compared to a year ago. As Jack described in his remarks, the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully-tax equivalent revenues were the primary reasons the efficiency ratios increased from the fourth quarter. Tax reform added approximately 90 basis points to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter as a result of a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income, while seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs added approximately 150 basis points.
Looking forward, we remain committed to enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 10.
Originated nonperforming assets once -- as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 58 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points improved 2 basis points from an already low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to slide 11. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return-on-average assets of 98 basis points improved 28 basis points from a year ago, while return on average tangible common equity of 13.8% increased 420 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. In addition, capital ratios were favorably impacted by approximately 11 basis points, due to the reclassification of $38 million from AOCI to retained earnings, representing the stranded tax effects arising as a result of tax reform.
The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates, as approximately 43% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based.

Our expectation would be that if we do have the opportunity to acquire in the banking space it would most likely be a 100% stock deal. So in no way would we think that our capital levels would be an issue around any type of acquisition."

So I think we are very anxious, waiting on Washington, given our size and the benefits of the Crapo bill. Those that are smaller, it's less of an urgent issue. There's obviously some potential progress and relief in the proposal. So I would say, it feels pretty normal right now."

We need to have very solid governance and control around our data. So there's a lot of different components. I've mentioned in the past, where we kind of understand the living will. We're not spending any time or money or building one. We know it's not appropriate and it would be a waste of resource, so we avoid those kinds of things. So I would think -- I think the way for everyone to think about it is, there are many things that we have built to be prepared to cross $50 billion that are beneficial to the company and are in our run rate. And there are many things that we could avoid like a living will or the impact of the liquidity ratio, et cetera.

For instance, in the commercial real estate area, the insurance companies come back into the market, seems to be a little more activity with funds that are competing for deals. And then, I think, the reality is, as we've seen in the industry, the loan growth has been soft. And so, you've got an environment where, I like to say, too much money chasing too few deals. So competitively the opportunities are very -- are in situations that are very competitive, kind of, across the spectrum. And we are sticking to our underwriting discipline. And we're sticking to our -- I should say we actually had a slightly improved spread this quarter. And that was encouraging given the business that we did and the improvements. But I think our biggest opportunity in terms of competing well, holding the line on pricing is all of our long-standing customer relationships. So it's when you have a good relationship banking business model and you've got customers that have been with the bank 10, 15, 20 years, we obviously have an advantage competitively.

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's began by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of",1004,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Let's began by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $110.2 million or $0.31 per common share. These results reflect the continued benefits of investments and revenue-producing initiatives, sustained excellent asset quality and recent successful acquisitions. 
On an operating basis, earnings were $0.32 per common share, up $0.08 or 33% from a year ago, and operating return on average tangible common equity was 14.2%, an increase of 330 basis points over the same period. 
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated the second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
Total revenues of $396 million increased 3% as a result of growth in both net interest income, driven by net interest margin expansion and noninterest income. 
The margin improved 5 basis points and benefit from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost. 
Operating expenses of $246 million, which includes $4 million in costs related to branch closures increased only $2 million or 1%. 
Average loan balances were flat compared to the first quarter, while period end balances were up $408 million or 1%, reflecting stronger activity in June compared to the first 2 months of the quarter. 
Growth was driven by solid results in middle market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending. 
We [indiscernible] overall loan growth has been flat and below our expectations. These results are primarily attributed to continued headwinds in commercial real estate, which have cost balances in this portfolio to decline over $300 million or 6% annualized during the first half of 2018. 
As we've discussed previously, commercial real estate has been impacted by runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which has totaled $228 million year-to-date, heightened competition and above average payoffs. 
Since commercial real estate is our largest portfolio, these headwinds have reduced the rate of growth of the overall portfolio. 
Additionally, year-to-date loan growth has also been impacted by a decline of our $100 million in home equity balances or 10% annualized, which is consistent with overall industry results. 
A reduction in home equity balances was driven by lower originations and lower initial utilization rates. 
However, exclusive of commercial real estate home equity, we are experiencing strong results across many of our businesses that are in line with our expectations for the year. 
For example, middle market C&I has achieved a 5% annualized growth this year, while equipment financing is up 10% annualized. 
Looking forward, the strength of our diversified business mix, the solid period-end pipeline and continued benefits from resident -- revenue producing initiatives caused us to be optimistic that loan growth through the second half of the year will be meaningfully better than the first 6 months. 
Moving onto deposits. Balances were lower as a result of seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. 
However, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends. 
We did see a pickup in industry deposit cost during the second quarter. 
However, in our view the industry continues to behave rationally. While we will remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect share and client relationships, we will continue to be disciplined and not leave the market in pricing. 
Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of Vend Lease, a Baltimore based equipment finance company, established in 1979, that operates primarily in the hospitality industry. 
Then we share the client-centric approach has a highly specialized skills that and is a recognized brand in the market it serves. 
The company will become a division of lease commercial capital, enabling it to leverage at leased technology platform, marketing team and leading automation capabilities, creating greater efficiencies across sales and operational functions. 
Additionally, Vend Lease will also be able to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet and lower funding cost to further accelerate growth and enhanced profitability. 
We're excited about the transaction as the strength of our combined expertise will provide an exceptional experience for clients, even our network of specialty finance experts and bolster our nationwide businesses. 
Additionally, in June, we announced an agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp, a holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction continues the momentum generated from our recent acquisitions of Suffolk and LEAF as well as provide us with a classic in-market acquisition of a high quality franchise that further strengthens our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. 
The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach. 
As a result of the integration activities, we are even more excited about the transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. 
This transaction has low execution risk, given our significant knowledge with Farmington Bank and the history of successful integrations. We are confident that transaction will close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals. 
Finally, as many of you know, Jeff Tengel was promoted to President during the second quarter, and is leading the full complement of business lines at People's United. 
Jeff joined the company in 2010 from PNC Bank to lead the commercial division. 
Since that time, he has significantly expanded the commercial division and its product offerings with the addition of mortgage warehouse, large corporate banking, international services, healthcare and syndications. He has broaden and grown treasury management government banking, asset-based lending and the equipment finance businesses. 
He is also played an important role in integrating the numerous acquisitions completed over the last 8 years. As we continue to grow the company, we need to make sure our organizational structure supports the future trajectory of People's United. 
Jeff is uniquely qualified to help lead us through our future expansion. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the second quarter in more detail."

Turning to slide to 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to the net interest income due to higher yields on new bus",1495,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to slide to 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. 
The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to the net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. 
Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1.1 million from the prior yields in the securities portfolio. 
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.4 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. 
In addition, net interest income was unfavorably impacted by $4.8 million, resulting from an increase in borrowing costs. 
Net interest margin of 3.10% was 5 basis points higher than the first quarter. 
As displayed on Slide 4, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 13 basis points, as new business yields remain higher than the total portfolio yield for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day by -- while our higher yields the securities portfolio added the basis point. 
Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing cost lower the margin by 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. 
Looking at loans on Slide 5, average balances of $32.1 billion were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances of $32.5 billion were up $408 million or 1%. 
The growth was driven by solid results in middle market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending. 
The increase in equipment financing balances was driven by each of our equipment financing units, with particularly strong results coming from LEAF. 
In addition, the acquisition of Vend Lease, which closed at the end of June added $58 million to the LEAF portfolio. The mortgage warehouse lending portfolio rebounded in the second quarter as well as his ended the period at $1.1 billion, up $95 million than the end of the first quarter. 
Commercial real estate balances declined on both an average and period-end bases as the portfolio continued to be impacted by the factors Jack outlined earlier. 
However, excluding the write-off in the transactional portion of our New York multi family portfolio of $79 million, commercial real estate balances grew modestly from the end of the first quarter. 
We now expect the run off in our transactional New York multi family portfolio to be $350 million to $400 million for the full year, an increase from our expectation in January of $250 million to $300 million. 
Average deposit balances for the second quarter were $32.5 billion, down $288 million or 1% linked quarter, while period-end deposits were also $32.5 billion, down $426 million or 1%. 
The lower balances resulted from seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. 
On a period-end bases, municipal and retail balances declined approximately $500 million and $100 million, respectively for the quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends. 
Turning to Slide 6, which displays average deposits by product, you can see the $288 million reductions, while it was driven by a $268 million declined in interest-bearing checking and money market balances, and a $154 million decline in savings balances. 
The declines were partially offset by growth in noninterest bearing checking balances of $76 million and time balances of $58 million. 
While deposit costs were up 8 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 20% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. 
In comparison, our loan yield beta is 33% during the same period. 
Specifically, for the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 40%, while the loan yield beta was 76%. 
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income was $94.9 million, increased $4.5 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in noninterest income was driven primarily by higher customer interest rate swap income of $2.5 million as well as increases in bank service charges and cash management fees. 
The largest offsets to these improvements were $1.5 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial real estate -- commercial insurance renewables, which are lower in the second and fourth quarters of the year, and a $1 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees due to the lower loan prepayments. 
Included in other noninterest income this quarter was $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments. 
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $248.6 million increased $5.1 million or 2% from the first quarter. Included in the second quarter results were merger-related expenses of $2.9 million. 
$2.1 million of the merger-related expenses are in professional and outside services, while the remainder is in other noninterest expense. 
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $2.2 million or 1% from the first quarter. 
The primary drivers of this increase was $4.1 million in costs related to 10 branch closures, spread throughout the franchise as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channels. 
In addition, advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.6 million. Both branch closure and advertising and promotion costs are located in the other expense line in our earnings release. 
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits, driven by lower payroll related and benefit cost, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. 
We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio. 
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis as shown on Slide 9. 
On a year-over-year basis, the efficiency ratio is flat. 
However, as a reminder, beginning last quarter, the efficiency ratio includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in a lower FTE adjustment for net interest income. 
As demonstrated on Slide 10, asset quality continues to be exceptional. As a result of our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards. 
Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 62 basis points was up 4 basis points linked quarter, but improved 5 basis points from an already low level in the prior-year quarter. 
The modest increase from the end of the first quarter was driven by 2 unrelated C&I credits. 
This metric continues to be well below our peer group in top 50 banks. 
Net charge-offs of 6 basis points was unchanged in the most recent quarter, and continues to reflect the minimal loss contest or nonperforming assets. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We remain pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. 
Return on average assets of 1% and return on average tangible common equity of 13.9%, each improved compared to the prior-year quarter and first quarter. 
On an operating basis, return on average assets of 99 basis points increased 22 basis points from a year ago, and return on average tangible common equity of 14.2% was up 330 basis points over the same period. 
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics. 
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. 
Continuing to Slide 13. We display our interest rate risk profile with all payroll rate changes and yield curve twist. 
We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either 1 month LIBOR or prime based, up from 43% at the end of the first quarter and a year ago. 
Before opening the call up for questions, I wanted to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update for our full year 2018 goals. 
It is important to note these goals do not include First Connecticut but do incorporate the acquisition of Vend Lease. 
Our updated goals are as follows: Acknowledging the impact on first half 2018 loan growth from commercial real estate headwinds and industrywide slowdown in the home equity market, we expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 3% to 5%, a modest reduction to our original goal. 
Deposit growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%. 
Total expenses, excluding merger-related cost are now in the range of $975 million to $985 million. 
Finally, we have also lowered our division to a range of $25 million to $35 million. It is important to note that full year goals for net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged. 
In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year earnings expectations. 
Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

Our equipment finance businesses have all been showing good growth, and there are typically stronger in the second half of the year than they are in the first, anyway. So they're coming to the second half with some momentum that we find encouraging. And finally, the commercially real estate business, while they do have good pipeline. As Jack and David both referenced, it is -- the market is challenging. And I think as we talked in the past, a lot of our customers are -- what I would consider middle market real state customers, that are investing their own money. So there tends to be a little bit conservative. They're not firms, investing other people's money. And so, on balance, they're less active than maybe some of the recent funds in the market. But we are still supporting them, we're still very active with our customers.

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $",1000,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $110.2 million or $0.31 per common share. These results reflect the continued benefits of investments in revenue-producing initiatives, sustained excellent asset quality and recent successful acquisitions.
On an operating basis, earnings were $0.32 per common share, up $0.08 or 33% from a year ago, and operating return on average tangible common equity was 14.2%, an increase of 330 basis points over the same period.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated the second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis.
Total revenues of $396 million increased 3% as a result of growth in both net interest income, driven by net interest margin expansion and noninterest income.
The margin improved 5 basis points and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost.
Operating expenses of $246 million, which includes $4 million in costs related to branch closures increased only $2 million or 1%.
Average loan balances were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances were up $408 million or 1%, reflecting stronger activity in June compared to the first 2 months of the quarter.
Growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending.
Year-to-date overall loan growth has been flat and below our expectations. These results are primarily attributed to continued headwinds in commercial real estate, which have caused balances in this portfolio to decline over $300 million or 6% annualized during the first half of 2018.
As we have discussed previously, commercial real estate has been impacted by a runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which has totaled $228 million year-to-date, heightened competition and above average payoffs.
Since commercial real estate is our largest portfolio, these headwinds have reduced the rate of growth of the overall portfolio.
Additionally, year-to-date loan growth has also been impacted by a decline of over $100 million in home equity balances or 10% annualized, which is consistent with overall industry results. The reduction in home equity balances is driven by lower originations and lower initial utilization rates. 
However, exclusive of commercial real estate and home equity, we are experiencing strong results across many of our businesses that are in line with our expectations for the year.
For example, middle-market C&I has achieved 5% annualized growth this year, while equipment financing is up 10% annualized.
Looking forward, the strength of our diversified business mix, the solid period-end pipelines and continued benefits from revenue-producing initiatives caused us to be optimistic that loan growth in the second half of the year will be meaningfully better than the first 6 months.
Moving onto deposits. Balances were lower as a result of seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. However, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
We did see a pickup in industry deposit cost during the second quarter. However, in our view, the industry continues to behave rationally. While we will remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect share and client relationships, we will continue to be disciplined and not lead the market in pricing.
Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of Vend Lease, a Baltimore-based equipment finance company, established in 1979, that operates primarily in the hospitality industry.
Vend Lease shares our client-centric approach, has a highly specialized skill set and is a recognized brand in the market it serves. The company will become a division of lease commercial capital, enabling it to leverage leased technology platform, marketing team and leading automation capabilities, creating greater efficiencies across sales and operational functions.
Additionally, Vend Lease will also be able to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet and a lower funding cost to further accelerate growth and enhance profitability.
We are excited about the transaction as the strength of our combined expertise will provide an exceptional experience for clients, even our network of specialty finance experts and bolster our nationwide businesses.
Additionally, in June, we announced an agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp, a holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction continues the momentum generated from our recent acquisitions of Suffolk and LEAF as well as provides us with a classic in-market acquisition of a high-quality franchise that further strengthens our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach.
As a result of the integration activities, we are even more excited about the transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us.
This transaction has low execution risk, given our significant knowledge with Farmington Bank and the history of successful integrations. We are confident the transaction will close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
Finally, as many of you know, Jeff Tengel was promoted to President during the second quarter and is leading the full complement of business lines at People's United. Jeff joined the company in 2010 from PNC Bank to lead the commercial division.
Since that time, he has significantly expanded the commercial division and its product offerings with the addition of mortgage warehouse, large corporate banking, international services, health care and syndications. He has broadened and grown treasury management, government banking, asset-based lending and the equipment-financed businesses.
He has also played an important role in integrating the numerous acquisitions completed over the last 8 years. As we continue to grow as a company, we need to make sure our organizational structure supports the future trajectory of People's United.
Jeff is uniquely qualified to help lead us through our future expansion.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the second quarter in more detail."

Turning to slide 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business an",1485,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to slide 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.
The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1.1 million from higher yields in the securities portfolio.
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.4 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost.
In addition, net interest income was unfavorably impacted by $4.8 million, resulting from an increase in borrowing cost.
Net interest margin of 3.10% was 5 basis points higher than the first quarter.
As displayed on Slide 4, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 13 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day by -- while higher yields in the securities portfolio added 1 basis point. 
Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing cost lowered the margin by 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively.
Looking at loans on Slide 5, average balances of $32.1 billion were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances of $32.5 billion were up $408 million or 1%.
The growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending.
The increase in equipment financing balances was driven by each of our equipment financing units, with particularly strong results coming from LEAF.
In addition, the acquisition of Vend Lease, which closed at the end of June added $68 million to the LEAF portfolio. The mortgage warehouse lending portfolio rebounded in the second quarter as balances ended the period at $1.1 billion, up $95 million than the end of the first quarter.
Commercial real estate balances declined on both an average and period-end basis as the portfolio continued to be impacted by the factors Jack outlined earlier.
However, excluding the runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio of $79 million, commercial real estate balances grew modestly from the end of the first quarter.
We now expect the runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio to be $350 million to $400 million for the full year, an increase from our expectation in January of $250 million to $300 million.
Average deposit balances for the second quarter were $32.5 billion, down $288 million or 1% linked quarter, while period-end deposits were also $32.5 billion, down $426 million or 1%. The lower balance has resulted from seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses.
On a period-end basis, municipal and retail balances declined approximately $500 million and $100 million, respectively for the quarter.
Looking forward, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
Turning to Slide 6, which displays average deposits by product, you can see the $288 million reductions, while it was driven by a $268 million decline in interest-bearing checking and money market balances, and $154 million decline in savings balances.
The declines were partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing checking balances of $76 million and time balances of $58 million.
While deposit costs were up 8 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 20% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 33% during the same period.
Specifically, for the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 40%, while the loan yield beta was 76%.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $94.9 million increased $4.5 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in noninterest income was driven primarily by higher customer interest rate swap income of $2.5 million as well as increases in bank service charges and cash management fees.
The largest offsets to these improvements were $1.5 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial real -- commercial insurance renewals, which are lower in the second and fourth quarters of the year, and a $1 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees due to the lower loan prepayments fees. 
Included in other noninterest income this quarter was $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $248.6 million increased $5.1 million or 2% from the first quarter. Included in the second quarter results were merger-related expenses of $2.9 million.
$2.1 million of the merger-related expenses are in professional and outside services, while the remainder is in other noninterest expense.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $2.2 million or 1% from the first quarter.
The primary driver of this increase was $4.1 million in costs related to 10 branch closures, spread throughout the franchise as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
In addition, advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.6 million. Both branch closure and advertising and promotion costs are located in the other expense lines in our earnings release.
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits, driven by lower payroll-related and benefit cost, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter.
We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis as shown on Slide 9. On a year-over-year basis, the efficiency ratio is flat. 
However, as a reminder, beginning last quarter, the efficiency ratio includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income.
As demonstrated on Slide 10, asset quality continues to be exceptional. As a result of our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards.
Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 62 basis points was up 4 basis points linked quarter, but improved 5 basis points from an already low level in the prior year quarter.
The modest increase from the end of the first quarter was driven by 2 unrelated C&I credits. This metric continues to be well below our peer group in top 50 banks.
Net charge-offs of 6 basis points was unchanged from the most recent quarter and continues to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to Slide 11. We remain pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics.
Return on average assets of 1% and return on average tangible common equity of 13.9%, each improved compared to the prior year quarter and first quarter.
On an operating basis, return on average assets of 99 basis points increased 22 basis points from a year ago, and return on average tangible common equity of 14.2% was up 330 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.
Continuing to Slide 13. We display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based, up from 43% at the end of the first quarter and a year ago.
Before opening the call up for questions, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update for our full year 2018 goals.
It is important to note these goals do not include First Connecticut but do incorporate the acquisition of Vend Lease.
Our updated goals are as follows: Acknowledging the impact on first half 2018 loan growth from commercial real estate headwinds and the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 3% to 5%, a modest reduction to our original goal.
Deposit growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%.
Total expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are now in the range of $975 million to $985 million.
Finally, we have also lowered our provision to a range of $25 million to $35 million. It is important to note that full year goals for net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged.
In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year earnings expectations.
Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

Our equipment finance businesses have all been showing good growth, and they are typically stronger in the second half of the year than they are in the first, anyway. So they're coming into the second half with some momentum that we find encouraging. And finally, the commercial real estate business, while they do have a good pipeline. As Jack and David both referenced, it is -- the market is challenging. And I think as we talked in the past, a lot of our customers are -- what I would consider middle-market real state customers, they are investing their own money. So they tend to be a little bit more conservative. They are not funds, investing other people's money. And so on balance, they're less active than maybe some of the recent funds in the market.

It really has a lot to do with how competitive retail deposits wind up being. The commercial deposit betas have moved up and they are exactly where we would expect them to be at this point, in the rate cycle. The retail competition is rational, as Jack referenced. But you're starting to see more banks running specials, especially in the CD market, and the CD rates have gotten to the point where you are seeing balances start to migrate out of some nonmaturity deposits, like savings accounts and now accounts in the CD. So it's just going to be the pace of that. I'd be surprised if we hit a 50% aggregate beta by the end of this year. But I would not be surprised if that occurs in 2019."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $",1000,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $110.2 million or $0.31 per common share. These results reflect the continued benefits of investments in revenue-producing initiatives, sustained excellent asset quality and recent successful acquisitions.
On an operating basis, earnings were $0.32 per common share, up $0.08 or 33% from a year ago, and operating return on average tangible common equity was 14.2%, an increase of 330 basis points over the same period.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated the second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis.
Total revenues of $396 million increased 3% as a result of growth in both net interest income, driven by net interest margin expansion and noninterest income.
The margin improved 5 basis points and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost.
Operating expenses of $246 million, which includes $4 million in costs related to branch closures increased only $2 million or 1%.
Average loan balances were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances were up $408 million or 1%, reflecting stronger activity in June compared to the first 2 months of the quarter.
Growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending.
Year-to-date overall loan growth has been flat and below our expectations. These results are primarily attributed to continued headwinds in commercial real estate, which have caused balances in this portfolio to decline over $300 million or 6% annualized during the first half of 2018.
As we have discussed previously, commercial real estate has been impacted by a runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which has totaled $228 million year-to-date, heightened competition and above average payoffs.
Since commercial real estate is our largest portfolio, these headwinds have reduced the rate of growth of the overall portfolio.
Additionally, year-to-date loan growth has also been impacted by a decline of over $100 million in home equity balances or 10% annualized, which is consistent with overall industry results. The reduction in home equity balances is driven by lower originations and lower initial utilization rates. 
However, exclusive of commercial real estate and home equity, we are experiencing strong results across many of our businesses that are in line with our expectations for the year.
For example, middle-market C&I has achieved 5% annualized growth this year, while equipment financing is up 10% annualized.
Looking forward, the strength of our diversified business mix, the solid period-end pipelines and continued benefits from revenue-producing initiatives caused us to be optimistic that loan growth in the second half of the year will be meaningfully better than the first 6 months.
Moving onto deposits. Balances were lower as a result of seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. However, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
We did see a pickup in industry deposit cost during the second quarter. However, in our view, the industry continues to behave rationally. While we will remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect share and client relationships, we will continue to be disciplined and not lead the market in pricing.
Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of Vend Lease, a Baltimore-based equipment finance company, established in 1979, that operates primarily in the hospitality industry.
Vend Lease shares our client-centric approach, has a highly specialized skill set and is a recognized brand in the market it serves. The company will become a division of lease commercial capital, enabling it to leverage leased technology platform, marketing team and leading automation capabilities, creating greater efficiencies across sales and operational functions.
Additionally, Vend Lease will also be able to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet and a lower funding cost to further accelerate growth and enhance profitability.
We are excited about the transaction as the strength of our combined expertise will provide an exceptional experience for clients, even our network of specialty finance experts and bolster our nationwide businesses.
Additionally, in June, we announced an agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp, a holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction continues the momentum generated from our recent acquisitions of Suffolk and LEAF as well as provides us with a classic in-market acquisition of a high-quality franchise that further strengthens our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach.
As a result of the integration activities, we are even more excited about the transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us.
This transaction has low execution risk, given our significant knowledge with Farmington Bank and the history of successful integrations. We are confident the transaction will close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
Finally, as many of you know, Jeff Tengel was promoted to President during the second quarter and is leading the full complement of business lines at People's United. Jeff joined the company in 2010 from PNC Bank to lead the commercial division.
Since that time, he has significantly expanded the commercial division and its product offerings with the addition of mortgage warehouse, large corporate banking, international services, health care and syndications. He has broadened and grown treasury management, government banking, asset-based lending and the equipment-financed businesses.
He has also played an important role in integrating the numerous acquisitions completed over the last 8 years. As we continue to grow as a company, we need to make sure our organizational structure supports the future trajectory of People's United.
Jeff is uniquely qualified to help lead us through our future expansion.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the second quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.
The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1.1 million from higher yields in the securities portfolio.
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.4 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost.
In addition, net interest income was unfavorably impacted by $4.8 million, resulting from an increase in borrowing cost.
Net interest margin of 3.10% was 5 basis points higher than the first quarter.
As displayed on Slide 4, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 13 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day by -- while higher yields in the securities portfolio added 1 basis point. 
Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing cost lowered the margin by 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively.
Looking at loans on Slide 5, average balances of $32.1 billion were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances of $32.5 billion were up $408 million or 1%.
The growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending.
The increase in equipment financing balances was driven by each of our equipment financing units, with particularly strong results coming from LEAF.
In addition, the acquisition of Vend Lease, which closed at the end of June added $68 million to the LEAF portfolio. The mortgage warehouse lending portfolio rebounded in the second quarter as balances ended the period at $1.1 billion, up $95 million than the end of the first quarter.
Commercial real estate balances declined on both an average and period-end basis as the portfolio continued to be impacted by the factors Jack outlined earlier.
However, excluding the runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio of $79 million, commercial real estate balances grew modestly from the end of the first quarter.
We now expect the runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio to be $350 million to $400 million for the full year, an increase from our expectation in January of $250 million to $300 million.
Average deposit balances for the second quarter were $32.5 billion, down $288 million or 1% linked quarter, while period-end deposits were also $32.5 billion, down $426 million or 1%. The lower balance has resulted from seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses.
On a period-end basis, municipal and retail balances declined approximately $500 million and $100 million, respectively for the quarter.
Looking forward, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
Turning to Slide 6, which displays average deposits by product, you can see the $288 million reductions, while it was driven by a $268 million decline in interest-bearing checking and money market balances, and $154 million decline in savings balances.
The declines were partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing checking balances of $76 million and time balances of $58 million.
While deposit costs were up 8 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 20% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 33% during the same period.
Specifically, for the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 40%, while the loan yield beta was 76%.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $94.9 million increased $4.5 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in noninterest income was driven primarily by higher customer interest rate swap income of $2.5 million as well as increases in bank service charges and cash management fees.
The largest offsets to these improvements were $1.5 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial real -- commercial insurance renewals, which are lower in the second and fourth quarters of the year, and a $1 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees due to the lower loan prepayments fees. 
Included in other noninterest income this quarter was $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $248.6 million increased $5.1 million or 2% from the first quarter. Included in the second quarter results were merger-related expenses of $2.9 million.
$2.1 million of the merger-related expenses are in professional and outside services, while the remainder is in other noninterest expense.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $2.2 million or 1% from the first quarter.
The primary driver of this increase was $4.1 million in costs related to 10 branch closures, spread throughout the franchise as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
In addition, advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.6 million. Both branch closure and advertising and promotion costs are located in the other expense lines in our earnings release.
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits, driven by lower payroll-related and benefit cost, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter.
We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis as shown on Slide 9. On a year-over-year basis, the efficiency ratio is flat. 
However, as a reminder, beginning last quarter, the efficiency ratio includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income.
As demonstrated on Slide 10, asset quality continues to be exceptional. As a result of our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards.
Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 62 basis points was up 4 basis points linked quarter, but improved 5 basis points from an already low level in the prior year quarter.
The modest increase from the end of the first quarter was driven by 2 unrelated C&I credits. This metric continues to be well below our peer group in top 50 banks.
Net charge-offs of 6 basis points was unchanged from the most recent quarter and continues to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to Slide 11. We remain pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics.
Return on average assets of 1% and return on average tangible common equity of 13.9%, each improved compared to the prior year quarter and first quarter.
On an operating basis, return on average assets of 99 basis points increased 22 basis points from a year ago, and return on average tangible common equity of 14.2% was up 330 basis points over the same period.
As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.
Continuing to Slide 13. We display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based, up from 43% at the end of the first quarter and a year ago.
Before opening the call up for questions, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update for our full year 2018 goals.
It is important to note these goals do not include First Connecticut but do incorporate the acquisition of Vend Lease.
Our updated goals are as follows: Acknowledging the impact on first half 2018 loan growth from commercial real estate headwinds and the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 3% to 5%, a modest reduction to our original goal.
Deposit growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%.
Total expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are now in the range of $975 million to $985 million.
Finally, we have also lowered our provision to a range of $25 million to $35 million. It is important to note that full year goals for net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged.
In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year earnings expectations.
Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

Our equipment finance businesses have all been showing good growth, and they are typically stronger in the second half of the year than they are in the first, anyway. So they're coming into the second half with some momentum that we find encouraging. And finally, the commercial real estate business, while they do have a good pipeline. As Jack and David both referenced, it is -- the market is challenging. And I think as we talked in the past, a lot of our customers are -- what I would consider middle-market real state customers, they are investing their own money. So they tend to be a little bit more conservative. They are not funds, investing other people's money. And so on balance, they're less active than maybe some of the recent funds in the market. But we are still supporting them, we're still very active with our customers.

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $",1001,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $110.2 million or $0.31 per common share. These results reflect the continued benefits of investments in revenue-producing initiatives, sustained excellent asset quality and recent successful acquisitions.
On an operating basis, earnings were $0.32 per common share, up $0.08 or 33% from a year ago, and operating return on average tangible common equity was 14.2%, an increase of 330 basis points over the same period.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated the second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Total revenues of $396 million increased 3% as a result of growth in both net interest income, driven by net interest margin expansion and noninterest income. The margin improved 5 basis points and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost.
Operating expenses of $246 million, which includes $4 million in costs related to branch closures increased only $2 million or 1%. Average loan balances were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances were up $408 million or 1%, reflecting stronger activity in June compared to the first 2 months of the quarter. Growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending.
Year-to-date overall loan growth has been flat and below our expectations. These results are primarily attributed to continued headwinds in commercial real estate, which have caused balances in this portfolio to decline over $300 million or 6% annualized during the first half of 2018.
As we have discussed previously, commercial real estate has been impacted by a runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which has totaled $228 million year-to-date, heightened competition and above average payoffs. Since commercial real estate is our largest portfolio, these headwinds have reduced the rate of growth of the overall portfolio.
Additionally, year-to-date loan growth has also been impacted by a decline of over $100 million in home equity balances or 10% annualized, which is consistent with overall industry results. The reduction in home equity balances is driven by lower originations and lower initial utilization rates. 
However, exclusive of commercial real estate and home equity, we are experiencing strong results across many of our businesses that are in line with our expectations for the year. For example, middle-market C&I has achieved 5% annualized growth this year, while equipment financing is up 10% annualized.
Looking forward, the strength of our diversified business mix, the solid period-end pipelines and continued benefits from revenue-producing initiatives caused us to be optimistic that loan growth in the second half of the year will be meaningfully better than the first 6 months.
Moving on to deposits. Balances were lower as a result of seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. However, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
We did see a pickup in industry deposit cost during the second quarter. However, in our view, the industry continues to behave rationally. While we will remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect share and client relationships, we will continue to be disciplined and not lead the market in pricing.
Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of Vend Lease, a Baltimore-based equipment finance company, established in 1979, that operates primarily in the hospitality industry.
Vend Lease shares our client-centric approach, has a highly specialized skill set and is a recognized brand in the market it serves. The company will become a division of lease commercial capital, enabling it to leverage leased technology platform, marketing team and leading automation capabilities, creating greater efficiencies across sales and operational functions.
Additionally, Vend Lease will also be able to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet and a lower funding cost to further accelerate growth and enhance profitability. We are excited about the transaction as the strength of our combined expertise will provide an exceptional experience for clients, even our network of specialty finance experts and bolster our nationwide businesses.
Additionally, in June, we announced an agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp, a holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction continues the momentum generated from our recent acquisitions of Suffolk and LEAF as well as provides us with a classic in-market acquisition of a high-quality franchise that further strengthens our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach. As a result of the integration activities, we are even more excited about the transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. This transaction has low execution risk, given our significant knowledge with Farmington Bank and the history of successful integrations. We are confident the transaction will close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
Finally, as many of you know, Jeff Tengel was promoted to President during the second quarter and is leading the full complement of business lines at People's United. Jeff joined the company in 2010 from PNC Bank to lead the commercial division.
Since that time, he has significantly expanded the commercial division and its product offerings with the addition of mortgage warehouse, large corporate banking, international services, health care and syndications. He has broadened and grown treasury management, government banking, asset-based lending and the equipment-financed businesses.
He has also played an important role in integrating the numerous acquisitions completed over the last 8 years. As we continue to grow as a company, we need to make sure our organizational structure supports the future trajectory of People's United.
Jeff is uniquely qualified to help lead us through our future expansion.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the second quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business an",1485,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.
The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans.
Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1.1 million from higher yields in the securities portfolio. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.4 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. In addition, net interest income was unfavorably impacted by $4.8 million, resulting from an increase in borrowing cost. Net interest margin of 3.10% was 5 basis points higher than the first quarter.
As displayed on Slide 4, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 13 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day by -- while higher yields in the securities portfolio added 1 basis point. Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing cost lowered the margin by 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively.
Looking at loans on Slide 5, average balances of $32.1 billion were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances of $32.5 billion were up $408 million or 1%. The growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing and mortgage warehouse lending. The increase in equipment financing balances was driven by each of our equipment financing units, with particularly strong results coming from LEAF.
In addition, the acquisition of Vend Lease, which closed at the end of June added $68 million to the LEAF portfolio. The mortgage warehouse lending portfolio rebounded in the second quarter as balances ended the period at $1.1 billion, up $95 million than the end of the first quarter. Commercial real estate balances declined on both an average and period-end basis as the portfolio continued to be impacted by the factors Jack outlined earlier.
However, excluding the runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio of $79 million, commercial real estate balances grew modestly from the end of the first quarter. We now expect the runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio to be $350 million to $400 million for the full year, an increase from our expectation in January of $250 million to $300 million. Average deposit balances for the second quarter were $32.5 billion, down $288 million or 1% linked quarter, while period-end deposits were also $32.5 billion, down $426 million or 1%. The lower balance has resulted from seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses.
On a period-end basis, municipal and retail balances declined approximately $500 million and $100 million, respectively for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters, in line with historical seasonal trends.
Turning to Slide 6, which displays average deposits by product, you can see the $288 million reductions, while it was driven by a $268 million decline in interest-bearing checking and money market balances, and $154 million decline in savings balances.
The declines were partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing checking balances of $76 million and time balances of $58 million.
While deposit costs were up 8 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 20% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 33% during the same period. Specifically, for the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 40%, while the loan yield beta was 76%.
Looking at Slide 7, noninterest income of $94.9 million increased $4.5 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in noninterest income was driven primarily by higher customer interest rate swap income of $2.5 million as well as increases in bank service charges and cash management fees.
The largest offsets to these improvements were $1.5 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial real -- commercial insurance renewals, which are lower in the second and fourth quarters of the year, and a $1 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees due to the lower loan prepayments fees. Included in other noninterest income this quarter was $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments.
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $248.6 million increased $5.1 million or 2% from the first quarter. Included in the second quarter results were merger-related expenses of $2.9 million.
$2.1 million of the merger-related expenses are in professional and outside services, while the remainder is in other noninterest expense.
Excluding merger-related expenses, noninterest expenses increased $2.2 million or 1% from the first quarter.
The primary driver of this increase was $4.1 million in costs related to 10 branch closures, spread throughout the franchise as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
In addition, advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.6 million. Both branch closure and advertising and promotion costs are located in the other expense lines in our earnings release.
The largest offset to these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits, driven by lower payroll-related and benefit cost, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter.
We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio.
Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis as shown on Slide 9. On a year-over-year basis, the efficiency ratio is flat. 
However, as a reminder, beginning last quarter, the efficiency ratio includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income.
As demonstrated on Slide 10, asset quality continues to be exceptional. As a result of our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards.
Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 62 basis points was up 4 basis points linked quarter but improved 5 basis points from an already low level in the prior year quarter.
The modest increase from the end of the first quarter was driven by 2 unrelated C&I credits. This metric continues to be well below our peer group in top 50 banks.
Net charge-offs of 6 basis points was unchanged from the most recent quarter and continues to reflect the minimal loss content of our nonperforming assets.
Moving on to Slide 11. We remain pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics.
Return on average assets of 1% and return on average tangible common equity of 13.9%, each improved compared to the prior year quarter and first quarter.
On an operating basis, return on average assets of 99 basis points increased 22 basis points from a year ago, and return on average tangible common equity of 14.2% was up 330 basis points over the same period. As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.
Continuing to Slide 13. We display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising interest rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based, up from 43% at the end of the first quarter and a year ago.
Before opening the call up for questions, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update for our full year 2018 goals. It is important to note these goals do not include First Connecticut but do incorporate the acquisition of Vend Lease.
Our updated goals are as follows: Acknowledging the impact on first half 2018 loan growth from commercial real estate headwinds and the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 3% to 5%, a modest reduction to our original goal.
Deposit growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%. Total expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are now in the range of $975 million to $985 million.
Finally, we have also lowered our provision to a range of $25 million to $35 million. It is important to note that full year goals for net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged.
In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year earnings expectations.

As Jack and David both referenced, it is -- the market is challenging. And I think as we talked in the past, a lot of our customers are -- what I would consider middle-market real state customers, they are investing their own money. So they tend to be a little bit more conservative. They are not funds, investing other people's money. And so on balance, they're less active than maybe some of the recent funds in the market.

Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's diverse business mix. We reported another quarter of record earnings and generated a return on average tangible common equity of 14.5%, an improvement of 270 basis points from a year ago. Net income of $117 million was up 29% year-over-year, while earnings per common share of $0.33 increased $0.07. These results benefited from higher revenues, well consolidated expenses, sustained exceptional asset quality and a lower effective tax rate. Total revenues increased 7% from a year ago and 1% compared to the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, reflecting continued net interest margin expansion. The margins improved 11 basis points year-over-year as well as 5 basis points linked quarter, and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost. As expected, deposits rebounded in the third quarter, with average balances growing $522 million, or 2% from the second quarter. While our deposit costs were up 11 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. As we stated last quarter, we remain competitive gathering deposits in order to protect market share and client relationships. However, we will remain disciplined and not leave the market incisive. Moving on to loans. Average balances were flat compared to the second quarter, while period-end balances were down $313 million or 1%. The decrease in the period-end loans is attributable to a $201 million decline in mortgage warehouse lending balances and a runoff of $128 million in the transactional portion of the New York multi-family portfolio. Year-to-date, loan growth has been below our expectations, primarily due to heightened competition, driven by both bank and nonbank lenders, lower demands and above-average payouts. Looking forward, acknowledging the impact of these headwinds, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as in the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we will not reach our 2018 loan growth goal of 3% to 5% at year-end. However, it is important to note that this shortfall in loan growth does not impact our original full year earnings expectations as we are tracking in line with our other disclosed full year goals. Additionally, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. Pipelines at the end of the third quarter are solid levels, and we expect continuation of positive results across many of our businesses that have performed well this year, including equipment financing and middle market C&I. We're very pleased with the performance of lease as it continues to drive excellent growth at yields that are meaningfully higher than the rest of our total portfolio. The addition of lease to this business at the end of the second quarter has also enhanced the already strong results. In this environment, we continue to emphasize the importance of improving operating leverage as evidenced by third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. We remain focused on growing net interest income and noninterest income as well as tightly managing expenses. We are particularly pleased with our ability to control costs, especially as we further invest in revenue-producing talent and enhanced technology. As the financial needs of our clients evolve, they require bankers who understand their complex challenges, and serve as advisers to help them achieve sustainable growth. As such, we recently bolstered our commercial banking capabilities with the establishment of 3 verticals: franchise finance, technology and not-for-profit. And we concurrently hired 3 Boston-based senior bankers to lead these verticals. We are pleased to have these leaders join People's United as their in-depth industry knowledge and expertise will deepen our current relationships and attract new loans. In addition to investing in revenue-producing talent, we continue to make investments to enhance our technological capabilities. Given that the consumer shift to digital channel is evident, we have been tactically driving various digital initiatives and building a foundation to address opportunities. For example, we are actively engaged with multiple Fintech companies to establish digital origination channels, core deposits, consumer and small business lending and wealth management. We have also invested in a multichannel digital marketing strategy to engage our clients and prospects, generate qualified leads, build relationships and increase sales productivity. Over the past year, we have shaped our marketing strategies to embrace our digital and mobile audiences with new technologies, which allows the bank to deliver personalized digital experiences to clients. The acquisition of Farmington Bank was completed on October 1, and we're pleased with the regulatory process as well as the speeds in which we were able to close the transaction. We are excited about executing in the market as 1 team and deepening our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. Integration has progressed well, and the core system conversion will take place in January. Experienced teams at both companies have worked closely together to ensure a seamless transition for clients, who will benefit from our full suite of products and services as well as enhanced digital capabilities. The addition of Farmington Bank further strengthens the franchise's earnings power as we are confident in achieving the transaction's attractive financial returns. We believe the combination of these 2 customer-focused organizations with similar cultures and complementary commercial and retail capabilities will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the third quarter in more detail."

Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day, $1.2 million from higher yields and balances in the securities portfolio as well as $500,000 in lower borrowing costs. The largest offset to these increases was a $9.1 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. Year-to-date, net interest income is $903.4 million, up $95.3 million or 12% from a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 10% to 12%. Net interest margin of 3 15 expanded 5 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, highlighting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. As displayed on Slide 4, the 5 basis points expansion from the second quarter was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points as new business yields continue to increase and remain higher than the total portfolio yield. Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day, while higher yields in the securities portfolio and lower borrowing costs each added 1 basis point. Conversely, higher deposit cost lowered the margin by 9 basis points. Year-to-date, the net interest margin is 3.10%, up 16 basis points from a year ago, and in the middle of our full year goal range of 3.05% to 3.15%. Looking at loans on Slide 5. Average balances of $32.2 billion were flat compared to the second quarter, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Growth on average balances for equipment financing, residential mortgage and C&I, offset continued declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. On a period-end basis, loans ended the quarter at $32.2 billion, a decrease of $313 million or 1% from June 30, driven by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and the ongoing one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Balances in the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio ended the quarter at $882 million, down $201 million from the close of the second quarter. Importantly, average balances for this portfolio declined only $24 million linked quarter. Since the end of the second quarter, the one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio lowered period-end balances by $128 million, bringing the year-to-date impact to $356 million. As such, we now expect runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio for the full year to be higher than the upper end of our previous expectation of $350 million to $400 million. Moving on to deposits. As expected, growth rebounded in the third quarter as average balances of $33.1 billion were up $522 million or 2% linked quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, time and noninterest-bearing deposits collectively grew by $711 million, while savings and interest-bearing checking and money market comp at average balances declined $157 million and $32 million, respectively in anticipation of the Farmington Bank acquisition closing. And given their elevated loan-to-deposit ratio, we ran various bank-wide CD promotions during the quarter, which successfully eliminated their loan-to-deposit shortfall. On a period-end basis, deposit balances of $32.2 billion increased $742 million or 2% from the end of the second quarter. It is important to note, the loan-to-deposit ratio ended the quarter at 97%, an improvement from 100% at June 30. As Jack referenced earlier, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. Specifically for the third quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 57%, while the loan yield beta was 64%. Looking at Slide 7. Noninterest income of $92.4 million decreased $2.6 million or 3% on a linked-quarter basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, these results increased $3 million or 3%. The linked-quarter decline on interest income was primarily attributable to fee and income tied to lending volumes. Commercial banking lending fees were $1.5 million lower compared to the second quarter, and customer interest rate swap income was down $1.2 million. The largest offsets to these decreases were a $1.5 million increase in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which were higher in the first and third quarters of the year; and $600,000 in higher bank service charges, primarily driven by the additional calendar day in the third quarter. As a reminder, included in other noninterest income for the second quarter were $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments. Year-to-date, noninterest income is $277.6 million, an increase of $12 million or 4.5% compared to a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 3% to 5%. On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $241.3 million improved $7.3 million or 3% linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $500,000 of merger-related costs, with $400,000 in professional and outside services and the remainder in other noninterest expenses. Second quarter merger-related cost were $2.9 million, of which $2.1 million were included in professional and outside services and $800,000 within other. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses improved $4.9 million or 2%. As a reminder, included in second quarter operating expenses within the other expense line in the earnings release was $4.1 million of cost associated with 10 People's Bank branch closures. For the third quarter, we did not have any branch closures or related costs. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter also benefited from $1.9 million in lower professional and outside service cost, primarily due to the timing of projects. The largest offsets to these improvements were an $800,000 increase in occupancy and equipment cost as well as $700,000 in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting additional employees resulting from the lease acquisition. Year-to-date, noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are $730 million and tracking in line with our full year goal range of $975 million to $985 million. We continue to enhance operating leverage, as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, as displayed on Slide 9. Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, the efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points, a particularly strong result as beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the metric includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in lower FTE adjustments to net interest income. We will continue to emphasize improving operating leverage through revenue growth and controlling costs. We remain diligent in maintaining exceptional asset quality, which is the result of our conservative and well-defined approach to underwriting. As demonstrated on Slide 10, originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 57 basis points improved 5 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points from a year ago. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points were up modestly from very low levels in recent quarters, and we continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Moving to returns on Slide 11. Return on average assets of 106 basis points and return on average tangible common equity of 14.5% each increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. Year-over-year, return on average assets improved 22 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was up 270 basis points. We are pleased with the progress we have made, enhancing our profitability metrics. As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics. Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with the end of the second quarter and up from 43% a year ago. Before opening up the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that the full year 2018 goals we updated in July did not incorporate Farmington Bank. With less than a quarter less in the year, we are not going to provide an update to these goals to improve Farmington. However, we wanted to share the following September 30 data points for Farmington. Period-end loans and deposits closed the quarter at $2.97 billion and $2.40 billion, respectively. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

It is -- we had line utilization down in the quarter, 2, 3 basis points. So with that, to us, says the customers have cash and they're using it to pay down the line. Well some of our balance impacted that. I would say, we look at the economic data and we think things are in pretty good shape, but we don't see increased demands. We certainly have pipelines and when we think of people looking to expand brands or increase inventory levels, they're carrying we're not feeling like there's a lot of that. So I think there's a lot of things, a lot of -- there's a lot of competition. It does seem to be just okay demand, but not strong, giving the economic data. And in fact, we saw some low utilizations.

We're actually at, last quarter, when we saw the deposit beta would hit 50%. Our thinking there and that's cumulative, not within the quarter. Our thinking is still -- that's still in the back half of 2019. The deposit market across commercial, municipal, retail continues to be competitive. We, in this quarter, run some CD specials as we called out. Those CD specials or money market specials are still relatively reasonable funding cost. So the industry has behaved reasonably to date, so all of our betas are creeping up. But I'm not expecting unreasonable behavior coming from the competitors that we face."

Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's",972,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's diverse business mix. We reported another quarter of record earnings and generated a return on average tangible common equity of 14.5%, an improvement of 270 basis points from a year ago. Net income of $117 million was up 29% year-over-year, while earnings per common share of $0.33 increased $0.07. These results benefited from higher revenues, well-controlled expenses, sustained exceptional asset quality and a lower effective tax rate. 
Total revenues increased 7% from a year ago and 1% compared to the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, reflecting continued net interest margin expansion. The margins improved 11 basis points year-over-year as well as 5 basis points linked quarter and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost. 
As expected, deposits rebounded in the third quarter, with average balances growing $522 million or 2% from the second quarter. While our deposit costs were up 11 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. 
As we stated last quarter, we remain competitive gathering deposits in order to protect market share and client relationships. However, we will remain disciplined and not lead the market [ in slicing ]. 
Moving on to loans. Average balances were flat compared to the second quarter, while period-end balances were down $313 million or 1%. The decrease in the period-end loans is attributable to a $201 million decline in mortgage warehouse lending balances and a runoff of $128 million in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio. Year-to-date, loan growth has been below our expectations primarily due to heightened competition driven by both bank and nonbank lenders, lower demands and above-average payouts. 
Looking forward, acknowledging the impact of these headwinds, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as in the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we will not reach our 2018 loan growth goal of 3% to 5% at year-end. However, it is important to note that this shortfall in loan growth does not impact our original full year earnings expectations as we are tracking in line with our other disclosed full year goals. 
Additionally, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. Pipelines at the end of the third quarter are at solid levels, and we expect continuation of positive results across many of our businesses that have performed well this year, including equipment financing and middle market C&I. 
We're very pleased with the performance of lease as it continues to drive excellent growth at yields that are meaningfully higher than the rest of our total portfolio. The addition of Vend Lease to this business at the end of the second quarter has also enhanced these already strong results. In this environment, we continue to emphasize the importance of improving operating leverage as evidenced by a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
We remain focused on growing net interest income and noninterest income as well as tightly managing expenses. We are particularly pleased with our ability to control costs, especially as we further invest in revenue-producing talent and enhanced technology. 
As the financial needs of our clients evolve, they require bankers who understand their complex challenges and serve as advisers to help them achieve sustainable growth. As such, we recently bolstered our commercial banking capabilities with the establishment of 3 verticals: franchise finance, technology and not-for-profit. And we concurrently hired 3 Boston-based senior bankers to lead these verticals. We are pleased to have these leaders join People's United as their in-depth industry knowledge and expertise will deepen our current relationships and attract new ones.
In addition to investing in revenue-producing talent, we continue to make investments to enhance our technological capabilities. Given that the consumer shift to digital channel is evident, we have been tactically driving various digital initiatives and building a foundation to address opportunities. For example, we are actively engaged with multiple fintech companies to establish digital origination channels for deposits, consumer and small business lending and wealth management. We have also invested in a multichannel digital marketing strategy to engage our clients and prospects, generate qualified leads, build relationships and increase sales productivity. 
Over the past year, we have shaped our marketing strategies to embrace our digital and mobile audiences with new technologies, which allows the bank to deliver personalized digital experiences to clients. 
The acquisition of Farmington Bank was completed on October 1, and we're pleased with the regulatory process as well as the speeds in which we were able to close the transaction. We are excited about executing in the market as one team and deepening our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. Integration has progressed well, and the core system conversion will take place in January. Experienced teams at both companies have worked closely together to ensure a seamless transition for clients, who will benefit from our full suite of products and services as well as enhanced digital capabilities. 
The addition of Farmington Bank further strengthens the franchises' earnings power as we are confident in achieving the transaction's attractive financial returns. We believe the combination of these 2 customer-focused organizations with similar cultures and complementary commercial and retail capabilities will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the third quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and",1485,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day, $1.2 million from higher yields and balances in the securities portfolio as well as $500,000 in lower borrowing costs. The largest offset to these increases was a $9.1 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. 
Year-to-date, net interest income is $903.4 million, up $95.3 million or 12% from a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 10% to 12%. Net interest margin of 3.15% expanded 5 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, highlighting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. As displayed on Slide 4, the 5 basis point expansion from the second quarter was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points as new business yields continue to increase and remain higher than the total portfolio yield. Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day, while higher yields in the securities portfolio and lower borrowing costs each added 1 basis point. Conversely, higher deposit cost lowered the margin by 9 basis points. 
Year-to-date, the net interest margin is 3.10%, up 16 basis points from a year ago, and in the middle of our full year goal range of 3.05% to 3.15%. 
Looking at loans on Slide 5. Average balances of $32.2 billion were flat compared to the second quarter, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Growth on average balances for equipment financing, residential mortgage and C&I offset continued declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. On a period-end basis, loans ended the quarter at $32.2 billion, a decrease of $313 million or 1% from June 30, driven by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and the ongoing one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Balances in the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio ended the quarter at $882 million, down $201 million from the close of the second quarter. Importantly, average balances for this portfolio declined only $24 million linked quarter. 
Since the end of the second quarter, the one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio lowered period-end balances by $128 million, bringing the year-to-date impact to $356 million. As such, we now expect runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio for the full year to be higher than the upper end of our previous expectation of $350 million to $400 million. 
Moving on to deposits. As expected, growth rebounded in the third quarter as average balances of $33.1 billion were up $522 million or 2% linked quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, time and noninterest-bearing deposits collectively grew by $711 million, while savings and interest-bearing checking and money market comp, the average balances declined $157 million and $32 million, respectively, in anticipation of the Farmington Bank acquisition closing. And given their elevated loan-to-deposit ratio, we ran various bank-wide CD promotions during the quarter, which successfully eliminated their loan-to-deposit shortfall. 
On a period-end basis, deposit balances of $32.2 billion increased $742 million or 2% from the end of the second quarter. It is important to note the loan-to-deposit ratio ended the quarter at 97%, an improvement from 100% at June 30. 
As Jack referenced earlier, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. Specifically for the third quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 57%, while the loan yield beta was 64%. 
Looking at Slide 7. Noninterest income of $92.4 million decreased $2.6 million or 3% on a linked-quarter basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, these results increased $3 million or 3%. The linked-quarter decline on interest income was primarily attributable to fee and income tied to lending volumes. Commercial banking lending fees were $1.5 million lower compared to the second quarter, and customer interest rate swap income was down $1.2 million. The largest offsets to these decreases were a $1.5 million increase in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which were higher in the first and third quarters of the year; and $600,000 in higher bank service charges, primarily driven by the additional calendar day in the third quarter. As a reminder, included in other noninterest income for the second quarter were $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments. 
Year-to-date, noninterest income is $277.6 million, an increase of $12 million or 4.5% compared to a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 3% to 5%. 
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $241.3 million improved $7.3 million or 3% linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $500,000 of merger-related costs, with $400,000 in professional and outside services and the remainder in other noninterest expenses. Second quarter merger-related costs were $2.9 million, of which $2.1 million were included in professional and outside services and $800,000 within other. 
Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses improved $4.9 million or 2%. As a reminder, included in second quarter operating expenses within the other expense line in the earnings release was $4.1 million of cost associated with 10 People's Bank branch closures. For the third quarter, we did not have any branch closures or related costs. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter also benefited from $1.9 million in lower professional and outside service cost primarily due to the timing of projects. The largest offsets to these improvements were an $800,000 increase in occupancy and equipment cost as well as $700,000 in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting additional employees resulting from the Vend Lease acquisition. 
Year-to-date, noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are $730 million and tracking in line with our full year goal range of $975 million to $985 million. We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, as displayed on Slide 9. Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, the efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points, a particularly strong result as beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the metric includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in lower FTE adjustments to net interest income. 
We will continue to emphasize improving operating leverage through revenue growth and controlling costs. We remain diligent in maintaining exceptional asset quality, which is the result of our conservative and well-defined approach to underwriting. 
As demonstrated on Slide 10, originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 57 basis points improved 5 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points from a year ago. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points were up modestly from very low levels in recent quarters, and we continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. 
Moving to returns on Slide 11. Return on average assets of 106 basis points and return on average tangible common equity of 14.5% each increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. Year-over-year, return on average assets improved 22 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was up 270 basis points. We are pleased with the progress we have made enhancing our profitability metrics. As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics. 
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. 
The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with the end of the second quarter and up from 43% a year ago. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that the full year 2018 goals we updated in July did not incorporate Farmington Bank. With less than a quarter left in the year, we are not going to provide an update to these goals to include Farmington. However, we wanted to share the following September 30 data points for Farmington. Period-end loans and deposits closed the quarter at $2.97 billion and $2.40 billion, respectively. 
Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

I would say, well, the core middle market business has always been very competitive both in terms of larger bank competitors but also smaller banks across the footprint.

It -- we had line utilization down in the quarter 2, 3 basis points so that, to us, says the customers have cash and they're using it to pay down line. So some of our balance impact is that. I would say, we  look at the economic data and we think things are in pretty good shape, but we don't see increased demand. We certainly have pipelines, and when we think of people looking to expand plants or increase inventory levels they're carrying, we're not feeling like there's a lot of that. So I think there's a lot of things, a lot of -- there's a lot of competition. It does seem to be just okay demand, not -- but not strong given the economic data.

Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's",971,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's diverse business mix. We reported another quarter of record earnings and generated a return on average tangible common equity of 14.5%, an improvement of 270 basis points from a year ago. Net income of $117 million was up 29% year-over-year, while earnings per common share of $0.33 increased $0.07. These results benefited from higher revenues, well-controlled expenses, sustained exceptional asset quality and a lower effective tax rate. 
Total revenues increased 7% from a year ago and 1% compared to the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, reflecting continued net interest margin expansion. The margin has improved 11 basis points year-over-year as well as 5 basis points linked quarter and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost. 
As expected, deposits rebounded in the third quarter, with average balances growing $522 million or 2% from the second quarter. While our deposit costs were up 11 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. 
As we stated last quarter, we remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect market share and client relationships. However, we will remain disciplined and not lead the market in pricing. 
Moving on to loans. Average balances were flat compared to the second quarter, while the period-end balances were down $313 million or 1%. The decrease in the period-end loans is attributable to a $201 million decline in mortgage warehouse lending balances and a runoff of $128 million in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio. Year-to-date, loan growth has been below our expectations, primarily due to heightened competition driven by both bank and nonbank lenders, lower demands and above-average payouts. 
Looking forward, acknowledging the impact of these headwinds, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we will not reach our 2018 loan growth goal of 3% to 5% at year-end. However, it is important to note that this shortfall in loan growth does not impact our original full year earnings expectations as we are tracking in line with our other disclosed full year goals. 
Additionally, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. Pipelines at the end of the third quarter are at solid levels, and we expect continuation of positive results across many of our businesses that have performed well this year, including equipment financing and middle market C&I. 
We're very pleased with the performance of lease as it continues to drive excellent growth at yields that are meaningfully higher than the rest of our total portfolio. The addition of Vend Lease to this business at the end of the second quarter has also enhanced these already strong results. In this environment, we continue to emphasize the importance of improving operating leverage as evidenced by a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
We remain focused on growing net interest income and noninterest income as well as tightly managing expenses. We are particularly pleased with our ability to control costs, especially as we further invest in revenue-producing talent and enhanced technology. 
As the financial needs of our clients evolve, they require bankers who understand their complex challenges and serve as advisers to help them achieve sustainable growth. As such, we recently bolstered our commercial banking capabilities with the establishment of 3 verticals: franchise finance, technology and not-for-profit. And we concurrently hired 3 Boston-based senior bankers to lead these verticals. We are pleased to have these leaders join People's United as their in-depth industry knowledge and expertise will deepen our current relationships and attract new ones.
In addition to investing in revenue-producing talent, we continue to make investments to enhance our technological capabilities. Given that the consumer shift to digital channel is evident, we have been tactically driving various digital initiatives and building a foundation to address opportunities. For example, we are actively engaged with multiple fintech companies to establish digital origination channels for deposits, consumer and small business lending and wealth management. We have also invested in a multichannel digital marketing strategy to engage our clients and prospects, generate qualified leads, build relationships and increase sales productivity. 
Over the past year, we have shaped our marketing strategies to embrace our digital and mobile audiences with new technologies, which allow the bank to deliver personalized digital experiences to clients. 
The acquisition of Farmington Bank was completed on October 1, and we're pleased with the regulatory process as well as the speed in which we were able to close the transaction. We are excited about executing in the market as one team and deepening our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. Integration has progressed well, and the core system conversion will take place in January. Experienced teams at both companies have worked closely together to ensure a seamless transition for clients, who will benefit from our full suite of products and services as well as enhanced digital capabilities. 
The addition of Farmington Bank further strengthens the franchise's earnings power as we are confident in achieving the transaction's attractive financial returns. We believe the combination of these 2 customer-focused organizations with similar cultures and complementary commercial and retail capabilities will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the third quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and",1483,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day, $1.2 million from higher yields and balances in the securities portfolio as well as $500,000 in lower borrowing costs. The largest offset to these increases was a $9.1 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. 
Year-to-date, net interest income is $903.4 million, up $95.3 million or 12% from a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 10% to 12%. Net interest margin of 3.15% expanded 5 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, highlighting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. As displayed on Slide 4, the 5 basis point expansion from the second quarter was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points as new business yields continue to increase and remain higher than the total portfolio yield. Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day, while higher yields in the securities portfolio and lower borrowing costs each added 1 basis point. Conversely, higher deposit cost lowered the margin by 9 basis points. 
Year-to-date, the net interest margin is 3.10%, up 16 basis points from a year ago, and in the middle of our full year goal range of 3.05% to 3.15%. 
Looking at loans on Slide 5. Average balances of $32.2 billion were flat compared to the second quarter, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Growth in average balances for equipment financing, residential mortgage and C&I offset continued declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. On a period-end basis, loans ended the quarter at $32.2 billion, a decrease of $313 million or 1% from June 30, driven by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and the ongoing one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Balances in the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio ended the quarter at $882 million, down $201 million from the close of the second quarter. Importantly, average balances for this portfolio declined only $24 million linked quarter. 
Since the end of the second quarter, a one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio lowered period-end balances by $128 million, bringing the year-to-date impact to $356 million. As such, we now expect runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio for the full year to be higher than the upper end of our previous expectation of $350 million to $400 million. 
Moving on to deposits. As expected, growth rebounded in the third quarter as average balances of $33.1 billion were up $522 million or 2% linked quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, time and noninterest-bearing deposits collectively grew by $711 million, while savings and interest-bearing checking and money market, the average balances declined $157 million and $32 million, respectively.  In anticipation of the Farmington Bank acquisition closing, and given their elevated loan-to-deposit ratio, we ran various bank-wide CD promotions during the quarter, which successfully eliminated their loan-to-deposit shortfall. 
On a period-end basis, deposit balances of $32.2 billion increased $742 million or 2% from the end of the second quarter. It is important to note the loan-to-deposit ratio ended the quarter at 97%, an improvement from 100% at June 30. 
As Jack referenced earlier, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. Specifically for the third quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 57%, while the loan yield beta was 64%. 
Looking at Slide 7. Noninterest income of $92.4 million decreased $2.6 million or 3% on a linked-quarter basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, these results increased $3 million or 3%. The linked-quarter decline in noninterest income was primarily attributable to fee and income tied to lending volumes. Commercial banking lending fees were $1.5 million lower compared to the second quarter, and customer interest rate swap income was down $1.2 million. The largest offsets to these decreases were a $1.5 million increase in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year; and $600,000 in higher bank service charges, primarily driven by the additional calendar day in the third quarter. As a reminder, included in other noninterest income for the second quarter were $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments. 
Year-to-date, noninterest income is $277.6 million, an increase of $12 million or 4.5% compared to a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 3% to 5%. 
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $241.3 million improved $7.3 million or 3% linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $500,000 of merger-related costs, with $400,000 in professional and outside services and the remainder in other noninterest expenses. Second quarter merger-related costs were $2.9 million, of which $2.1 million were included in professional and outside services and $800,000 within other. 
Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses improved $4.9 million or 2%. As a reminder, included in second quarter operating expenses within the other expense line in the earnings release was $4.1 million of costs associated with 10 People's Bank branch closures. For the third quarter, we did not have any branch closures or related costs. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter also benefited from $1.9 million in lower professional and outside service costs primarily due to the timing of projects. The largest offsets to these improvements were an $800,000 increase in occupancy and equipment cost as well as $700,000 in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting additional employees resulting from the Vend Lease acquisition. 
Year-to-date, noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are $730 million and tracking in line with our full year goal range of $975 million to $985 million. We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, as displayed on Slide 9. Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, the efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points, a particularly strong result as beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the metric includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in lower FTE adjustments to net interest income. 
We will continue to emphasize improving operating leverage through revenue growth and controlling costs. We remain diligent in maintaining exceptional asset quality, which is the result of our conservative and well-defined approach to underwriting. 
As demonstrated on Slide 10, originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 57 basis points improved 5 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points from a year ago. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points were up modestly from very low levels in recent quarters and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. 
Moving to returns on Slide 11. Return on average assets of 106 basis points and return on average tangible common equity of 14.5% each increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. Year-over-year, return on average assets improved 22 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was up 270 basis points. We are pleased with the progress we have made enhancing our profitability metrics. As we continue to build the earning power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics. 
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. 
The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with the end of the second quarter and up from 43% a year ago. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that the full year 2018 goals we updated in July did not incorporate Farmington Bank. With less than a quarter left in the year, we are not going to provide an update to these goals to include Farmington. However, we wanted to share the following September 30 data points for Farmington. Period-end loans and deposits closed the quarter at $2.97 billion and $2.40 billion, respectively. 
Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

It -- we had line utilization down in the quarter 2, 3 basis points so that, to us, says the customers have cash and they're using it to pay down lines. So some of our balance impact is that. I would say, we look at the economic data and we think things are in pretty good shape, but we don't see increased demand. We certainly have pipelines, and when we think of people looking to expand plants or increase inventory levels they're carrying, we're not feeling like there's a lot of that. So I think there's a lot of things, a lot of -- there's a lot of competition. It does seem to be just okay demand, but not strong given the economic data. And in fact, we saw some lower utilization.

Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's",971,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. The results this quarter reflect our consistent focus on improving relationship profitability across the company's diverse business mix. We reported another quarter of record earnings and generated a return on average tangible common equity of 14.5%, an improvement of 270 basis points from a year ago. Net income of $117 million was up 29% year-over-year, while earnings per common share of $0.33 increased $0.07. These results benefited from higher revenues, well-controlled expenses, sustained exceptional asset quality and a lower effective tax rate. 
Total revenues increased 7% from a year ago and 1% compared to the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, reflecting continued net interest margin expansion. The margin has improved 11 basis points year-over-year as well as 5 basis points linked quarter and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit cost. 
As expected, deposits rebounded in the third quarter, with average balances growing $522 million or 2% from the second quarter. While our deposit costs were up 11 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. 
As we stated last quarter, we remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect market share and client relationships. However, we will remain disciplined and not lead the market in pricing. 
Moving on to loans. Average balances were flat compared to the second quarter, while the period-end balances were down $313 million or 1%. The decrease in the period-end loans is attributable to a $201 million decline in mortgage warehouse lending balances and a runoff of $128 million in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio. Year-to-date, loan growth has been below our expectations, primarily due to heightened competition driven by both bank and nonbank lenders, lower demands and above-average payouts. 
Looking forward, acknowledging the impact of these headwinds, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market, we will not reach our 2018 loan growth goal of 3% to 5% at year-end. However, it is important to note that this shortfall in loan growth does not impact our original full year earnings expectations as we are tracking in line with our other disclosed full year goals. 
Additionally, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. Pipelines at the end of the third quarter are at solid levels, and we expect continuation of positive results across many of our businesses that have performed well this year, including equipment financing and middle market C&I. 
We're very pleased with the performance of lease as it continues to drive excellent growth at yields that are meaningfully higher than the rest of our total portfolio. The addition of Vend Lease to this business at the end of the second quarter has also enhanced these already strong results. In this environment, we continue to emphasize the importance of improving operating leverage as evidenced by a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
We remain focused on growing net interest income and noninterest income as well as tightly managing expenses. We are particularly pleased with our ability to control costs, especially as we further invest in revenue-producing talent and enhanced technology. 
As the financial needs of our clients evolve, they require bankers who understand their complex challenges and serve as advisers to help them achieve sustainable growth. As such, we recently bolstered our commercial banking capabilities with the establishment of 3 verticals: franchise finance, technology and not-for-profit. And we concurrently hired 3 Boston-based senior bankers to lead these verticals. We are pleased to have these leaders join People's United as their in-depth industry knowledge and expertise will deepen our current relationships and attract new ones.
In addition to investing in revenue-producing talent, we continue to make investments to enhance our technological capabilities. Given that the consumer shift to digital channel is evident, we have been tactically driving various digital initiatives and building a foundation to address opportunities. For example, we are actively engaged with multiple fintech companies to establish digital origination channels for deposits, consumer and small business lending and wealth management. We have also invested in a multichannel digital marketing strategy to engage our clients and prospects, generate qualified leads, build relationships and increase sales productivity. 
Over the past year, we have shaped our marketing strategies to embrace our digital and mobile audiences with new technologies, which allow the bank to deliver personalized digital experiences to clients. 
The acquisition of Farmington Bank was completed on October 1, and we're pleased with the regulatory process as well as the speed in which we were able to close the transaction. We are excited about executing in the market as one team and deepening our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. Integration has progressed well, and the core system conversion will take place in January. Experienced teams at both companies have worked closely together to ensure a seamless transition for clients, who will benefit from our full suite of products and services as well as enhanced digital capabilities. 
The addition of Farmington Bank further strengthens the franchise's earnings power as we are confident in achieving the transaction's attractive financial returns. We believe the combination of these 2 customer-focused organizations with similar cultures and complementary commercial and retail capabilities will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the third quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and",1483,"Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $306.4 million increased $5.2 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day, $1.2 million from higher yields and balances in the securities portfolio as well as $500,000 in lower borrowing costs. The largest offset to these increases was a $9.1 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. 
Year-to-date, net interest income is $903.4 million, up $95.3 million or 12% from a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 10% to 12%. Net interest margin of 3.15% expanded 5 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, highlighting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. As displayed on Slide 4, the 5 basis point expansion from the second quarter was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points as new business yields continue to increase and remain higher than the total portfolio yield. Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day, while higher yields in the securities portfolio and lower borrowing costs each added 1 basis point. Conversely, higher deposit cost lowered the margin by 9 basis points. 
Year-to-date, the net interest margin is 3.10%, up 16 basis points from a year ago, and in the middle of our full year goal range of 3.05% to 3.15%. 
Looking at loans on Slide 5. Average balances of $32.2 billion were flat compared to the second quarter, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Growth in average balances for equipment financing, residential mortgage and C&I offset continued declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. On a period-end basis, loans ended the quarter at $32.2 billion, a decrease of $313 million or 1% from June 30, driven by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and the ongoing one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Balances in the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio ended the quarter at $882 million, down $201 million from the close of the second quarter. Importantly, average balances for this portfolio declined only $24 million linked quarter. 
Since the end of the second quarter, a one-off in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio lowered period-end balances by $128 million, bringing the year-to-date impact to $356 million. As such, we now expect runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio for the full year to be higher than the upper end of our previous expectation of $350 million to $400 million. 
Moving on to deposits. As expected, growth rebounded in the third quarter as average balances of $33.1 billion were up $522 million or 2% linked quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, time and noninterest-bearing deposits collectively grew by $711 million, while savings and interest-bearing checking and money market, the average balances declined $157 million and $32 million, respectively. In anticipation of the Farmington Bank acquisition closing, and given their elevated loan-to-deposit ratio, we ran various bank-wide CD promotions during the quarter, which successfully eliminated their loan-to-deposit shortfall. 
On a period-end basis, deposit balances of $32.2 billion increased $742 million or 2% from the end of the second quarter. It is important to note the loan-to-deposit ratio ended the quarter at 97%, an improvement from 100% at June 30. 
As Jack referenced earlier, we continue to focus on controlling pricing as demonstrated by an interest-bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. Specifically for the third quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 57%, while the loan yield beta was 64%. 
Looking at Slide 7. Noninterest income of $92.4 million decreased $2.6 million or 3% on a linked-quarter basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, these results increased $3 million or 3%. The linked-quarter decline in noninterest income was primarily attributable to fee and income tied to lending volumes. Commercial banking lending fees were $1.5 million lower compared to the second quarter, and customer interest rate swap income was down $1.2 million. The largest offsets to these decreases were a $1.5 million increase in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year; and $600,000 in higher bank service charges, primarily driven by the additional calendar day in the third quarter. As a reminder, included in other noninterest income for the second quarter were $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments. 
Year-to-date, noninterest income is $277.6 million, an increase of $12 million or 4.5% compared to a year ago, and in line with our full year growth goal of 3% to 5%. 
On Slide 8, noninterest expense of $241.3 million improved $7.3 million or 3% linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $500,000 of merger-related costs, with $400,000 in professional and outside services and the remainder in other noninterest expenses. Second quarter merger-related costs were $2.9 million, of which $2.1 million were included in professional and outside services and $800,000 within other. 
Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses improved $4.9 million or 2%. As a reminder, included in second quarter operating expenses within the other expense line in the earnings release was $4.1 million of costs associated with 10 People's Bank branch closures. For the third quarter, we did not have any branch closures or related costs. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter also benefited from $1.9 million in lower professional and outside service costs primarily due to the timing of projects. The largest offsets to these improvements were an $800,000 increase in occupancy and equipment cost as well as $700,000 in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting additional employees resulting from the Vend Lease acquisition. 
Year-to-date, noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related cost, are $730 million and tracking in line with our full year goal range of $975 million to $985 million. We continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, as displayed on Slide 9. Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, the efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points, a particularly strong result as beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the metric includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in lower FTE adjustments to net interest income. 
We will continue to emphasize improving operating leverage through revenue growth and controlling costs. We remain diligent in maintaining exceptional asset quality, which is the result of our conservative and well-defined approach to underwriting. 
As demonstrated on Slide 10, originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 57 basis points improved 5 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points from a year ago. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points were up modestly from very low levels in recent quarters and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. 
Moving to returns on Slide 11. Return on average assets of 106 basis points and return on average tangible common equity of 14.5% each increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. Year-over-year, return on average assets improved 22 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was up 270 basis points. We are pleased with the progress we have made enhancing our profitability metrics. As we continue to build the earning power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics. 
Continuing on to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. 
The final slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset-sensitive in spite of rising rates, and we continue to be well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, consistent with the end of the second quarter and up from 43% a year ago. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that the full year 2018 goals we updated in July did not incorporate Farmington Bank. With less than a quarter left in the year, we are not going to provide an update to these goals to include Farmington. However, we wanted to share the following September 30 data points for Farmington. Period-end loans and deposits closed the quarter at $2.97 billion and $2.40 billion, respectively. 
Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

It -- we had line utilization down in the quarter 2, 3 basis points so that, to us, says the customers have cash and they're using it to pay down lines. So some of our balance impact is that. I would say, we look at the economic data and we think things are in pretty good shape, but we don't see increased demand. We certainly have pipelines, and when we think of people looking to expand plants or increase inventory levels they're carrying, we're not feeling like there's a lot of that. So I think there's a lot of things, a lot of -- there's a lot of competition. It does seem to be just okay demand, but not strong given the economic data. And in fact, we saw some lower utilization.
