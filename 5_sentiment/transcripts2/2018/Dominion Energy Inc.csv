267105,548494056,1375347,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, while weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative i",1158,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, while weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results. Adjusting for weather, our earnings results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of return on our Virginia Rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance include lower-than-expected generation capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses. 
EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on Slides 4 and 5. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017. 
GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform primarily driven by an adjustment to our deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase. 
On January 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.318 per common unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29x. 
Also, we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks. 
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. 
We are also in the process of increasing Dominion's credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which will further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we have reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate. Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension and upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we are initiating the process of delevering the parent company and, on a net basis, will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan, excluding our planned SCANA transaction, are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we are committed to our investment-grade readings and will strive to meet the associated credit metrics. 
Moving to tax reform on Slide 10. Recently enacted changes to the federal tax code will have a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion operating in 7 different states. In estimating the ongoing impact for tax reform, we have assumed that the benefits of lower tax rate will be passed through to customers in all of our state-regulated businesses. On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our nonregulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also, the normalization amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side, as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, the tax reform creates some credit headwinds, particularly for companies like Dominion, who are currently not cash tax payers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point, a return to normal weather, one fewer refueling outage at Millstone and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in commercial operation for Cove Point. Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes. 
Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs and share dilution. 
Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8-plus percent if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year. The positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are a return to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing costs, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A. 
You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company will show a decline compared to the prior period even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform in our state-regulated businesses. 
So let me summarize our financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to the federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,548494056,1375347,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017",1122,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our company-wide commitment to improve safety performance. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016 led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations, with strong growth in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016. 
Now a few comments on Millstone Power Station. We are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other nonemitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by [indiscernible] in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy. We have worked with the regulatory agencies, including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual costs of operating 2 dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22 concluded that the solicitation should take place and that Millstone can participate. A recent report from ISO New England regarding the region's future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from [indiscernible] is expected this week, and we look forward to continuing to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and MNR station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. 
The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electric transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade. 
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning hasn't taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward in-service date in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly. We are currently in the process of cooling down to liquefying temperatures to make LNG and commence the final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective, and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence earnings for the first 2 months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefit expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance. 
On January 19, FERC issued a limited notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree felling started for ATP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26. We are making excellent progress, particularly in the mountain areas. Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits, including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits, any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request for authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule completion of the project in the second half of next year. 
It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power prices in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for the increased regional gas transportation at the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project will provide. 
Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. On January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for up-front payments and ongoing bill reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project. We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to the lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Baseload Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by lawmakers and regulators, and we will complete the transaction later this year. 
So to summarize, our businesses delivered record-setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect it to be in service in early March. We received a limited notice to proceed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project and have begun to tree felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day. We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8-plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we've highlighted last call provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, while weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative i",1157,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, while weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results. Adjusting for weather, our earning results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of return on our Virginia Rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance include lower-than-expected generation capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses.
EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on Slides 4 and 5. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017.
GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform, primarily driven by an adjustment to our deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase.
On January 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.318 per common unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29x.
Also, we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. We are also in the process of increasing Dominion's credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which will further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our at-the-market program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we have reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate. Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension and upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we are initiating the process of delevering the parent company and on a net basis will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan, excluding our planned SCANA transaction, are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we are committed to our investment-grade ratings and will strive to meet the associated credit metrics.
Moving to tax reform on Slide 10. Recently enacted changes to the federal tax code will have a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion, operating in 7 different states. In estimating the ongoing impact for tax reform, we have assumed that the benefits of lower tax rate will be passed through to customers in all of our state-regulated businesses. On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our nonregulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also, the normalization, amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side, as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, the tax reform creates some credit headwinds, particularly for companies like Dominion who are currently not cash tax payers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point, a return to normal weather, one fewer refueling outage at Millstone and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in commercial operation for Cove Point. Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes.
Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs and share dilution.
Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8-plus percent if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year. Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are a return to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing costs, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A.
You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company will show a decline compared to the prior period even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform in our state-regulated businesses.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to the federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,548494056,1375385,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017",1129,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our company-wide commitment to improve safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations, with strong growth in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016.
Now a few comments on Millstone Power Station. We are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by DEEP and PURA in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy. We have worked with the regulatory agencies, including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual costs of operating 2 dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22 concluded that the solicitation should take place and that Millstone can participate. A recent report from ISO New England regarding the region's future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from DEEP and PURA is expected this week, and we look forward to continuing to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and MNR station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electric transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete, and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning has taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward an in-service date in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly. We are currently in the process of cooling down to -- liquefying temperatures to make LNG commence with final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective, and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence of these earnings for the first 2 months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefits expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance.
On January 19, FERC issued a limited notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree-felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26. We are making excellent progress, particularly in the mountain areas. Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits, including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits, any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request for authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule for completion of the project in the second half of next year.
It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power prices in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for increased regional gas transportation that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project will provide.
Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. On January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for up-front payments and ongoing bill reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project. We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposals to lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by lawmakers and regulators, and we will -- can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered record-setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect it to be in service in early March. We received the limited notice to proceed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project and have begun tree-felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day. We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8-plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we've highlighted last call provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,548494056,1375427,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative im",1157,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results. Adjusting for weather, our earning results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of return on our Virginia Rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance include lower-than-expected generation capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses.
EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on Slides 4 and 5. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017.
GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform, primarily driven by an adjustment to our deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase.
On January 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.318 per common unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29x.
Also, we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. We are also in the process of increasing Dominion's credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which will further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our at-the-market program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we have reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate. Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension and upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we are initiating the process of delevering the parent company and on a net basis will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan, excluding our planned SCANA transaction, are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we are committed to our investment-grade ratings and will strive to meet the associated credit metrics.
Moving to tax reform on Slide 10. Recently enacted changes to the federal tax code will have a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion, operating in 7 different states. In estimating the ongoing impact from tax reform, we have assumed that the benefits of lower tax rates will be passed through to customers in all of our state-regulated businesses. On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our nonregulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also, the normalization, amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side, as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, the tax reform creates some credit headwinds, particularly for companies like Dominion who are currently not cash tax payers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point, a return to normal weather, one PURA refueling outage at Millstone and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in commercial operation for Cove Point. Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes.
Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs and share dilution.
Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8-plus percent if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year. Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are a return to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing costs, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A.
You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company will show a decline compared to the prior period even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform in our state-regulated businesses.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to the federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,548494056,1375427,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017",1131,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our company-wide commitment to improve safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations, with strong growth in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016.
Now a few comments on Millstone Power Station. We are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by DEEP and PURA in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy. We have worked with the regulatory agencies, including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual costs of operating 2 dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22 concluded that the solicitation should take place and that Millstone can participate. A recent report from ISO New England regarding the region's future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from DEEP and PURA is expected this week, and we look forward to continuing to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and MNR station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electric transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete, and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning has taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward an in-service date in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly. We are currently in the process of cooling down to -- liquefying temperatures to make LNG [ commence ] with final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective, and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence of these earnings for the first 2 months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefits expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance.
On January 19, FERC issued a limited notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree-felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26. We are making excellent progress, particularly in the mountain areas. Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits, including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits, any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request FERC authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule for completion of the project in the second half of next year.
It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power prices in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for increased regional gas transportation that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project will provide.
Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. On January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for up-front payments and ongoing bill reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project. We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposals to lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by lawmakers and regulators, and we will -- can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered record-setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect it to be in service in early March. We received the limited notice to proceed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project and have begun tree-felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day. We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8-plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we highlighted last call provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative im",1157,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results. Adjusting for weather, our earning results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of return on our Virginia Rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance include lower-than-expected generation capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses.
EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on Slides 4 and 5. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017.
GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform, primarily driven by an adjustment to our deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase.
On January 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.318 per common unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29x.
Also, we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. We are also in the process of increasing Dominion's credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which will further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our at-the-market program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we have reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate. Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension and upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we are initiating the process of delevering the parent company and on a net basis will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan, excluding our planned SCANA transaction, are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we are committed to our investment-grade ratings and will strive to meet the associated credit metrics.
Moving to tax reform on Slide 10. Recently enacted changes to the federal tax code will have a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion, operating in 7 different states. In estimating the ongoing impact from tax reform, we have assumed that the benefits of lower tax rates will be passed through to customers in all of our state-regulated businesses. On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our nonregulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also, the normalization, amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side, as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, the tax reform creates some credit headwinds, particularly for companies like Dominion who are currently not cash tax payers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point, a return to normal weather, one PURA refueling outage at Millstone and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in commercial operation for Cove Point. Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes.
Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs and share dilution.
Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8-plus percent if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year. Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are a return to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing costs, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A.
You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company will show a decline compared to the prior period even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform in our state-regulated businesses.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to the federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,548494056,1375559,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017",1131,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our company-wide commitment to improve safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations, with strong growth in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016.
Now a few comments on Millstone Power Station. We are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by DEEP and PURA in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy. We have worked with the regulatory agencies, including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual costs of operating 2 dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22 concluded that the solicitation should take place and that Millstone can participate. A recent report from ISO New England regarding the region's future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from DEEP and PURA is expected this week, and we look forward to continuing to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and MNR station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electric transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete, and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning has taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward an in-service date in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly. We are currently in the process of cooling down to -- liquefying temperatures to make LNG [ commence ] with final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective, and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence of these earnings for the first 2 months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefits expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance.
On January 19, FERC issued a limited notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree-felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26. We are making excellent progress, particularly in the mountain areas. Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits, including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits, any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request FERC authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule for completion of the project in the second half of next year.
It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power prices in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for increased regional gas transportation that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project will provide.
Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. On January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for up-front payments and ongoing bill reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project. We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposals to lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by lawmakers and regulators, and we will -- can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered record-setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect it to be in service in early March. We received the limited notice to proceed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project and have begun tree-felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day. We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8-plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we highlighted last call provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative im",1157,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017, which was in the middle of our guidance range, mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results. Adjusting for weather, our earning results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of return on our Virginia Rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance include lower-than-expected generation capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses.
EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on Slides 4 and 5. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017.
GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform, primarily driven by an adjustment to our deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase.
On January 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.318 per common unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29x.
Also, we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities, and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. We are also in the process of increasing Dominion's credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which will further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.
On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our at-the-market program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we have reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate. Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension and upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we are initiating the process of delevering the parent company and on a net basis will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan, excluding our planned SCANA transaction, are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we are committed to our investment-grade ratings and will strive to meet the associated credit metrics.
Moving to tax reform on Slide 10. Recently enacted changes to the federal tax code will have a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion, operating in 7 different states. In estimating the ongoing impact from tax reform, we have assumed that the benefits of lower tax rates will be passed through to customers in all of our state-regulated businesses. On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our nonregulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also, the normalization, amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side, as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, the tax reform creates some credit headwinds, particularly for companies like Dominion who are currently not cash tax payers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point, a return to normal weather, one PURA refueling outage at Millstone and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in commercial operation for Cove Point. Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes.
Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs and share dilution.
Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8-plus percent if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year. Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are a return to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing costs, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A.
You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company will show a decline compared to the prior period even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform in our state-regulated businesses.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to the federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform. And 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,548494056,1422921,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017",1131,"Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our company-wide commitment to improve safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations, with strong growth in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016.
Now a few comments on Millstone Power Station. We are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for 0 carbon electricity. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by DEEP and PURA in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy. We have worked with the regulatory agencies, including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual costs of operating 2 dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22 concluded that the solicitation should take place and that Millstone can participate. A recent report from ISO New England regarding the region's future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from DEEP and PURA is expected this week, and we look forward to continuing to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and MNR station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electric transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade.
Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete, and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning has taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward an in-service date in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly. We are currently in the process of cooling down to -- liquefying temperatures to make LNG [ commence ] with final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective, and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence of these earnings for the first 2 months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefits expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance.
On January 19, FERC issued a limited notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree-felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26. We are making excellent progress, particularly in the mountain areas. Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits, including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits, any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request FERC authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule for completion of the project in the second half of next year.
It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power prices in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for increased regional gas transportation that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project will provide.
Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. On January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for up-front payments and ongoing bill reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project. We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposals to lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by lawmakers and regulators, and we will -- can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our businesses delivered record-setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect it to be in service in early March. We received the limited notice to proceed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project and have begun tree-felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day. We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8-plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we highlighted last call provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,558269305,1440416,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2018",2018-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant",1352,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant generation business, farmout transactions, growth in our electric transmission and gas distribution businesses, lower operating expenses and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated. The principal negative factor for the quarter relative to guidance was about a 1-month delay in the in-service date for Cove Point. 
GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were a $215 million pretax charge for future rate credits to our electric customers in Virginia, pursuant to recently enacted legislation; and a market loss of $43 million pretax on our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. Our Power Delivery group produced EBITDA of $423 million in the first quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected operating expenses and better results from our electric transmission business drove the positive results. 
EBITDA for our Power Generation group was $748 million in the first quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Higher margins at our merchant generation business, reflecting colder weather; and excellent unit availability was the principal positive factor. The group also had lower-than-expected operating and maintenance expenses. 
Our Gas Infrastructure group produced EBITDA of $612 million in the first quarter, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. As mentioned earlier, Cove Point exports in-service date was about 1 month later than was expected at the time we issued guidance and therefore, made no contribution to earnings in the first quarter and was the primary factor in the underperformance. Partially offsetting the impact were the execution of 2 farmout agreements as well as strong results from our gas distribution operations. Overall, we are pleased with the very strong results from our operating groups. 
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $79.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $75.4 million produced in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $52.1 million, which was 18% above last year's first quarter. 
During the first quarter, we secured a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream to replace their prior credit line with the parent company. On April 20, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3340 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represented 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.23x. 
On March 15, FERC made an unexpected announcement that reversed our long-held policy with regard to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. The decision cost a selloff of MLPs, whereby $30 billion of market value was lost over the 10 trading days that followed the announcement. We and others have filed for expedited rehearing of this issue with FERC. We believe it will take years before FERC's policy change has any impact on Dominion Energy Midstream Partners distributable cash flow, and any change will be immaterial to earnings at Dominion Energy. 
We hope that the MLP market conditions will sufficiently improve to enable us to utilize DM to recycle capital investments in Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which remain MLP eligible and are not directly impacted by FERC's actions. As long as this issue at FERC is unresolved and pipeline MLPs continue to trade at such depressed levels, we do not believe we can access the capital markets for new equity at DM on reasonable terms. 
Therefore, absent a material improvement in the MLP capital markets and Dominion Energy Midstream's market price, we will not be making the previously planned drop-down of a portion of our investment in Cove Point this year. Furthermore, we plan to restructure the incentive distribution rights at DM prior to returning to the market for new equity. 
In the meantime, we will continue to recommend 5% quarterly increases in distributions to the Board of Directors as long as our coverage remains above 1x, supported by strong, stable cash flows from the current assets in the partnership. 
Moving to Treasury activities at Dominion Energy. On our last call, we outlined a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. 
First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. Second, we reduced our planned capital expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. Third, we upsized Dominion's credit facilities to a total of $6 billion and added a $500 million line of credit for Dominion Midstream. 
In light of the in the capital markets for MLPs following FERC's policy changes, we have made a number of changes to our financing plans in order to achieve our financial objectives. Recall we were planning to use the MLP markets to upstream between $7 billion and $8 billion of cash to the parent between 2016 and 2020. A comparison of that original plan and our alternative plan is shown on Slide 8. 
In the alternative plan, financing at MLP is being replaced with debt financing at Cove Point. Both proposals are primarily secured by the same cash flows, which are stable 20-year payments from our Cove Point export customers. We expect to complete the debt financings this year. 
Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to issue an incremental $1.5 billion of common stock later this year, bringing our total for the year to $2 billion. With the exception of about $300 million per year that we plan to issue under our normal DRIP program, this completes our planned marketed equity issuance through 2020. 
Finally, we have targeted some noncore assets for potential sale, including our share of the Blue Racer joint venture. These actions will enable us to achieve our parent company level debt reduction targets 2 years earlier than planned while still achieving our earnings growth targets. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share compared to $0.67 per share earned in last year's second quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the second quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count. 
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first quarter, we now expect to produce results that are above the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Our earnings growth rate estimate also remains 6% to 8% of 2017 through 2020. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share, landing at the top of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance in each of our businesses and a higher benefit than expected from tax reform. We are taking aggressive steps to response to depressed MLP financial markets in light of FERC's unexpected policy change. 2018 operating earnings are still expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with our previous guidance. Our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rates remains 6% to 8% despite the changes made to our financing plans. Finally, with regard to our dividend growth rate, we reiterate our intention to increase our dividend 10% in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to be between 6% and 10%, depending on the viability of the MLP market at that time. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees record-setting safety performance continued through the first quarter of 2018. An all-time loan OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was reached in 2016 then last year, that record was exceeded by an additional 10% improvement to a new record low of 0.60. 
For the first quarter of this year, each of our business segments are meaningfully ahead of last year's record-setting pace. I'm very proud of our company wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first quarter was 98.5%. On March 31, Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet achieved a new company record, operating for 538 days and counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. Previous record was 339 days set in 2012. 
Weather-normalized electric sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% over the first quarter of 2017 led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the quarter, 6 new data center campuses were connected, 3 more than last year's first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've added over 400 megawatts of demand across 16 data centers and expect to continue to see strong growth. 
Now for an update on our growth plans. Cove Point Liquefaction project was declared commercial on April 9. Cove Point is the first export facility to operate on East Coast of the United States and only the second new LNG facility to be constructed nationwide. Construction began on October 2014 following more than 3 years of federal, state local reviews and approvals. At a cost of $4 billion, it is the largest construction project to date for Dominion Energy and is actually the largest project ever constructed in the State of Maryland. It has involved more than 10,000 craft workers with a payroll of more than $580 million. 
Liquefaction facility has nameplate capacity of 5.25 million tons per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 8.3 million gallons per day. All of the export output from Cove Point is fully contracted for 20 years, with a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas and an affiliate of Gale. Cove Point will generate about $700 million of annual EBITDA to Dominion Energy. 
Also during the first quarter, the Charleston expansion project for Dominion Energy Carolina gas was complete and placed into service. The $125 million project included 60 miles of new natural gas pipeline and a new compressor station to deliver 80,000 dekatherms per day to customers in South Carolina. This is the largest expansion project investment in Carolina gas history and the third growth project completed since 2015, when Dominion Energy began operations in South Carolina. 
In January 19, we began cutting trees along the pipeline route to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Despite the late start, we were able to complete tree felling on more than 200 miles of the 600-mile project, which is about 3/4 of our planned miles this year. 
We've also begun to receive approvals to begin full construction in numerous areas, including several compressor stations and other facilities. Just this week, FERC granted our progress to begin full construction on a section of pipeline in the Supply Header project. We have filed with FERC to request full pipeline construction to begin in West Virginia and planned to make a similar filing for North Carolina in the near future. 
A prompt approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file for a notice to proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 84% complete. All major equipment is set, and flushing of the combustion turbines is nearly complete. 
The primary natural gas line and metering and regulation stations are complete and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire this quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. 
We are pleased that Connecticut's procurement for clean energy, including nuclear power, continues to progress. On February 1, Connecticut regulators determined that they will proceed with the solicitation for bids for new and existing carbon-free resources, which includes Millstone Power Station, to meet its public policy goals. Connecticut RFP will be issued by May 1, and responses are expected to be due in September. 
Simultaneously, Millstone has the opportunity to participate in a proceeding determining that it is an at-risk resource. That designation would mean that Millstone's bid will be judged on price and nonprice attributes such as carbon reduction, fuel diversity, economic impacts, et cetera. 
Dominion plans to request at-risk designation, and looks forward to submitting a competitive bid to help Connecticut meet its energy and environmental goals while also stabilizing Millstone's revenue. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our merger with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially reduce the cost to customers in the abandoned nuclear development project. 
We have received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We expect the SCANA shareholder approval this summer and still needs approval from the state utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to lawmakers who are considering temporary changes to South Carolina Base Load Review Act. 
Recent polling indicates very strong support for our proposal within the state, and a recent study by one of South Carolina's leading economists indicated that the state could see more than $18.7 billion in increased economic output as a result of our merger. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators, and we can complete the transaction later this year. 
So to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and safety performance through the first quarter. Cove Point is in commercial operations. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction throughout the entire project later this spring. We are on track to be in service late next year. 
We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. And with our alternative financing plan, we expect to meet our earnings per share growth targets and credit objectives. 
Finally, we have reviewed our dividend growth assumptions with our board and reconfirm our policy to increase its dividend 10% annually in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending upon the viability of the MLP market at that time. 
With that, we will be happy to take the questions."

So why even have this sort of change in language in the outer years, especially since you should be able to maintain it beyond '19?"

If we cannot access the MLP market for those cash flows, then it'll drift into the lower end of that range. If we can, it will be back at the high end of that range. Now why do we keep it at 10% for '18 and '19? Because we have plenty of cash flow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next 2 years. After that, as you say, it's about $100 million. It's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that, that payout ratio we would want to get higher if we can access MLP equity on a long-term basis."

So there is like some sort of pushes and takes here, and you clearly you do have some very strong or incremental growth opportunities like Atlantic Coast Pipeline 2 or 3, renewables.

But you raise a good point, which we haven't heard from investors yet, and that is we were going to utilize and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash flows back to the parent. But if the markets don't open, and we do not do that, all of Cove Point's EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of the decade will be at the parent. That's an incremental $350 million. So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate. We feel very comfortable with the middle, and we'll work toward meeting that as we look like we're able to do this year as well."

In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative financing plan, the majority of it is debt at the asset at Cove Point. And we expect to put that asset between $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year, probably toward the high end of that. That would keep it strongly investment-grade range.

But then you're saying that to get your FFO-to-debt metric, you need just an incremental $1.5 billion of asset sale proceeds. So the $1.5 billion of equity that you did through the forward sale plus the 500 that you did at the beginning of the year plus the CapEx cuts you announced at the beginning of the year plus the 1.5 for asset sales, that total of financing activity you're saying gets you to an FFO-to-debt metric that achieves your credit goal from that perspective?

The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant",1354,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant generation business, farmout transactions, growth in our electric transmission and gas distribution businesses, lower operating expenses and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated. The principal negative factor for the quarter relative to guidance was about a 1-month delay in the in-service date for Cove Point.
GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were a $215 million pretax charge for future rate credits to our electric customers in Virginia pursuant to recently enacted legislation and a market loss of $43 million pretax on our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. Our Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $423 million in the first quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected operating expenses and better results from our electric transmission business drove the positive results. EBITDA for our Power Generation Group was $748 million in the first quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Higher margins at our merchant generation business reflecting colder weather and excellent unit availability was the principal positive factor. The group also had lower-than-expected operating and maintenance expenses.
Our Gas Infrastructure Group produced EBITDA of $612 million in the first quarter, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. As mentioned earlier, Cove Point export's in-service date was about 1 month later than was expected at the time we issued guidance and, therefore, made no contribution to earnings in the first quarter and was the primary factor in the underperformance. Partially offsetting the impact were the execution of 2 farmout agreements as well as strong results from our gas distribution operations. Overall, we are pleased with the very strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $79.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $75.4 million produced in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $52.1 million, which was 18% above last year's first quarter.
During the first quarter, we secured a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream to replace their prior credit line with the parent company. On April 20, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3340 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represent a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.23x.
On March 15, FERC made an unexpected announcement that reversed our long-held policy with regard to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. The decision caused a selloff of MLPs, whereby $30 billion of market value was lost over the 10 trading days that followed the announcement. We and others have filed for expedited rehearing of this issue with FERC. We believe it will take years before FERC's policy change has any impact on Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' distributable cash flow and any change will be immaterial to earnings at Dominion Energy.
We hope that the MLP market conditions will sufficiently improve to enable us to utilize DM to recycle capital investments in Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which remain MLP-eligible and are not directly impacted by FERC's actions. As long as this issue at FERC is unresolved and pipeline MLPs continue to trade at such depressed levels, we do not believe we can access the capital markets for new equity at DM on reasonable terms.
Therefore, absent a material improvement in the MLP capital markets and Dominion Energy Midstream's market price, we will not be making the previously planned drop-down of a portion of our investment in Cove Point this year. Furthermore, we plan to restructure the incentive distribution rights at DM prior to returning to the market for new equity. In the meantime, we will continue to recommend 5% quarterly increases in distributions to the Board of Directors as long as our coverage remains above 1x, supported by strong, stable cash flows from the current assets in the partnership.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. On our last call, we outlined a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. 
First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. Second, we reduced our planned capital expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. Third, we upsized Dominion's credit facilities to a total of $6 billion and added a $500 million line of credit for Dominion Midstream.
In light of the disruption in the capital markets for MLPs following FERC's policy changes, we have made a number of changes to our financing plans in order to achieve our financial objectives. Recall, we were planning to use the MLP markets to upstream between $7 billion and $8 billion of cash to the parent between 2016 and 2020. A comparison of that original plan and our alternative plan is shown on Slide 8.
In the alternative plan, financing at MLP is being replaced with debt financing at Cove Point. Both proposals are primarily secured by the same cash flows, which are stable 20-year payments from our Cove Point export customers. We expect to complete the debt financings this year.
Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to issue an incremental $1.5 billion of common stock later this year, bringing our total for the year to $2 billion. With the exception of about $300 million per year that we plan to issue under our normal DRIP program, this completes our planned marketed equity issuance through 2020.
Finally, we have targeted some noncore assets for potential sale, including our share of the Blue Racer joint venture. These actions will enable us to achieve our parent company level debt reduction targets 2 years earlier than planned while still achieving our earnings growth targets.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share compared to $0.67 per share earned in last year's second quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the second quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first quarter, we now expect to produce results that are above the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Our earnings growth rate estimate also remains 6% to 8% of 2017 through 2020.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share, landing at the top of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance in each of our businesses and a higher benefit than expected from tax reform. We are taking aggressive steps to respond to the depressed MLP financial markets in light of FERC's unexpected policy change. 2018 operating earnings are still expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with our previous guidance. Our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rates remains 6% to 8% despite the changes made to our financing plans. Finally, with regard to our dividend growth rate, we reiterate our intention to increase our dividend 10% in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to be between 6% and 10%, depending on the viability of the MLP market at that time.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees' record-setting safety performance continued through the first quarter of 2018. An all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was reached in 2016. Then, last year, that record was exceeded by an additional 10% improvement to a new record low of 0.60. For the first quarter of this year, each of our business segments are meaningfully ahead of last year's record-setting pace. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first quarter was 98.5%. On March 31, Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet achieved a new company record, operating for 538 days and counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. Previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
Weather-normalized electric sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% over the first quarter of 2017 led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the quarter, 6 new data center campuses were connected, 3 more than last year's first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've added over 400 megawatts of demand across 16 data centers and expect to continue to see strong growth.
Now for an update on our growth plans. The Cove Point Liquefaction project was declared commercial on April 9. Cove Point is the first export facility to operate on the East Coast of the United States and only the second new LNG facility to be constructed nationwide. Construction began on October 2014 following more than 3 years of federal, state and local reviews and approvals. At a cost of $4 billion, it is the largest construction project to-date for Dominion Energy and is actually the largest project ever constructed in the State of Maryland. It has involved more than 10,000 craft workers with a payroll of more than $580 million.
The liquefaction facility has nameplate capacity of 5.25 million tons per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 8.3 million gallons per day. All of the export outpoint -- output from Cove Point is fully contracted for 20 years with the joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas and an affiliate of GAIL. Cove Point will generate about $700 million of annual EBITDA to Dominion Energy.
Also during the first quarter, the Charleston Expansion Project for Dominion Energy Carolina Gas was completed and placed into service. The $125 million project included 60 miles of new natural gas pipeline and a new compressor station to deliver 80,000 dekatherms per day to customers in South Carolina. This is the largest expansion project investment in Carolina Gas' history and the third growth project completed since 2015 when Dominion Energy began operations in South Carolina.
On January 19, we began cutting trees along the pipeline route for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Despite the late start, we were able to complete tree felling on more than 200 miles of the 600-mile project, which is about 3/4 of our planned miles this year.
We've also begun to receive approvals to begin full construction in numerous areas, including several compressor stations and other facilities. Just this week, FERC granted our request to begin full construction on a section of pipeline in the Supply Header project. We have filed with FERC to request full pipeline construction to begin in West Virginia and plan to make a similar filing for North Carolina in the near future. A prompt approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file for notice to proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 84% complete. All major equipment is set and flushing of the combustion turbines is nearly complete. The primary natural gas line and metering and regulation station are complete and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire this quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We are pleased that Connecticut's procurement for clean energy, including nuclear power, continues to progress. On February 1, Connecticut regulators determined they will proceed with the solicitation for bids for new and existing carbon-free resources, which includes Millstone Power Station, to meet its public policy goals. Connecticut's RFP will be issued by May 1 and responses are expected to be due in September.
Simultaneously, Millstone has the opportunity to participate in a proceeding determining that it is an at-risk resource. That designation would mean that Millstone's bid will be judged on price and non-price attributes such as carbon reduction, fuel diversity, economic impacts, et cetera. Dominion plans to request at-risk designation and looks forward to submitting a competitive bid that will help Connecticut meet its energy and environmental goals while also stabilizing Millstone's revenue.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our operative merger with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
We have received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We expect the SCANA shareholder approval this summer and still needs approval from the state utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to lawmakers who are considering temporary changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. Recent polling indicates very strong support for our proposal within the state and a recent study by one of South Carolina's leading economists indicated that the state could see more than $18.7 billion in increased economic output as a result of our merger. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and safety performance through the first quarter. Cove Point is in commercial operations. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction throughout the entire project later this spring. We are on track to be in service late next year. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. And with our alternative financing plan, we expect to meet our earnings per share growth targets and credit objectives.
Finally, we have reviewed our dividend growth assumptions with our board and reconfirm our policy to increase the dividend 10% annually in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending upon the viability of the MLP market at that time.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

If we cannot access the MLP market for those cash flows, then it will drift into the lower end of that range. If we can, it will be back at the high end of that range.
Now, why do we keep it at 10% for '18 and '19? Because we have plenty of cash flow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next 2 years. After that, as you say, it's about $100 million. It's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that, that payout ratio we would want to get higher if we can access MLP equity on a long-term basis."

But you raised a good point, which we haven't heard from investors yet, and that is we were going to utilize and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash flows back to the parent, but if the market is not open and we do not do that, Cove -- all of Cove Point's EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of the decade will be at the parent. That's an incremental $350 million.
So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate. We feel very comfortable with the middle and we'll work toward beating that as we look like we're able to do this year as well."

In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative financing plan, the majority of it is debt at the asset at Cove Point. And we expect to put that at that asset between $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year, probably toward the high end of that. That would keep it strongly investment-grade range. And that only leaves us $1 billion to maybe $1.5 billion on asset sales. So we think it's a very reasonable, conservative number. And we have a number of assets we're evaluating and the one we specifically have mentioned is Blue Racer.
Now, I will say, although we are screening a number of assets, if we don't believe we can get fair value in the market, we're not going to sell the assets. But based on what we've heard so far, there will be a lot of interest in the type of assets we have out there."

We do not anticipate, right now, dropping anything else into DM in 2018 with the current market conditions. And I think it will take FERC a bit of time to evaluate all the requests and rehearing. I don't want to put time frame on that, but that's -- we have made a decision to move ahead on alternate financing for this year. And so I think the earliest we might see a recovery in the MLP market and the DM share price where we would like to be open to drop something in at a fair valuation would probably be next year.
I would say that it's not just the reversal or clarification of the FERC opinion, but DM's market price is going to have to reach a level that makes sense for the parent to go ahead and drop with a lower cost of capital, which has been the design of DM from day one. And so our approach on this is to be patient, to pay the distribution as long as we can and hope that this market opens back up as some clarity comes out of FERC."

The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant",1356,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant generation business, farmout transactions, growth in our electric transmission and gas distribution businesses, lower operating expenses and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated. The principal negative factor for the quarter relative to guidance was about a 1-month delay in the in-service date for Cove Point.
GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were a $215 million pretax charge for future rate credits to our electric customers in Virginia pursuant to recently enacted legislation and a market loss of $43 million pretax on our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. Our Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $423 million in the first quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected operating expenses and better results from our electric transmission business drove the positive results. EBITDA for our Power Generation Group was $748 million in the first quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Higher margins at our merchant generation business reflecting colder weather and excellent unit availability was the principal positive factor. The group also had lower-than-expected operating and maintenance expenses.
Our Gas Infrastructure Group produced EBITDA of $612 million in the first quarter, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. As mentioned earlier, Cove Point export's in-service date was about 1 month later than was expected at the time we issued guidance and, therefore, made no contribution to earnings in the first quarter and was the primary factor in the underperformance. Partially offsetting the impact were the execution of 2 farmout agreements as well as strong results from our gas distribution operations. Overall, we are pleased with the very strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $79.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $75.4 million produced in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $52.1 million, which was 18% above last year's first quarter.
During the first quarter, we secured a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream to replace their prior credit line with the parent company. On April 20, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3340 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.23x.
On March 15, FERC made an unexpected announcement that reversed our long-held policy with regard to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. The decision caused a selloff of MLPs, whereby $30 billion of market value was lost over the 10 trading days that followed the announcement. We and others have filed for expedited rehearing of this issue with FERC. We believe it will take years before FERC's policy change has any impact on Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' distributable cash flow and any change would be immaterial to earnings at Dominion Energy.
We hope that the MLP market conditions will sufficiently improve to enable us to utilize DM to recycle capital investments in Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which remain MLP-eligible and are not directly impacted by FERC's actions. As long as this issue at FERC is unresolved and pipeline MLPs continue to trade at such depressed levels, we do not believe we can access the capital markets for new equity at DM on reasonable terms.
Therefore, absent a material improvement in the MLP capital markets and Dominion Energy Midstream's market price, we will not be making the previously planned drop-down of a portion of our investment in Cove Point this year. Furthermore, we plan to restructure the incentive distribution rights at DM prior to our returning to the market for new equity. In the meantime, we will continue to recommend 5% quarterly increases in distributions to the Board of Directors as long as our coverage remains above 1x, supported by strong, stable cash flows from the current assets in the partnership.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. On our last call, we outlined a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. 
First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. Second, we reduced our planned capital expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. Third, we upsized Dominion's credit facilities to a total of $6 billion and added a $500 million line of credit for Dominion Midstream.
In light of the disruption in the capital markets for MLPs following FERC's policy changes, we have made a number of changes to our financing plans in order to achieve our financial objectives. Recall, we were planning to use the MLP markets to upstream between $7 billion and $8 billion of cash to the parent between 2016 and 2020. A comparison of that original plan and our alternative plan is shown on Slide 8.
In the alternative plan, financing at the MLP is being replaced with debt financing at Cove Point. Both proposals are primarily secured by the same cash flows, which are stable 20-year payments from our Cove Point export customers. We expect to complete the debt financings this year.
Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to issue an incremental $1.5 billion of common stock later this year, bringing our total for the year to $2 billion. With the exception of about $300 million per year that we plan to issue under our normal DRIP program, this completes our planned marketed equity issuance through 2020.
Finally, we have targeted some noncore assets for potential sale, including our share of the Blue Racer joint venture. These actions will enable us to achieve our parent company level debt reduction targets 2 years earlier than planned while still achieving our earnings growth targets.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share compared to $0.67 per share earned in last year's second quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the second quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first quarter, we now expect to produce results that are above the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Our earnings growth rate estimate also remains 6% to 8% of 2017 through 2020.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share, landing at the top of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance in each of our businesses and a higher benefit than expected from tax reform. We are taking aggressive steps to respond to the depressed MLP financial markets in light of FERC's unexpected policy change. 2018 operating earnings are still expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with our previous guidance. Our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rates remains 6% to 8% despite the changes made to our financing plans. Finally, with regard to our dividend growth rate, we reiterate our intention to increase our dividend 10% in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to be between 6% and 10%, depending on the viability of the MLP market at that time.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees' record-setting safety performance continued through the first quarter of 2018. An all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was reached in 2016. Then, last year, that record was exceeded by an additional 10% improvement to a new record low of 0.60. For the first quarter of this year, each of our business segments are meaningfully ahead of last year's record-setting pace. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first quarter was 98.5%. On March 31, Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet achieved a new company record, operating for 538 days and counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
Weather-normalized electric sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% over the first quarter of 2017 led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the quarter, 6 new data center campuses were connected, 3 more than last year's first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've added over 400 megawatts of demand across 16 data centers and expect to continue to see strong growth.
Now for an update on our growth plans. The Cove Point Liquefaction project was declared commercial on April 9. Cove Point is the first export facility to operate on the East Coast of the United States and only the second new LNG facility to be constructed nationwide. Construction began on October 2014 following more than 3 years of federal, state and local reviews and approvals. At a cost of $4 billion, it is the largest construction project to-date for Dominion Energy and is actually the largest project ever constructed in the State of Maryland. It has involved more than 10,000 craft workers with a payroll of more than $580 million.
The liquefaction facility has nameplate capacity of 5.25 million tons per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 8.3 million gallons per day. All of the export outpoint -- output from Cove Point is fully contracted for 20 years with the joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas and an affiliate of GAIL. Cove Point will generate about $700 million of annual EBITDA to Dominion Energy.
Also during the first quarter, the Charleston Expansion Project for Dominion Energy Carolina Gas was completed and placed into service. The $125 million project included 60 miles of new natural gas pipeline and a new compressor station to deliver 80,000 dekatherms per day to customers in South Carolina. This is the largest expansion project investment in Carolina Gas' history and the third growth project completed since 2015 when Dominion Energy began operations in South Carolina.
On January 19, we began cutting trees along the pipeline route for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Despite the late start, we were able to complete tree felling on more than 200 miles of the 600-mile project, which is about 3/4 of our planned miles this year.
We've also begun to receive approvals to begin full construction in numerous areas, including several compressor stations and other facilities. Just this week, FERC granted our request to begin full construction on a section of pipeline in the Supply Header project. We have filed with FERC to request full pipeline construction to begin in West Virginia and plan to make a similar filing for North Carolina in the near future. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file for notice to proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 84% complete. All major equipment is set and flushing of the combustion turbines is nearly complete. The primary natural gas line and metering and regulating station are complete and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire this quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We are pleased that Connecticut's procurement for clean energy, including nuclear power, continues to progress. On February 1, Connecticut regulators determined they will proceed with the solicitation for bids for new and existing carbon-free resources, which includes Millstone Power Station, to meet its public policy goals. Connecticut's RFP will be issued by May 1 and responses are expected to be due in September.
Simultaneously, Millstone has the opportunity to participate in a proceeding determining that it is an at-risk resource. That designation would mean that Millstone's bid will be judged on price and non-price attributes such as carbon reduction, fuel diversity, economic impacts, et cetera. Dominion plans to request at-risk designation and looks forward to submitting a competitive bid that will help Connecticut meet its energy and environmental goals while also stabilizing Millstone's revenue.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merger with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
We have received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We expect the SCANA shareholder approval this summer and still needs approval from the state utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to lawmakers who are considering temporary changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. Recent polling indicates very strong support for our proposal within the state and a recent study by one of South Carolina's leading economists indicated that the state could see more than $18.7 billion in increased economic output as a result of our merger. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and safety performance through the first quarter. Cove Point is in commercial operations. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction throughout the entire project later this spring. We are on track to be in service late next year. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. And with our alternative financing plan, we expect to meet our earnings per share growth targets and credit objectives.
Finally, we have reviewed our dividend growth assumptions with our board and reconfirm our policy to increase the dividend 10% annually in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending upon the viability of the MLP market at that time.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

If we cannot access the MLP market for those cash flows, then it will drift into the lower end of that range. If we can, it will be back at the high end of that range.
Now, why do we keep it at 10% for '18 and '19? Because we have plenty of cash flow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next 2 years. After that, as you say, it's about $100 million. It's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that, that payout ratio we wouldn't want to get higher if we can't access MLP equity on a long-term basis."

But you raised a good point, which we haven't heard from investors yet, and that is we were going to utilize, and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash flows back to the parent. But if the market is not open and we do not do that, Cove -- all of Cove Point's EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of the decade will be at the parent. That's an incremental $350 million.
So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate. We feel very comfortable with the middle and we'll work toward beating that as we look like we're able to do this year as well."

In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative financing plan, the majority of it is debt at the asset at Cove Point. And we expect to put that at that asset between $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year, probably toward the high end of that. That would keep it strongly investment-grade range. And that only leaves us $1 billion to maybe $1.5 billion on asset sales. So we think it's a very reasonable, conservative number.

I don't want to put time frame on that, but that's -- we have made a decision to move ahead on alternate financing for this year. And so I think the earliest we might see a recovery in the MLP market and the DM share price where we would likely be open to drop something in at a fair valuation would probably be next year.
I would say that it's not just a reversal or clarification of the FERC opinion, but DM's market price is going to have to reach a level that makes sense for the parent to go ahead and drop with the lower cost of capital, which has been the design of DM from day one. And so our approach on this is to be patient, to pay the distribution as long as we can and hope that this market opens back up as some clarity comes out of FERC."

The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant",1356,"Good morning.
Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant generation business, farmout transactions, growth in our electric transmission and gas distribution businesses, lower operating expenses and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated. The principal negative factor for the quarter relative to guidance was about a 1-month delay in the in-service date for Cove Point.
GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were a $215 million pretax charge for future rate credits to our electric customers in Virginia pursuant to recently enacted legislation and a market loss of $43 million pretax on our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. Our Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $423 million in the first quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected operating expenses and better results from our electric transmission business drove the positive results. EBITDA for our Power Generation Group was $748 million in the first quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Higher margins at our merchant generation business reflecting colder weather and excellent unit availability was the principal positive factor. The group also had lower-than-expected operating and maintenance expenses.
Our Gas Infrastructure Group produced EBITDA of $612 million in the first quarter, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. As mentioned earlier, Cove Point export's in-service date was about 1 month later than was expected at the time we issued guidance and, therefore, made no contribution to earnings in the first quarter and was the primary factor in the underperformance. Partially offsetting the impact were the execution of 2 farmout agreements as well as strong results from our gas distribution operations. Overall, we are pleased with the very strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $79.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $75.4 million produced in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $52.1 million, which was 18% above last year's first quarter.
During the first quarter, we secured a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream to replace their prior credit line with the parent company. On April 20, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3340 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.23x.
On March 15, FERC made an unexpected announcement that reversed our long-held policy with regard to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. The decision caused a selloff of MLPs, whereby $30 billion of market value was lost over the 10 trading days that followed the announcement. We and others have filed for expedited rehearing of this issue with FERC. We believe it will take years before FERC's policy change has any impact on Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' distributable cash flow and any change would be immaterial to earnings at Dominion Energy.
We hope that the MLP market conditions will sufficiently improve to enable us to utilize DM to recycle capital investments in Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which remain MLP-eligible and are not directly impacted by FERC's actions. As long as this issue at FERC is unresolved and pipeline MLPs continue to trade at such depressed levels, we do not believe we can access the capital markets for new equity at DM on reasonable terms.
Therefore, absent a material improvement in the MLP capital markets and Dominion Energy Midstream's market price, we will not be making the previously planned drop-down of a portion of our investment in Cove Point this year. Furthermore, we plan to restructure the incentive distribution rights at DM prior to our returning to the market for new equity. In the meantime, we will continue to recommend 5% quarterly increases in distributions to the Board of Directors as long as our coverage remains above 1x, supported by strong, stable cash flows from the current assets in the partnership.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. On our last call, we outlined a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. 
First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. Second, we reduced our planned capital expenditures by $1 billion over the next 2 years. Third, we upsized Dominion's credit facilities to a total of $6 billion and added a $500 million line of credit for Dominion Midstream.
In light of the disruption in the capital markets for MLPs following FERC's policy changes, we have made a number of changes to our financing plans in order to achieve our financial objectives. Recall, we were planning to use the MLP markets to upstream between $7 billion and $8 billion of cash to the parent between 2016 and 2020. A comparison of that original plan and our alternative plan is shown on Slide 8.
In the alternative plan, financing at the MLP is being replaced with debt financing at Cove Point. Both proposals are primarily secured by the same cash flows, which are stable 20-year payments from our Cove Point export customers. We expect to complete the debt financings this year.
Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to issue an incremental $1.5 billion of common stock later this year, bringing our total for the year to $2 billion. With the exception of about $300 million per year that we plan to issue under our normal DRIP program, this completes our planned marketed equity issuance through 2020.
Finally, we have targeted some noncore assets for potential sale, including our share of the Blue Racer joint venture. These actions will enable us to achieve our parent company level debt reduction targets 2 years earlier than planned while still achieving our earnings growth targets.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share compared to $0.67 per share earned in last year's second quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the second quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first quarter, we now expect to produce results that are above the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Our earnings growth rate estimate also remains 6% to 8% of 2017 through 2020.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share, landing at the top of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance in each of our businesses and a higher benefit than expected from tax reform. We are taking aggressive steps to respond to the depressed MLP financial markets in light of FERC's unexpected policy change. 2018 operating earnings are still expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with our previous guidance. Our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rates remains 6% to 8% despite the changes made to our financing plans. Finally, with regard to our dividend growth rate, we reiterate our intention to increase our dividend 10% in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to be between 6% and 10%, depending on the viability of the MLP market at that time.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees' record-setting safety performance continued through the first quarter of 2018. An all-time low OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was reached in 2016. Then, last year, that record was exceeded by an additional 10% improvement to a new record low of 0.60. For the first quarter of this year, each of our business segments are meaningfully ahead of last year's record-setting pace. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance.
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first quarter was 98.5%. On March 31, Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet achieved a new company record, operating for 538 days and counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
Weather-normalized electric sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% over the first quarter of 2017 led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the quarter, 6 new data center campuses were connected, 3 more than last year's first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've added over 400 megawatts of demand across 16 data centers and expect to continue to see strong growth.
Now for an update on our growth plans. The Cove Point Liquefaction project was declared commercial on April 9. Cove Point is the first export facility to operate on the East Coast of the United States and only the second new LNG facility to be constructed nationwide. Construction began on October 2014 following more than 3 years of federal, state and local reviews and approvals. At a cost of $4 billion, it is the largest construction project to-date for Dominion Energy and is actually the largest project ever constructed in the State of Maryland. It has involved more than 10,000 craft workers with a payroll of more than $580 million.
The liquefaction facility has nameplate capacity of 5.25 million tons per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 8.3 million gallons per day. All of the export outpoint -- output from Cove Point is fully contracted for 20 years with the joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas and an affiliate of GAIL. Cove Point will generate about $700 million of annual EBITDA to Dominion Energy.
Also during the first quarter, the Charleston Expansion Project for Dominion Energy Carolina Gas was completed and placed into service. The $125 million project included 60 miles of new natural gas pipeline and a new compressor station to deliver 80,000 dekatherms per day to customers in South Carolina. This is the largest expansion project investment in Carolina Gas' history and the third growth project completed since 2015 when Dominion Energy began operations in South Carolina.
On January 19, we began cutting trees along the pipeline route for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Despite the late start, we were able to complete tree felling on more than 200 miles of the 600-mile project, which is about 3/4 of our planned miles this year.
We've also begun to receive approvals to begin full construction in numerous areas, including several compressor stations and other facilities. Just this week, FERC granted our request to begin full construction on a section of pipeline in the Supply Header project. We have filed with FERC to request full pipeline construction to begin in West Virginia and plan to make a similar filing for North Carolina in the near future. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file for notice to proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 84% complete. All major equipment is set and flushing of the combustion turbines is nearly complete. The primary natural gas line and metering and regulating station are complete and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire this quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We are pleased that Connecticut's procurement for clean energy, including nuclear power, continues to progress. On February 1, Connecticut regulators determined they will proceed with the solicitation for bids for new and existing carbon-free resources, which includes Millstone Power Station, to meet its public policy goals. Connecticut's RFP will be issued by May 1 and responses are expected to be due in September.
Simultaneously, Millstone has the opportunity to participate in a proceeding determining that it is an at-risk resource. That designation would mean that Millstone's bid will be judged on price and non-price attributes such as carbon reduction, fuel diversity, economic impacts, et cetera. Dominion plans to request at-risk designation and looks forward to submitting a competitive bid that will help Connecticut meet its energy and environmental goals while also stabilizing Millstone's revenue.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merger with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
We have received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We expect the SCANA shareholder approval this summer and still needs approval from the state utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to lawmakers who are considering temporary changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. Recent polling indicates very strong support for our proposal within the state and a recent study by one of South Carolina's leading economists indicated that the state could see more than $18.7 billion in increased economic output as a result of our merger. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and safety performance through the first quarter. Cove Point is in commercial operations. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction throughout the entire project later this spring. We are on track to be in service late next year. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. And with our alternative financing plan, we expect to meet our earnings per share growth targets and credit objectives.
Finally, we have reviewed our dividend growth assumptions with our board and reconfirm our policy to increase the dividend 10% annually in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending upon the viability of the MLP market at that time.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Obviously, the book ends are stipulated by whether the MLP markets remain broken or not. So what sort of drives the dividend within the band? And more importantly, even at the bottom end at 6%, it's about $100 million in cash flow savings. So why even have this sort of change in language in the outer years, especially since you should be able to maintain it beyond '19?"

And right now, as we said in our prepared remarks that we're not quite sure where that's going to be. So we wanted to put the range out in 2020 that would be kind of with and without the MLP market. If we cannot access the MLP market for those cash flows, then it will drift into the lower end of that range. If we can, it will be back at the high end of that range.
Now, why do we keep it at 10% for '18 and '19? Because we have plenty of cash flow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next 2 years. After that, as you say, it's about $100 million. It's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that, that payout ratio we wouldn't want to get higher if we can't access MLP equity on a long-term basis."

And you clearly -- you do have some very strong or incremental growth opportunities like Atlantic Coast Pipeline, 2 or 3 renewables.

But you raised a good point, which we haven't heard from investors yet, and that is we were going to utilize, and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash flows back to the parent. But if the market is not open and we do not do that, Cove -- all of Cove Point's EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of the decade will be at the parent. That's an incremental $350 million.
So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate. We feel very comfortable with the middle and we'll work toward beating that as we look like we're able to do this year as well."

If you look at the bar chart, it's really not that big a number that we're targeting in asset sales.
In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative financing plan, the majority of it is debt at the asset at Cove Point. And we expect to put that at that asset between $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year, probably toward the high end of that. That would keep it strongly investment-grade range. And that only leaves us $1 billion to maybe $1.5 billion on asset sales. So we think it's a very reasonable, conservative number. And we have a number of assets we're evaluating and the one we specifically have mentioned is Blue Racer.
Now, I will say, although we are screening a number of assets, if we don't believe we can get fair value in the market, we're not going to sell the assets. But based on what we've heard so far, there will be a lot of interest in the type of assets we have out there."

And so I think the earliest we might see a recovery in the MLP market and the DM share price where we would likely be open to drop something in at a fair valuation would probably be next year.
I would say that it's not just a reversal or clarification of the FERC opinion, but DM's market price is going to have to reach a level that makes sense for the parent to go ahead and drop with the lower cost of capital, which has been the design of DM from day one.

Now, the cost to D, in terms of financing, is going to be very minimal, we believe, because the cash flows are the same. You may well get better financing by putting it to asset within the C corp initially before you were to let it travel.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range. The drivers of these positive results for the quarter relative to our guidance include lower operating expenses, a favorable weather and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were an update of the expected coal ash remediation costs and the impact on prior-year results from a FERC capitalization review. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. 
EBITDA for our power generation group was $639 million in the second quarter, which has exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather were the main contributors.
For gas infrastructure and power delivery groups produced second quarter EBITDA of $534 million and $410 million, respectively, both of which were near the middle of their guidance range. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $68.6 million produced in the second quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $49.3 million, which was 21% above last year's second quarter.
On July 25, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.351 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.11x at the end of the second quarter.
On June 29, the Board of Directors of the general partner, our Dominion Energy midstream, exercised its IDR reset election option, pursuant to terms outlined in the partnership agreement. By restructuring by IDR, we expect to extend our ability to recommend distribution increases, while we continue to evaluate next steps for DM. 
Tom Farrell will discuss FERC's recent clarification on the recovery of income taxes by MPL pipelines in a few moments. However, it is the FERC's recent actions [indiscernible] the recent election, changes our previous guidance of [indiscernible] into DM during 2018 while we continue to monitor the sustainability of MLP capital markets.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. 
Execution of our 2018 financing plan is well underway, with continued progress towards achieving our credit goals, as discussed on last quarter's call. The most significant remaining transaction is the $3 billion pocket level financing at Cove Point, which is in the form of a 3-year non-amortizing term loan. This financing is currently in syndication, with commitments for over half of the total already received and the balance will be committed in the next 2 weeks. We expect to close this transaction next month. As a reminder, proceeds of this financing must be used to repay parent level debt.
As to asset sales, we are in the process of evaluating indications of interest for a number of our non-core assets and expect to announce results of that initiative before our next earnings call.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy.
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to $1.04 per share earned in last year's third quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the third quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower soil related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher [indiscernible].
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first half of this year, we expect to produce full year results in the upper half of our guidance range. Our earnings growth rate also remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period.
So let me summarize my financial review. 
Operating earnings were $0.86 per share for the second quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance by our power generation group and higher than expected benefits from tax reform.
Based on the very strong results for the second quarter, we expect to be in the upper half of our 2018 guidance range, and our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,573686753,1516329,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

Our employee's strong safety performance continued through the first half of 2018. I'm very proud of our companywide commitment to industry-leading safety performance. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first half of this year was 95%. Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet has been operating for 660 days and counting without an unplanned reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
We continued to see strong electric sales growth at Virginia Power. Weather normalized sales for the first half of the year were 2.25%, above the first half of last year and have grown at a 1.7% rate for the last 18 months, led by a growth in sales to data centers and residential customers.
During the first half of this year, 9 new data center campuses were connected. Over the past year, we have added over 400 megawatts of demand capacity across 14 data centers and expect to see continued strong growth.
Cove Point Liquefaction entered commercial service early this quarter and has been operating as designed. Customer utilization is high, as evidenced by the more than 60 billion cubic feet of LNG loaded across 19 cargoes thus far. We continue making progress tuning and ramping activities typical for these early months of operation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. 
Construction of the 1,588-megawatt combined cycle station continues on time and on budget. The $1.3 billion project is 95% complete. We have achieved first fire and grid sank of the 1C and 1B turbines and expect to fire and 1A turbine within the next 2 weeks. 226 of 253 systems are in commissioning. The county station is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We have begun full construction on numerous portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply their project, including full construction on all 2018 Supply Header schedule spreads and active construction in all 4 West Virginia Mountain spreads for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. You may have read that we've all carry a requested temporary suspension in water body crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to full compliance with our nationwide permit and have requested this data temporarily to ensure that the Army Corps has the adequate time to review our plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from that review.
Just last week, FERC approved our request to begin full mainline construction in North Carolina and mobilization is already underway. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file a FERC notice for mainline construction in Virginia as well. Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
In regulatory matters, we are pleased that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued its final RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources yesterday in Connecticut. Moreover, we are pleased that the DEEP modified the at risk rest period. By doing so, DEEP acknowledge that an existing resource that is determined to be at risk should have all its attributes valued now. On May 1, Dominion submitted a petition for at risk treatment with the Public Utility Regulatory Authority, which included a full accounting of millstone's financials. We expect Millstone to be granted at risk status, which means the bids will be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as carbon, economic impact and fuel security.
RFP bids for all 0 carbon resources are due September 14, and DEEP is expected to select winners by the end of the year. Winning bidders will execute contracts with the local electric distribution companies thereafter and receive final pure approval early next year.
We're also pleased that FERC responded to a request for clarification of its [indiscernible] statement on income tax recovery for pipelines owned by MLP. In an order 2 weeks ago, FERC reinforces position for commercial contracts -- negotiated rates, such as those for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, are not affected by tax-related recourse rate clarifications. We continued to study other aspects of the commission's revised guidance. While FERC's actions provide some increased clarity, we will need to have more confidence in the long-term sustainability of the MLP capital markets before resuming our drop-down strategy.
Last week, we made our first regulatory filing under Virginia's Grid Transformation and Security Act, the law enacted earlier this year that paves the way for immediate customer savings, expanded investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology, a stronger, more secure electric grid and improved energy efficiency programs. The following requests corporation commission to approve the programs and investments and costs included in the first 3-year phase of a 10-year grid transformation program. The Phase 1 filing calls for over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. In a separate filing, the company will seek to add 240 megawatts of solar energy in Virginia.
The company will soon seek SEC approval for its proposed coastal Virginia offshore wind project. The 12-megawatt facility would be the first of its kind in the mid Atlantic, located in a federal lease area about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. These 2 turbine test projects is being developed with of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind generation.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a customer benefit proposal, including upfront payments and reductions, which would substantially and permanently reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
SCANA has filed a motion to enjoin the South Carolina Public service commission from imposing a temporary rate reduction pursuant to legislation enacted earlier this summer on grounds that it is an unconstitutional taking and of its due process rights. Hearings on the matter were held -- Monday and Tuesday of this week, and we are waiting the judge's decision. The judge stated that she expects to rule soon and before August 7. And yesterday, the merger was overwhelmingly approved by SCANA shareholders with a 98% vote of those voting. We've also received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approvals from the Georgia Public Service Commission and FERC. We will file testimony with South Carolina Public Service Commission this week. We are optimistic that our proposal will be reviewed favorably by regulators, and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize. Our business has delivered record-setting top rating and strong safety performance for the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on-time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction along the entire route later this summer. We are on track to being serviced late next year. Cove Point Liquefaction achieved commercial in-service early in the second quarter and is operating as designed. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. And finally, our operating earnings continue to be very strong, and we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our guidance range.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

The second issue is the one that you referenced, that is the FERC ability to gross up [ 4 ] assets that are held within MLPs. Our structure is a little bit different than enable come but it is a concern to us and it's something we'll be watching very closely.

And our cases are very different in there, and mountain valley is through the layers right now. We have been committed, remain committed to be able to make those crossings in that timeframe to meet the compliance requirement, and we'll continue to do so. Just adding an abundance of caution, we decided that we would request this temporary suspension so that we can have the time to talk that through with the Army core and they can virally review the crossings within our design and our message or compliance within that. With respect to the latest one with mountain valley, there were 2 issues. The BLM, which does not apply to us and then the core our service. While there are certain aspects of the case that was raised in the Atlantic coast appeal also, we do believe the facts and circumstances to be quite different between the 2. And the FERC service, in our case, has conducted a very thorough and rigorous and very transparent review of our impacts. And so we do believe an confident that the agency will proceed with our -- will be upheld -- the approval will be upheld and affirmed by the court in terms of the foreign service issue. And then our final issue is we are continuing to work through this incidental take permit, but the wildlife service helpfully put on record to FERC that it does not impact the majority of our areas including North Carolina, so we received our notice to proceed to our North Carolina last week and are mobilizing there. So we answered questions back to the services. They process our new incidental take permit, and we expect that to be resolved quickly."

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for e-mail alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses our dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measure of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' press release.
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results, financing plan and Dominion Energy's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.

267105,573686753,1516688,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range. Drivers of these positive results for the quarter relative to our guidance include lower operating expenses, favorable weather and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were an update of the expected coal ash remediation costs and the impact on prior year results from a FERC capitalization review. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for our power generation group was $639 million in the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather were the main contributors.
Our Gas Infrastructure and Power Delivery Groups produced second quarter EBITDA of $534 million and $410 million, respectively, both of which were near the middle of their guidance range. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $68.6 million produced in the second quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $49.3 million, which was 21% above last year's second quarter. On July 25, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.351 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.11x at the end of the second quarter.
On June 29, the Board of Directors of the general partner, our Dominion Energy Midstream, exercised its IDR reset election option, pursuant to terms outlined in the partnership agreement. By restructuring by IDRs, we expect to extend our ability to recommend distribution increases, while we continue to evaluate next steps for DM.
Tom Farrell will discuss FERC's recent clarification on the recovery of income taxes by MPL-owned pipelines in a few moments. However, it is the FERC's recent actions, nor the recent election, changes our previous guidance of no drops into DM during 2018, while we continue to monitor the sustainability of MLP capital markets.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Execution of our 2018 financing plan is well underway with continued progress towards achieving our credit goals as discussed on last quarter's call. The most significant remaining transaction is the $3 billion pocket level financing at Cove Point, which will be in the form of a 3-year non-amortizing term loan. This financing is currently in syndication with commitments for over half of the total already received and the balance will be committed in the next 2 weeks. We expect to close this transaction next month. As a reminder, proceeds of this financing must be used to repay parent level debt. As to asset sales, we're in the process of evaluating indications of interest for a number of our non-core assets and expect to announce results of that initiative before our next earnings call.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to $1.04 per share earned in last year's third quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the third quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first half of this year, we expect to produce full year results in the upper half of our guidance range. Our earnings growth rate also remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.86 per share for the second quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance by our Power Generation Group and higher-than-expected benefits from tax reform. Based on the very strong results for the second quarter, we expect to be in the upper half of our 2018 guidance range, and our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees' strong safety performance continued through the first half of 2018. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first half of this year was 95%. Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet has been operating for 660 days and counting without an unplanned reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
We continue to see strong electric sales growth at Virginia Power. Weather-normalized sales for the first half of the year were 2.25% above the first half of last year and have grown at a 1.7% rate for the last 18 months, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the first half of this year, 9 new data center campuses were connected. Over the past year, we have added over 400 megawatts of demand capacity across 14 data centers and expect to see continued strong growth.
Cove Point Liquefaction entered commercial service early this quarter and has been operating as designed. Customer utilization is high as evidenced by the more than 60 billion cubic feet of LNG loaded across 19 cargoes thus far. We continue making progress tuning and ramping activities typical for these early months of operation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. The $1.3 billion project is 95% complete. We have achieved first fire and grid sink of the 1C and 1B turbines and expect to fire and sink the 1A turbine within the next 2 weeks. 226 of 253 systems are in commissioning. The Greensville County station is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We have begun full construction on numerous portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project, including full construction on all 2018 Supply Header schedule spreads and active construction in all 4 West Virginia Mountain spreads for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. You may have read that we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension in water body crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to full compliance with our nationwide permit and have requested this stay temporarily to ensure that the Army Corps has the adequate time to review our plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from that review.
Just last week, FERC approved our request to begin full mainline construction in North Carolina and mobilization is already underway. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file a FERC notice received for mainline construction in Virginia as well. Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
In regulatory matters, we are pleased that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued its final RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources yesterday in Connecticut. Moreover, we are pleased that DEEP modified the at-risk time period. By doing so, DEEP acknowledged that an existing resource that is determined to be at-risk should have all its attributes valued now. On May 1, Dominion submitted a petition for at-risk treatment with the Public Utility Regulatory Authority, which included a full accounting of Millstone's financials. We expect Millstone to be granted at-risk status, which means the bids will be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as carbon, economic impact and fuel security. RFP bids for all 0 carbon resources are due September 14, and DEEP is expected to select winners by the end of the year. Winning bidders will execute contracts with the local electric distribution companies thereafter and receive final pure approval early next year.
We're also pleased that FERC responded to request for clarification of its March statement on income tax recovery for pipelines owned by MLPs. In an order 2 weeks ago, FERC reinforced its position to commercial contracts with negotiated rates, such as those for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, are not affected by tax-related recourse rate modifications. We continue to study other aspects of the commission's revised guidance. While FERC's action provides some increased clarity, we will need to have more confidence in the long-term sustainability of the MLP capital markets before resuming our drop-down strategy.
Last week, we made our first regulatory filing under Virginia's Grid Transformation and Security Act, the law enacted earlier this year that paves the way for immediate customer savings, expanded investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology, a stronger, more secure electric grid and improved energy efficiency programs. The filing requested a corporation commission to approve the programs as investments and costs included in the first 3-year phase of a 10-year grid transformation program. The Phase 1 filing calls for over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. In a separate filing, the company will seek to add 240 megawatts of solar energy in Virginia.
The company will soon seek SEC approval for its proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. The 12-megawatt facility would be the first of its kind in the Mid-Atlantic, located in a federal leased area about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. This 2 turbine test project is being developed with Ørsted Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind generation.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a customer benefit proposal, including upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially and permanently reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
SCANA has filed a motion to enjoin the South Carolina Public Service Commission from imposing a temporary rate reduction pursuant to legislation enacted earlier this summer on grounds that it is an unconstitutional taking and volitive of its due process rights. Hearings on the matter were held Monday and Tuesday of this week, and we are waiting the judge's decision. Judge stated that she expects to rule soon and before August 7. And yesterday, the merger was overwhelmingly approved by SCANA's shareholders with a 98% vote of those voting. We've also received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approvals from the Georgia Public Service Commission and FERC. We will file testimony with South Carolina Public Service Commission this week. We are optimistic that our proposal will be reviewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize. Our business has delivered record-setting top rating and strong safety performance for the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction along the entire route later this summer. We are on track to be in service late next year. Cove Point Liquefaction achieved commercial in-service early in the second quarter and is operating as designed. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. And finally, our operating earnings continue to be very strong, and we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our guidance range.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

The second issue is the one that you referenced, that is the FERC ability to gross up for assets that are held within MLPs.

In that case, it's related to a 72-hour time limit to cross the streams. And our cases are very different in there, and Mountain Valley is through theirs right now. We have been committed, remain committed to be able to make those crossings in that time frame to meet the compliance requirement and we'll continue to do so. Just adding an abundance of caution, we decided that we would request this temporary suspension so that we can have the time to talk that through with the Army Corp and they can thoroughly review the crossings and our design and our message for compliance within that. With respect to the latest one with Mountain Valley, there were 2 issues. There was the BLM, which does not apply to us, and then the Forest Service. And while there are certain aspects of the case that was raised in the Atlantic Coast appeal also, we do believe the facts and circumstances to be quite different between the two. And the Forest Service, in our case, has conducted a very thorough and rigorous and very transparent review of our impacts. And so we do believe and are confident that the agency will proceed with our -- will be upheld -- the approval will be upheld and affirmed by the court in the case of the Forest Service issue. And then our final issue is, we're continuing to work through this incidental take permit. The Fish and Wildlife Service helpfully put on record to FERC that it does not impact the majority of our areas, including North Carolina, so we received our notice to proceed to our North Carolina last week and are mobilizing there. So we answered questions back to the Fish and Wildlife Services, they processed our new incidental take permit, and we expect that to be resolved quickly."

During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for e-mail alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measure of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' press release.
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results, financing plan and Dominion Energy's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,573686753,1531795,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range. Drivers of these positive results for the quarter relative to our guidance include lower operating expenses, favorable weather and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were an update of the expected coal ash remediation costs and the impact on prior year results from a FERC capitalization review. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for our power generation group was $639 million in the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather were the main contributors.
Our Gas Infrastructure and Power Delivery Groups produced second quarter EBITDA of $534 million and $410 million, respectively, both of which were near the middle of their guidance range. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $68.6 million produced in the second quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $49.3 million, which was 21% above last year's second quarter. On July 25, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.351 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.11x at the end of the second quarter.
On June 29, the Board of Directors of the general partner, or Dominion Energy Midstream, exercised its IDR reset election option, pursuant to terms outlined in the partnership agreement. By restructuring the IDRs, we expect to extend our ability to recommend distribution increases, while we continue to evaluate next steps for DM.
Tom Farrell will discuss FERC's recent clarification on the recovery of income taxes by MLP-owned pipelines in a few moments. However, neither the FERC's recent actions nor the recent election changes our previous guidance of no drops into DM during 2018, while we continue to monitor the sustainability of MLP capital markets.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Execution of our 2018 financing plan is well underway with continued progress towards achieving our credit goals as discussed on last quarter's call. The most significant remaining transaction is the $3 billion pocket level financing at Cove Point, which will be in the form of a 3-year non-amortizing term loan. This financing is currently in syndication with commitments for over half of the total already received and the balance will be committed in the next 2 weeks. We expect to close this transaction next month. As a reminder, proceeds of this financing must be used to repay parent level debt. As to asset sales, we're in the process of evaluating indications of interest for a number of our noncore assets and expect to announce results of that initiative before our next earnings call.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to $1.04 per share earned in last year's third quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the third quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first half of this year, we expect to produce full year results in the upper half of our guidance range. Our earnings growth rate also remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.86 per share for the second quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance by our Power Generation Group and higher-than-expected benefits from tax reform. Based on the very strong results for the second quarter, we expect to be in the upper half of our 2018 guidance range, and our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our employees' strong safety performance continued through the first half of 2018. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first half of this year was 95%. Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet has been operating for 660 days and counting without an unplanned reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
We continue to see strong electric sales growth at Virginia Power. Weather-normalized sales for the first half of the year were 2.25% above the first half of last year and have grown at a 1.7% rate for the last 18 months, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the first half of this year, 9 new data center campuses were connected. Over the past year, we have added over 400 megawatts of demand capacity across 14 data centers and expect to see continued strong growth.
Cove Point Liquefaction entered commercial service early this quarter and has been operating as designed. Customer utilization is high as evidenced by the more than 60 billion cubic feet of LNG loaded across 19 cargoes thus far. We continue making progress tuning and ramping activities typical for these early months of operation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. The $1.3 billion project is 95% complete. We have achieved first fire and grid sync of the 1C and 1B turbines and expect to fire and sync the 1A turbine within the next 2 weeks. 226 of 253 systems are in commissioning. The Greensville County station is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We have begun full construction on numerous portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project, including full construction on all 2018 Supply Header schedule spreads and active construction in all 4 West Virginia Mountain spreads for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. You may have read that we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension in water body crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to full compliance with our nationwide permit and have requested this stay temporarily to ensure that the Army Corps has the adequate time to review our plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from that review.
Just last week, FERC approved our request to begin full mainline construction in North Carolina and mobilization is already underway. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file a FERC notice received for mainline construction in Virginia as well. Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
In regulatory matters, we are pleased that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued its final RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources yesterday in Connecticut. Moreover, we are pleased that the DEEP modified the at-risk time period. By doing so, DEEP acknowledged that an existing resource that is determined to be at-risk should have all its attributes valued now. On May 1, Dominion submitted a petition for at-risk treatment with the Public Utility Regulatory Authority, which included a full accounting of Millstone's financials. We expect Millstone to be granted at-risk status, which means the bids will be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as carbon, economic impact and fuel security. RFP bids for all 0 carbon resources are due September 14, and DEEP is expected to select winners by the end of the year. Winning bidders will execute contracts with the local electric distribution companies thereafter and receive final pure approval early next year.
We're also pleased that FERC responded to request for clarification of its March statement on income tax recovery for pipelines owned by MLPs. In an order 2 weeks ago, FERC reinforced its position to commercial contracts with negotiated rates, such as those for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, are not affected by tax-related recourse rate modifications. We continue to study other aspects of the commission's revised guidance. While FERC's action provides some increased clarity, we will need to have more confidence in the long-term sustainability of the MLP capital markets before resuming our drop-down strategy.
Last week, we made our first regulatory filing under Virginia's Grid Transformation and Security Act, the law enacted earlier this year that paves the way for immediate customer savings, expanded investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology, a stronger, more secure electric grid and improved energy efficiency programs. The filing requested a corporation commission to approve the programs as investments and costs included in the first 3-year phase of a 10-year grid transformation program. The Phase 1 filing calls for over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. In a separate filing, the company will seek to add 240 megawatts of solar energy in Virginia.
The company will soon seek SEC approval for its proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. The 12-megawatt facility would be the first of its kind in the Mid-Atlantic, located in a federal leased area about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. This 2 turbine test project is being developed with Ørsted Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind generation.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a customer benefit proposal, including upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially and permanently reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
SCANA has filed a motion to enjoin the South Carolina Public Service Commission from imposing a temporary rate reduction pursuant to legislation enacted earlier this summer on grounds that it is an unconstitutional taking and volitive of its due process rights. Hearings on the matter were held Monday and Tuesday of this week, and we are awaiting the judge's decision. The judge stated that she expects to rule soon and before August 7. And yesterday, the merger was overwhelmingly approved by SCANA's shareholders with a 98% vote of those voting. We've also received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approvals from the Georgia Public Service Commission and FERC. We will file testimony with South Carolina Public Service Commission this week. We are optimistic that our proposal will be reviewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize. Our business has delivered record-setting top rating and strong safety performance for the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction along the entire route later this summer. We are on track to be in service late next year. Cove Point Liquefaction achieved commercial in-service early in the second quarter and is operating as designed. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. And finally, our operating earnings continue to be very strong, and we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our guidance range.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

The first and the largest issue has to do with, is the MLP sector open to equity at all? And based on my knowledge, over the past 8 months, there's only been one transaction done and it was done at a very significant discount for a very small amount of equity. We're a drop-down story and so that market is not open to us and this mechanism doesn't work for us at DM. The second issue is the one that you referenced, that is the FERC ability to gross up for assets that are held within MLPs. Our structure is a little bit different than Enable, but it is of a concern to us and it's something we'll be watching closely. But I have to say, of the 2 issues, market access is the bigger one for us. We've been watching it closely for several months and we'll be talking to both Dominion Energy board and the Dominion Midstream board over the next several months of what the current state of the MLP market is in terms of equity for their consideration."

We have been committed, remain committed to be able to make those crossings in that time frame to meet the compliance requirement and we'll continue to do so. Just adding an abundance of caution, we decided that we would request this temporary suspension so that we can have the time to talk that through with the Army Corp and they can thoroughly review the crossings and our design and our message for compliance within that. With respect to the latest one with Mountain Valley, there were 2 issues. There was the BLM, which does not apply to us, and then the Forest Service. And while there are certain aspects of the case that was raised in the Atlantic Coast appeal also, we do believe the facts and circumstances to be quite different between the two. And the Forest Service, in our case, has conducted a very thorough and rigorous and very transparent review of our impacts. And so we do believe and are confident that the agency will proceed with our -- will be upheld -- the approval will be upheld and affirmed by the court in the case of the Forest Service issue. And then our final issue is, we're continuing to work through this incidental take permit. The Fish and Wildlife Service helpfully put on record to FERC that it does not impact the majority of our areas, including North Carolina, so we received our notice to proceed for North Carolina last week and are mobilizing there. So we answered questions back to the Fish and Wildlife Services, they processed our new incidental take permit, and we expect that to be resolved quickly."

Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.

Our website addresses are dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call, we will discuss some measure of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' press release.
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range. Drivers of these positive results for the quarter relative to our guidance include lower operating expenses, favorable weather and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.
GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were an update of the expected coal ash remediation costs and the impact on prior year results from a FERC capitalization review. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for our power generation group was $639 million in the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather were the main contributors.
Our Gas Infrastructure and Power Delivery Groups produced second quarter EBITDA of $534 million and $410 million, respectively, both of which were near the middle of their guidance range. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results from our operating groups.
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $68.6 million produced in the second quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $49.3 million, which was 21% above last year's second quarter. On July 25, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.351 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.11x at the end of the second quarter.
On June 29, the Board of Directors of the general partner, or Dominion Energy Midstream, exercised its IDR reset election option, pursuant to terms outlined in the partnership agreement. By restructuring the IDRs, we expect to extend our ability to recommend distribution increases, while we continue to evaluate next steps for DM.
Tom Farrell will discuss FERC's recent clarification on the recovery of income taxes by MLP-owned pipelines in a few moments. However, neither the FERC's recent actions nor the recent election changes our previous guidance of no drops into DM during 2018, while we continue to monitor the sustainability of MLP capital markets.
Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy. Execution of our 2018 financing plan is well underway with continued progress towards achieving our credit goals as discussed on last quarter's call. The most significant remaining transaction is the $3 billion pocket level financing at Cove Point, which will be in the form of a 3-year non-amortizing term loan. This financing is currently in syndication with commitments for over half of the total already received and the balance will be committed in the next 2 weeks. We expect to close this transaction next month. As a reminder, proceeds of this financing must be used to repay parent level debt. As to asset sales, we're in the process of evaluating indications of interest for a number of our noncore assets and expect to announce results of that initiative before our next earnings call.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to $1.04 per share earned in last year's third quarter. The positive factors for this year relative to the third quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.
Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first half of this year, we expect to produce full year results in the upper half of our guidance range. Our earnings growth rate also remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.86 per share for the second quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance by our Power Generation Group and higher-than-expected benefits from tax reform. Based on the very strong results for the second quarter, we expect to be in the upper half of our 2018 guidance range, and our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8%.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance. 
Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our 6 units for the first half of this year was 95%. Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet has been operating for 660 days and counting without an unplanned reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.
We continue to see strong electric sales growth at Virginia Power. Weather-normalized sales for the first half of the year were 2.25% above the first half of last year and have grown at a 1.7% rate for the last 18 months, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the first half of this year, 9 new data center campuses were connected. Over the past year, we have added over 400 megawatts of demand capacity across 14 data centers and expect to see continued strong growth.
Cove Point Liquefaction entered commercial service early this quarter and has been operating as designed. Customer utilization is high as evidenced by the more than 60 billion cubic feet of LNG loaded across 19 cargoes thus far. We continue making progress tuning and ramping activities typical for these early months of operation.
Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. The $1.3 billion project is 95% complete. We have achieved first fire and grid sync of the 1C and 1B turbines and expect to fire and sync the 1A turbine within the next 2 weeks. 226 of 253 systems are in commissioning. The Greensville County station is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.
We have begun full construction on numerous portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project, including full construction on all 2018 Supply Header schedule spreads and active construction in all 4 West Virginia Mountain spreads for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. You may have read that we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension in water body crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to full compliance with our nationwide permit and have requested this stay temporarily to ensure that the Army Corps has the adequate time to review our plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from that review.
Just last week, FERC approved our request to begin full mainline construction in North Carolina and mobilization is already underway. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file a FERC notice received for mainline construction in Virginia as well. Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.
In regulatory matters, we are pleased that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued its final RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources yesterday in Connecticut. Moreover, we are pleased that the DEEP modified the at-risk time period. By doing so, DEEP acknowledged that an existing resource that is determined to be at-risk should have all its attributes valued now. On May 1, Dominion submitted a petition for at-risk treatment with the Public Utility Regulatory Authority, which included a full accounting of Millstone's financials. We expect Millstone to be granted at-risk status, which means the bids will be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as carbon, economic impact and fuel security. RFP bids for all 0 carbon resources are due September 14, and DEEP is expected to select winners by the end of the year. Winning bidders will execute contracts with the local electric distribution companies thereafter and receive final pure approval early next year.
We're also pleased that FERC responded to request for clarification of its March statement on income tax recovery for pipelines owned by MLPs. In an order 2 weeks ago, FERC reinforced its position to commercial contracts with negotiated rates, such as those for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, are not affected by tax-related recourse rate modifications. We continue to study other aspects of the commission's revised guidance. While FERC's action provides some increased clarity, we will need to have more confidence in the long-term sustainability of the MLP capital markets before resuming our drop-down strategy.
Last week, we made our first regulatory filing under Virginia's Grid Transformation and Security Act, the law enacted earlier this year that paves the way for immediate customer savings, expanded investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology, a stronger, more secure electric grid and improved energy efficiency programs. The filing requested a corporation commission to approve the programs as investments and costs included in the first 3-year phase of a 10-year grid transformation program. The Phase 1 filing calls for over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. In a separate filing, the company will seek to add 240 megawatts of solar energy in Virginia.
The company will soon seek SEC approval for its proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. The 12-megawatt facility would be the first of its kind in the Mid-Atlantic, located in a federal leased area about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. This 2 turbine test project is being developed with Ørsted Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind generation.
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a customer benefit proposal, including upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially and permanently reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.
SCANA has filed a motion to enjoin the South Carolina Public Service Commission from imposing a temporary rate reduction pursuant to legislation enacted earlier this summer on grounds that it is an unconstitutional taking and volitive of its due process rights. Hearings on the matter were held Monday and Tuesday of this week, and we are awaiting the judge's decision. The judge stated that she expects to rule soon and before August 7. And yesterday, the merger was overwhelmingly approved by SCANA's shareholders with a 98% vote of those voting. We've also received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approvals from the Georgia Public Service Commission and FERC. We will file testimony with South Carolina Public Service Commission this week. We are optimistic that our proposal will be reviewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.
So to summarize. Our business has delivered record-setting top rating and strong safety performance for the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction along the entire route later this summer. We are on track to be in service late next year. Cove Point Liquefaction achieved commercial in-service early in the second quarter and is operating as designed. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. And finally, our operating earnings continue to be very strong, and we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our guidance range.
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

And based on my knowledge, over the past 8 months, there's only been one transaction done and it was done at a very significant discount for a very small amount of equity. We're a drop-down story and so that market is not open to us and this mechanism doesn't work for us at DM. The second issue is the one that you referenced, that is the FERC ability to gross up for assets that are held within MLPs. Our structure is a little bit different than Enable, but it is of a concern to us and it's something we'll be watching closely. But I have to say, of the 2 issues, market access is the bigger one for us. We've been watching it closely for several months and we'll be talking to both Dominion Energy board and the Dominion Midstream board over the next several months of what the current state of the MLP market is in terms of equity for their consideration."

We have been committed, remain committed to be able to make those crossings in that time frame to meet the compliance requirement and we'll continue to do so. Just adding an abundance of caution, we decided that we would request this temporary suspension so that we can have the time to talk that through with the Army Corp and they can thoroughly review the crossings and our design and our message for compliance within that. With respect to the latest one with Mountain Valley, there were 2 issues. There was the BLM, which does not apply to us, and then the Forest Service. And while there are certain aspects of the case that was raised in the Atlantic Coast appeal also, we do believe the facts and circumstances to be quite different between the two. And the Forest Service, in our case, has conducted a very thorough and rigorous and very transparent review of our impacts. And so we do believe and are confident that the agency will proceed with our -- will be upheld -- the approval will be upheld and affirmed by the court in the case of the Forest Service issue. And then our final issue is, we're continuing to work through this incidental take permit. The Fish and Wildlife Service helpfully put on record to FERC that it does not impact the majority of our areas, including North Carolina, so we received our notice to proceed for North Carolina last week and are mobilizing there. So we answered questions back to the Fish and Wildlife Services, they processed our new incidental take permit, and we expect that to be resolved quickly."

Dominion Energy reported operating earning's of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- includes lower operating and maintenance expense, high",1088,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earning's of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- includes lower operating and maintenance expense, higher-margins and our power generation group in better and normal weather. 
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is  a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. 
Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. 
The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. 
And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. 
Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. 
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million respectively. 
On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of [ $0.369 ] per common unit payable on November 15. 
This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for [ 0.2468 ] of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent complex committee to evaluate that offer. 
Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. 
We expect to complete the definitive agreement between the 2 companies this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. 
Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distributions that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy. 
Moving now to our credit and improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps for achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. 
First in September, we closed on a $3 billion [indiscernible] term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing in terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant powergenerating facilities representing some [ 1.8 gigawatts ] of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions. 
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. 
Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure of these assets have become increasingly noncore. 
We are pleased with the results from this initiative and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. 
Cash sales proceeds are being used to reduce parent level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to first reserve and affiliated investment funds for total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn out payment through 2021 based on Blue Racer midstreams ongoing performance. 
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on book ends of potential payments to be received under the earn out structure. 
We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent level debt. 
We wish the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration and successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity, approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreement, with up to $300 billion of additional payment through 2021 and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics to support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to [ $3.10 ] to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance. 
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. 
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

I congratulate Jim on his new role as our company's Chief Financial Officer. Since joining Dominion, Jim has played a key role in our most important strategic and financing initiatives, and I'm confident that he will do very well in this new role. 
Also we should take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick who has been with the company for 38 years, the last 9 of which have been exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best. 
Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the last OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history. 
Exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the southeast United States. 
On the job safety just does not just often. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns from in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, 0. 
Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. 
I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for [ 753  ]days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. 
This represents the nuclear power industries best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael. Represented as the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. 
Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just 5 days. 
Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. 
And during the recent planned outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff in contractors on site. 
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. 
We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a sustainability and corporate prosperity for commitment. that overture performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen. 
Now, I'll turn to business updates. As the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greenful Power Station continues the pace as was 98% complete at the end of September. 
The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. 
We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years, and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility on our solar generation in the United States. 
We'll continue to regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement due solar generation, both at the urging of our states elected representatives. 
Now, on October 16, we filed with the regulatory commission for subsequent license renewable for the [indiscernible] power station reactors. This is an important first step in which we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the [indiscernible] and North Arizona nuclear stations by an additional 20 years. 
We expect to submit the North license suspension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with the [indiscernible] Corporation Commission's for approval construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. 
Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of government pattern in Virginia General Assembly, will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy and environmental protections RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources. 
We have requested that [indiscernible] be recognized as an at risk resource where the contract to sell a portion of [indiscernible] 0 carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both deep and the office of consumer counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public utilities regulatory authority grant millstone at risk designation which will allow millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as 0 carbon, economic impact and fuel security. 
Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects. 
[indiscernible] is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning better be validated by PURA and then entering into contracts with the local electric distribution companies. 
We have been cleared with Connecticut policymakers that the contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for millstone's continued operation. 
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales group. 
2018 year-to-date weather normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classics. 
We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter. 
In July, we filed a grid moderation plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission through the first 3 year phase includes over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. 
And in October, we completed the 1,000-mile of our writer program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground. Improving our ability to respond storm events like Florence and Michael. 
Both of these long-lived investment programs were found to be in the public interest, in [indiscernible] and legislation signed by the government earlier this year. 
As the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. 
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to [indiscernible] underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. 
Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia. 
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation. 
The FERC stop work order in delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. 
As a result, project cost actions have increased the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. 
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phase in service approach with its customers. 
Whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service date for key segments of the project to meet peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. 
ACP will be pursuing a mid 2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. 
Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in cost or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we can't discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers needs and preserve the returns for HCP. 
The supply inter project target in-service remains late 2019. 
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility gas pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing rivals across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers. 
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy's playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers can across the spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms. 
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. 
In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and 1 Dominion Energy. 
Our new core value is embrace change. Which speaks to our focus on adapting our business to the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society. 
This focus on innovation and change will broaden the transform to customer's experience, deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable. 
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration of production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from our heavily commodity exposed ENP a utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies. 
The offer to buy at Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets, and our interest in Blue Racer midstream will further reduce commodity exposure in several of our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing the first set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers, and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of gross capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. 
This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. 
We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014, since we took them public, there has been a gradual but absorbable shift in public capital market support to the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after [ first March 15 ] policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost of service rates. 
Public equity investment, they mastered limited partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. 
In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy's general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. 
For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value or its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. 
In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff as credible for the commission and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing of a number of related matters commenced this morning. 
Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PAC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers we are willing to move forward with that solution. 
We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives and the sale of noncore unregulated assets which further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. 
We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high-end of guidance range for 3 straight quarters and we're continuing to expect the full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. 
The company continued to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. 
We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor average on those topics. 
We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. 
We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. 
And we are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

Dominion Energy reported operating earning's of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- includes lower operating and maintenance expense, high",1088,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earning's of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- includes lower operating and maintenance expense, higher-margins and our power generation group in better and normal weather. 
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is  a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. 
Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. 
The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. 
And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. 
Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. 
Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million respectively. 
On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of [ $0.369 ] per common unit payable on November 15. 
This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for [ 0.2468 ] of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent complex committee to evaluate that offer. 
Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. 
We expect to complete the definitive agreement between the 2 companies this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. 
Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distributions that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy. 
Moving now to our credit and improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps for achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. 
First in September, we closed on a $3 billion [indiscernible] term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing in terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant powergenerating facilities representing some [ 1.8 gigawatts ] of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions. 
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. 
Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure of these assets have become increasingly noncore. 
We are pleased with the results from this initiative and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. 
Cash sales proceeds are being used to reduce parent level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to first reserve and affiliated investment funds for total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn out payment through 2021 based on Blue Racer midstreams ongoing performance. 
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on book ends of potential payments to be received under the earn out structure. 
We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent level debt. 
We wish the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration and successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity, approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreement, with up to $300 billion of additional payment through 2021 and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics to support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile. 
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to [ $3.10 ] to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance. 
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. 
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for [ 753  ]days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. 
This represents the nuclear power industries best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael. Represented as the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. 
Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just 5 days. 
Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. 
And during the recent planned outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff in contractors on site. 
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. 
We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a sustainability and corporate prosperity for commitment. that overture performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen. 
Now, I'll turn to business updates. As the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greenful Power Station continues the pace as was 98% complete at the end of September. 
The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. 
We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years, and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility on our solar generation in the United States. 
We'll continue to regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement due solar generation, both at the urging of our states elected representatives. 
Now, on October 16, we filed with the regulatory commission for subsequent license renewable for the [indiscernible] power station reactors. This is an important first step in which we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the [indiscernible] and North Arizona nuclear stations by an additional 20 years. 
We expect to submit the North license suspension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with the [indiscernible] Corporation Commission's for approval construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. 
Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of government pattern in Virginia General Assembly, will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy and environmental protections RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources. 
We have requested that [indiscernible] be recognized as an at risk resource where the contract to sell a portion of [indiscernible] 0 carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both deep and the office of consumer counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public utilities regulatory authority grant millstone at risk designation which will allow millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as 0 carbon, economic impact and fuel security. 
Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects. 
[indiscernible] is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning better be validated by PURA and then entering into contracts with the local electric distribution companies. 
We have been cleared with Connecticut policymakers that the contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for millstone's continued operation. 
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales group. 
2018 year-to-date weather normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classics. 
We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter. 
In July, we filed a grid moderation plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission through the first 3 year phase includes over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. 
And in October, we completed the 1,000-mile of our writer program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground. Improving our ability to respond storm events like Florence and Michael. 
Both of these long-lived investment programs were found to be in the public interest, in [indiscernible] and legislation signed by the government earlier this year. 
As the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. 
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to [indiscernible] underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. 
Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia. 
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation. 
The FERC stop work order in delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. 
As a result, project cost actions have increased the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. 
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phase in service approach with its customers. 
Whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service date for key segments of the project to meet peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. 
ACP will be pursuing a mid 2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. 
Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in cost or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we can't discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers needs and preserve the returns for HCP. 
The supply inter project target in-service remains late 2019. 
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility gas pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing rivals across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers. 
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy's playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers can across the spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms. 
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. 
In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and 1 Dominion Energy. 
Our new core value is embrace change. Which speaks to our focus on adapting our business to the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society. 
This focus on innovation and change will broaden the transform to customer's experience, deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable. 
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration of production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from our heavily commodity exposed ENP a utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies. 
The offer to buy at Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets, and our interest in Blue Racer midstream will further reduce commodity exposure in several of our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing the first set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers, and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of gross capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. 
This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. 
We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014, since we took them public, there has been a gradual but absorbable shift in public capital market support to the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after [ first March 15 ] policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost of service rates. 
Public equity investment, they mastered limited partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. 
In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy's general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. 
For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value or its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. 
In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff as credible for the commission and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing of a number of related matters commenced this morning. 
Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PAC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers we are willing to move forward with that solution. 
We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives and the sale of noncore unregulated assets which further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. 
We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high-end of guidance range for 3 straight quarters and we're continuing to expect the full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. 
The company continued to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. 
We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor average on those topics. 
We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. 
We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. 
And we are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,585886421,1587910,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher",1076,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher-margins at our Power Generation Group and better than normal weather.
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million, respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.369 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its Independent Complex Committee to evaluate that offer. Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete a definitive agreement between the 2 companies this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distributions that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy.
Moving now to our credit improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps towards achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First, in September, we closed on a $3 billion nonrecourse term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing and terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant power generating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions.
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure of these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative, and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sales proceeds are being used to reduce parent level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to First Reserve and affiliated investment funds for total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn-out payments through 2021 based on Blue Racer Midstream's ongoing performance.
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer, while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team, it is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on bookends of potential payments to be received under the earn-out structure. 
We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent-level debt. 
We wish to thank the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration and successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity; approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreements, with up to $300 million of additional payments through 2021; and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset-level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics that support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent-level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to $3.95 to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance.
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%.
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

I congratulate Jim on his new role as our company's Chief Financial Officer. Since joining Dominion, Jim has played a key role in our most important strategic and financing initiatives, and I'm confident that he will do very well in this new role. 
Also wish to take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick, who has been with the company for 38 years, the last 9 of which have been as an exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best. 
Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history, exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the Southeast United States.
On the job safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, 0.
Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for 753 days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. This represents the nuclear power industry's best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael, represented the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at the peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we restored service to every customer within just 5 days.
Third, the Cove Point liquefaction facility which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. And during the recent plant outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff and contractors on site.
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Board Commitment that [indiscernible] our performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen.
Now, I'll turn to business updates, at the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greensville power station continues to pace and was 98% complete at the end of September. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years and now ranked as the fourth largest utility owner of solar generation in the United States. 
We'll continue to regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement new solar generation, both at the urging of our states' elected representatives.
On October 16, we filed with the regulatory commission for subsequent license renewable for the Surry Power Station reactors. This is an important first step in what we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the Surry and North Anna Nuclear Station by an additional 20 years.
We expect to submit the North Anna license extension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with the Virginia's State Corporation Commission for approval to construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. 
Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection's RFP for procurement of 0 carbon resources.
We have requested that Millstone be recognized as an at risk resource, with the contract to sell a portion of Millstone's 0 carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both DEEP and the Office of Consumer Counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority grant Millstone at risk designation which would allow Millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as 0 carbon, economic impact and fuel security.
Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects.
DEEP is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning  bidders will be validated by PURA and then enter into contracts with the local electric distribution companies.
We have been clear with Connecticut policymakers that a contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for Millstone's continued operation.
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales growth. 
2018 year-to-date weather normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial clients.
We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter.
In July, we filed a grid modernization plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first 3 year phase include over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security.
And in October, we completed the 1,000-mile in our Rider program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground, improving our ability to respond storm events like Florence and Michael.
Both of these long-life investment programs were found to be in the public interest in bipartisan legislation signed by the Governor earlier this year.
At the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply at our projects.
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to petition FERC to be underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. 
Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia.
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation.
The FERC stop-work order and delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project.
As a result, project costs estimates have increased from a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs.
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phase in service approach with its customers. 
Whereby, we maintain a late 2019 in-service dates for key segments of the project to meet peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. 
ACP will be pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. 
Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in costs or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we can't discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers' needs and preserve the returns for ACP.
The Supply Header project target in-service remains late 2019.
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility gas pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing Riders across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers.
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy is playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers and across a spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms.
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. 
In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and One Dominion Energy. 
Our new core value is embrace change, which speaks to our focus on adapting our business with the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society.
This focus on innovation and change will drive us to transform the customer experience, and deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable.
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration and production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from a heavily commodity exposed E&P and utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies.
The offer to buy in Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets, and our interest in Blue Racer Midstream will further reduce commodity exposure and simplify our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing a diverse set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers, and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of growth capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion Midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014. Since we took them public, there has been a gradual but observable shift in public capital market support to the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after FERC's March 15 policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost-of-service rates. 
Public equity investment, the Master Limited Partnership this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy as general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion Midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value for its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff that is currently before the commission, and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing on a number of related matters commenced this morning. Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PSC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative, and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers, we're willing to move forward with that solution. We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives, and the sale of our noncore unregulated assets will further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high-end of our guidance range for 3 straight quarters, and we continue to expect that full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. The company continues to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor outreach on those topics. We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. And we are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

267105,585886421,1601743,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher",1073,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins at our Power Generation Group and better-than-normal weather.
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million, respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3690 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent conflicts committee to evaluate that offer. Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete a definitive agreement between the 2 companies in this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distribution that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy.
Moving now to our credit improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps towards achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First, in September, we closed on a $3 billion nonrecourse term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing and terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant power generating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions.
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure, these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative, and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sale proceeds are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to First Reserve and affiliated investment funds for a total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn-out payments through 2021 based on Blue Racer Midstream's ongoing performance.
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer, while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team, is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on bookends of potential payments to be received under the earn-out structure. We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent-level debt. 
We wish to thank the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration in successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent-level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity; approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreements, with up to $300 million of additional payments through 2021; and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset-level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics that support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent-level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar-related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to $3.95 to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance.
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%.
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Since joining Dominion, Jim has played a key role in our most important strategic and financing initiatives. I'm confident that he will do very well in this new role. 
Also wish to take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick, who has been with the company for 38 years, the last 9 of which have been as an exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best. 
Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history, exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the Southeast United States.
On-the-job safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, 0.
Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for 753 days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. This represents the nuclear power industry's best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael, represented the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just 5 days.
Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility, which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history, has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. And during the recent plant outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff and contractors on-site.
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board-level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Board [Audio Gap] our performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen.
Now I'll turn to business updates. At the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greensville power station continues to pace and was 98% complete at the end of September. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility-scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility owner of solar generation in the United States. 
We will continue to add regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement new solar generation, both at the urging of our state's elected representatives.
On October 16, we filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for subsequent license renewal for the Surry Power Station reactors. This is an important first step in what we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the Surry and North Anna Nuclear Station by an additional 20 years.
We expect to submit the North Anna license extension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission for approval to construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection's RFP for procurement of zero-carbon resources. We have requested that Millstone be recognized as an at-risk resource, with a contract to sell a portion of Millstone's zero-carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both DEEP and the Office of Consumer Counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority grant Millstone at-risk designation which would allow Millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as zero-carbon, economic impact and fuel security. Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects.
DEEP is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning bidders will be validated by PURA and then enter into contracts with the local electric distribution companies.
We have been clear with Connecticut policymakers that a contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for Millstone's continued operation.
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales growth. 2018 year-to-date weather-normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classes. We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter.
In July, we filed a grid modernization plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, for the first 3-year phase include over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security.
And in October, we completed the 1,000 mile in our Rider program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground, improving our ability to respond to storm events like Florence and Michael. Both of these long-life investment programs were found to be in the public interest in bipartisan legislation signed by the Governor earlier this year.
At the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply at our projects.
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to petition FERC to be underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia.
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation.
The FERC stop-work order and delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, project costs estimates have increased from a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. 
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phased in-service approach with its customers, whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service dates for key segments of the project to meet the peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. ACP will be pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in costs or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we cannot discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers' needs and preserve the returns for ACP.
The Supply Header project target in-service remains late 2019.
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing Riders across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers.
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy is playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers and across a spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms. 
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and One Dominion Energy. Our new core value is embrace change, which speaks to our focus on adapting our business with the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society.
This focus on innovation and change will drive us to transform the customer experience and deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable.
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration and production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from a heavily commodity exposed E&P and utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies.
The offer to buy Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets and our interest in Blue Racer Midstream will further reduce commodity exposure and simplify our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing a diverse set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of growth capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion Midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014. Since we took them public, there has been a gradual but observable shift in public capital market support for the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after FERC's March 15 policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost-of-service rates. Public equity investment in Master Limited Partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. 
In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy as general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion Midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value for its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff that is currently before the commission, and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing on a number of related matters commenced this morning. Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PSC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative, and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers, we're willing to move forward with that solution. We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives, and the sale of noncore unregulated assets will further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high end of our guidance range for 3 straight quarters, and we continue to expect that full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. 
The company continues to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor outreach on those topics. 
We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. And we're optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

So if Blue Racer revenues and EBITDA grow over that time period above some reasonable threshold, we participate in that every year, participate in that growth up to that $300 million maximum level. So very happy. As it relates to our credit profile, we are using the upfront proceeds this year to repay parent company debt. I think that brings us to where we need to be on a credit basis already.

267105,585886421,1601968,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher",1073,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins at our Power Generation Group and better-than-normal weather.
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million, respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3690 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent conflicts committee to evaluate that offer. Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete a definitive agreement between the 2 companies in this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distribution that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy.
Moving now to our credit improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps towards achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First, in September, we closed on a $3 billion nonrecourse term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing and terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant power generating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions.
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure, these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative, and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sale proceeds are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to First Reserve and affiliated investment funds for a total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn-out payments through 2021 based on Blue Racer Midstream's ongoing performance.
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer, while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team, is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on bookends of potential payments to be received under the earn-out structure. We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent-level debt. 
We wish to thank the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration in successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent-level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity; approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreements, with up to $300 million of additional payments through 2021; and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset-level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics that support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent-level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar-related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to $3.95 to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance.
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%.
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Since joining Dominion, Jim has played a key role in our most important strategic and financing initiatives. I'm confident that he will do very well in this new role. 
Also wish to take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick, who has been with the company for 38 years, the last 9 of which have been as an exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best. 
Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history, exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the Southeast United States.
On-the-job safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, 0.
Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for 753 days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. This represents the nuclear power industry's best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael, represented the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just 5 days.
Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility, which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history, has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. And during the recent plant outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff and contractors on-site.
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board-level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Board [Audio Gap] our performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen.
Now I'll turn to business updates. At the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greensville power station continues to pace and was 98% complete at the end of September. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility-scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility owner of solar generation in the United States. 
We will continue to add regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement new solar generation, both at the urging of our state's elected representatives.
On October 16, we filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for subsequent license renewal for the Surry Power Station reactors. This is an important first step in what we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the Surry and North Anna Nuclear Station by an additional 20 years.
We expect to submit the North Anna license extension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission for approval to construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection's RFP for procurement of zero-carbon resources. We have requested that Millstone be recognized as an at-risk resource, with a contract to sell a portion of Millstone's zero-carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both DEEP and the Office of Consumer Counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority grant Millstone at-risk designation which would allow Millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as zero-carbon, economic impact and fuel security. Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects.
DEEP is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning bidders will be validated by PURA and then enter into contracts with the local electric distribution companies.
We have been clear with Connecticut policymakers that a contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for Millstone's continued operation.
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales growth. 2018 year-to-date weather-normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classes. We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter.
In July, we filed a grid modernization plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, for the first 3-year phase include over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security.
And in October, we completed the 1,000 mile in our Rider program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground, improving our ability to respond to storm events like Florence and Michael. Both of these long-life investment programs were found to be in the public interest in bipartisan legislation signed by the Governor earlier this year.
At the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply at our projects.
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to petition FERC to be underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia.
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation.
The FERC stop-work order and delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, project costs estimates have increased from a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. 
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phased in-service approach with its customers, whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service dates for key segments of the project to meet the peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. ACP will be pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in costs or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we cannot discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers' needs and preserve the returns for ACP.
The Supply Header project target in-service remains late 2019.
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing Riders across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers.
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy is playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers and across a spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms. 
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and One Dominion Energy. Our new core value is embrace change, which speaks to our focus on adapting our business with the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society.
This focus on innovation and change will drive us to transform the customer experience and deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable.
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration and production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from a heavily commodity exposed E&P and utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies.
The offer to buy Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets and our interest in Blue Racer Midstream will further reduce commodity exposure and simplify our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing a diverse set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of growth capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion Midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014. Since we took them public, there has been a gradual but observable shift in public capital market support for the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after FERC's March 15 policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost-of-service rates. Public equity investment in Master Limited Partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. 
In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy as general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion Midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value for its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff that is currently before the commission, and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing on a number of related matters commenced this morning. Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PSC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative, and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers, we're willing to move forward with that solution. We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives, and the sale of noncore unregulated assets will further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high end of our guidance range for 3 straight quarters, and we continue to expect that full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. 
The company continues to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor outreach on those topics. 
We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. And we're optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

So if Blue Racer revenues and EBITDA grow over that time period above some reasonable threshold, we participate in that every year, participate in that growth up to that $300 million maximum level. So very happy. As it relates to our credit profile, we are using the upfront proceeds this year to repay parent company debt. I think that brings us to where we need to be on a credit basis already.

267105,585886421,1601976,"Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP, Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2018",2018-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher",1073,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. 
Drivers relative to our guidance including -- include lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins at our Power Generation Group and better-than-normal weather.
GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. 
Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million, respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3690 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. 
On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. 
The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent conflicts committee to evaluate that offer. Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete a definitive agreement between the 2 companies in this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. 
We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distribution that was declared on October 19. 
Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy.
Moving now to our credit improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps towards achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First, in September, we closed on a $3 billion nonrecourse term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing and terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in 3 merchant power generating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across 2 transactions.
We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure, these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative, and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sale proceeds are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to First Reserve and affiliated investment funds for a total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment -- earn-out payments through 2021 based on Blue Racer Midstream's ongoing performance.
We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer, while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team, is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure. 
This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on bookends of potential payments to be received under the earn-out structure. We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent-level debt. 
We wish to thank the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration in successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. 
To summarize, we have forced -- we have sourced funds to reduce our parent-level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity; approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreements, with up to $300 million of additional payments through 2021; and $3 billion of -- $3 billion from the Cove Point asset-level financing. 
As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics that support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent-level debt to total debt metric 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile.
Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. 
Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. 
Negative factors include lower solar-related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count. 
Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to $3.95 to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance.
Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%.
Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Also wish to take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick, who has been with the company for 38 years, the last 9 of which have been as an exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best. 
Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history, exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the Southeast United States.
On-the-job safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, 0.
Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. I'd like to share 4 examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for 753 days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. This represents the nuclear power industry's best fleet performance. 
Second, Hurricane Michael, represented the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1/4 of our electric customers. Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just 5 days.
Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility, which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history, has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service. And during the recent plant outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff and contractors on-site.
Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. 
At Dominion, ESG is a board-level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Board [Audio Gap] our performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen.
Now I'll turn to business updates. At the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greensville power station continues to pace and was 98% complete at the end of September. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December. 
We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility-scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility owner of solar generation in the United States. 
We will continue to add regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement new solar generation, both at the urging of our state's elected representatives.
On October 16, we filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for subsequent license renewal for the Surry Power Station reactors. This is an important first step in what we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the Surry and North Anna Nuclear Station by an additional 20 years.
We expect to submit the North Anna license extension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. 
We've also filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission for approval to construct 2 offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract. Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. 
Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection's RFP for procurement of zero-carbon resources. We have requested that Millstone be recognized as an at-risk resource, with a contract to sell a portion of Millstone's zero-carbon power starting July 1, 2019. 
We are pleased that both DEEP and the Office of Consumer Counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority grant Millstone at-risk designation which would allow Millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as zero-carbon, economic impact and fuel security. Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects.
DEEP is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning bidders will be validated by PURA and then enter into contracts with the local electric distribution companies.
We have been clear with Connecticut policymakers that a contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for Millstone's continued operation.
At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales growth. 2018 year-to-date weather-normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classes. We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter.
In July, we filed a grid modernization plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, for the first 3-year phase include over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security.
And in October, we completed the 1,000 mile in our Rider program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground, improving our ability to respond to storm events like Florence and Michael. Both of these long-life investment programs were found to be in the public interest in bipartisan legislation signed by the Governor earlier this year.
At the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply at our projects.
We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to petition FERC to be underway with full mainline construction in all 3 states. Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia.
We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation.
The FERC stop-work order and delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, project costs estimates have increased from a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. 
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phased in-service approach with its customers, whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service dates for key segments of the project to meet the peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. ACP will be pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. Abnormal weather and/or work delays may result in costs or schedule modifications in the future. 
We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we cannot discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers' needs and preserve the returns for ACP.
The Supply Header project target in-service remains late 2019.
Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing Riders across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers.
We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy is playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers and across a spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms. 
We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and One Dominion Energy. Our new core value is embrace change, which speaks to our focus on adapting our business with the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society.
This focus on innovation and change will drive us to transform the customer experience and deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable.
Several years ago, when we divested our exploration and production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from a heavily commodity exposed E&P and utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies.
The offer to buy Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets and our interest in Blue Racer Midstream will further reduce commodity exposure and simplify our business model. 
We have identified and are actively developing a diverse set of regulated growth plans -- growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of growth capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade. 
Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion Midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014. Since we took them public, there has been a gradual but observable shift in public capital market support for the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after FERC's March 15 policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost-of-service rates. Public equity investment in Master Limited Partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising. 
In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy as general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion Midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value for its underlying assets. 
Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff that is currently before the commission, and which we expect will be approved in December. 
In South Carolina, the hearing on a number of related matters commenced this morning. Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PSC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative, and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers, we're willing to move forward with that solution. We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. 
In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives, and the sale of noncore unregulated assets will further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative. We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at/or above the high end of our guidance range for 3 straight quarters, and we continue to expect that full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. 
The company continues to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor outreach on those topics. 
We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade. We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. And we're optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

So if Blue Racer revenues and EBITDA grow over that time period above some reasonable threshold, we participate in that every year, participate in that growth up to that $300 million maximum level. So very happy. As it relates to our credit profile, we are using the upfront proceeds this year to repay parent company debt. I think that brings us to where we need to be on a credit basis already.

But obviously interested in the outcome of that lawsuit as well as what's going on at the Public Service Commission. So all of these things have to be resolved without affecting financial parameters that we entered into -- the original financial parameters we entered into with SCANA in January, or we won't close. I'm optimistic that, that will all -- we will work our way through all of it, and we will close by the end of the year."

And it became apparent to us that there was a significant interest by many in moving the refund into more of a rate -- an ongoing rate reduction. So we worked through that and came up with a proposal that you saw us put forward, I guess, this last week. Things are all sort of running together, but I guess it was last week we put that proposal up. But that's all. There's 2 proposals, either one we're comfortable with. We don't expect any changes to either one of them."
