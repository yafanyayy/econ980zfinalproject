The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality",1472,"Thank you, Mike. The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality, high integrity news.
Second quarter revenues grew 3% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA was up 1% to $329 million. First half revenues were up 4% and reported segment EBITDA rose 27%.
Clearly, there are profound changes taking place in the creation and the distribution of digital content. The big tech disruptors are in the midst of a particularly disruptive period commercially, socially and politically. We appreciate that Google has ended the prejudicial First Click Free and that Facebook is prioritizing provenance, but these are modest steps towards changing a digital environment that is dysfunctional and sometimes dystopian. With the support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the clear backing of the News Corp board, our company has long been the strongest international advocate of necessary changes to this landscape.
It is certainly in the interest of our shareholders that there be a digital reorientation towards quality and integrity and that more people are encouraged to pay for professional journalism. There is a social and commercial value to journalism, but that value needs to be valued by the digital publishing platforms. The bot-infested Badlands are hardly a safe space for advertisers, whose brands are being tarnished by association with the extreme, the violent and the repulsive.
Now let's get into the details of this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which once again reported a strong quarter with 21% revenue growth and 25% EBITDA growth, solidifying its role as a significant engine of expansion at News Corp. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, revenues rose by 18% and core real estate revenues expended by a healthy 22%. Realtors Connections for Buyers products continues to thrive, with accelerated traffic growth as well as a continued boost in customer and lead volume in the second quarter. There's an ongoing drive to increase the profile of realtor.com as we have the highest consumer engagement and highest ROI for agents and brokers based on our latest records.
We're also making a concerted push in the New York market with an emphasis on having the most extensive listings and always enlightening editorial. The realtor.com roadmap includes enhancements to our software and services products, which we believe provide best-in-class leads for brokers and the most comprehensive suite of essential tools. Realtor.com will also continue to focus on driving engagement with My Home, which extends usage beyond search and discovery and allows owners to claim their home online and provides data that will be the basis of added value adjacencies. 
REA maintains a healthy lead over its stumbling competitor in Australia's digital real estate market with 24% revenue growth year-over-year. Since the launch of Home Loans, which is part of the company's broader expansion into financial services, REA had over 150,000 self-completed financial profiles by the end of January. Traffic continued to expand this quarter with REA maintaining a sizable lead over the #2 player in the market. 
We saw yet another strong quarter in Book Publishing, a solid EBITDA growth at HarperCollins through our bigger sales from our children [indiscernible] and for Bad Dad by the multitalented David Williams in the U.K. Meanwhile, the success of Pioneer Woman Cooks recipe book was yet another indicator of the power of America's high plan audience. 
We're excited by the early success of Ajay debut novel, The Woman in the Window, which came out in January, and the ongoing success of the Subtle Art of Not Giving An Expletive. We continue to look for ways to leverage our unique titles and creativity. As announced during this past quarter, Amazon plans to license The Lord of the Rings rights for the creation of an original television series, underscoring the great value of our backlist. As J.R.R. Tolkien himself wrote, ""still around the corner, they may wait a new road or secret gate.""
The performance of the News and Information Services segment was relatively stable, with notable improvements in profit contribution from the U.K. and Australia. At Dow Jones, circulation revenue growth remained robust with a 10% increase year-over-year. We are nearing the short-term goal of 3 million total subscribers, with 2.8 million subscribers to Dow Jones consumer products in the quarter. 
The Wall Street Journal experienced an approximate 12% increase in circulation revenues year-over-year. Meanwhile, our professional information business is muscular, powered by risk and compliance, which grew over 40% this quarter. Companies simply must invest in reducing risk and enhancing compliance, and Dow Jones has the necessary tools in both of these imperative areas.
At the New York Post, digital ad growth was a robust 35% and represents 60% of total ad revenues in the quarter. This quarter, we launched News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, which has authenticated audiences and the highest-quality journalism and content in the U.S. There is keen interest in leveraging our first-party data and brand-enhancing environments, which are in stark contrast to the tainted placements on so many digital platforms.
The power of News IQ also comes from concentrated collaboration across many of our business units, which will intensify as we drive our advertising business in the U.S. and pursue longer-term bonds of global expansion.
At News UK, we saw modest growth for the first time since 2011, driven by emerging digital ad revenue growth at The Sun where there were over 90 million global average monthly uniques in the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to see improved engagement in the U.K. audience, highlighted by higher page views and minutes per session, according to comScore data.
The increasingly popular Sun Savers program, which grew to more than 490,000 registrations as of this week, is expected to generate higher levels of engagement. It is also allowing us to get the permission data on readers, traditionally difficult for a paper with strong newsstand sales. Meanwhile, The Times and Sun data continue to gain market share and digital subscribers grew 20% versus the prior year.
At Wireless Group, we saw improvement in revenues at its stations -- and its stations extended their reach and listening hours. Wireless is now home to 2 of the U.K.'s fastest growing stations, led by Virgin Radio, which grew its reach by over 60% year-over-year based on the latest independent data and talkSPORT 2, up about 40% in reach during the same period. 
It is worth noting that Unruly had its best quarter ever in terms of total revenue, led by particular buoyant growth in the U.S. As announced last week, the astute and acute Norm Johnson is assuming CEO role at Unruly, and co-Founder Sarah Wood will become chair of the Unruly board and continue to exercise a positive influence.
News Corp Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher with an audience of approximately 16 million per month. We saw an acceleration in digital advertising revenue growth, reflecting several changes in the sales structure that better aligned our teams with the evolving need of advertising. And we remain focused on cost management initiatives to improve operating efficiency, resulting in higher contribution to profitability. 
Susan, who has just returned from Australia, will shortly elaborate on these positive developments. The Australian continued to grow digital subscribers, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time. Significantly more than 50% of its paid weekday volume is now digital.
On the proposed combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports, we received both ACCC and FERB approvals and are in the process of finalizing what is a complex arrangement with Telstra. That focus has given us an opportunity to begin the reshaping of the 2 companies, and the first step was the appointment of a new Foxtel CEO, the excellent Patrick Delaney. We would like to thank his predecessor, Peter Turner, for his sterling contribution during a transitional period and to News Corp over many years.
Once again, this strong quarter showcased the benefits of News Corp's digital strategy, the value of being disciplined on cost and the efficacy of ever-increasing cooperation among our companies.
Before I turn the platform over to Susan to expand on our results, 1 final word about taxes. Passage of tax reform in the United States should be beneficial to our company and our people, our investors and our customers. At the founding of the new news, we had strong confidence in the potential for U.S. growth. We have invested significantly in U.S. digital real estate and U.S. Book Publishing, for example, and expect to reap even greater rewards, thanks to the tax reform program, which will make the country a better place to do business and creates more opportunities for all Americans. And now over to Susan."
212741644,549818954,1384676,"News Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-08,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials, we delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Rea",1841,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials, we delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $329 million, up from $325 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, earnings per share were a loss of $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.50 in the prior year. This quarter's results include a charge related to the remission of the deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. I'll discuss in a few moments the expected impact from the U.S. tax reform going forward.
You may recall the prior year period included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million related to The Australian publishing division fixed assets and a $227 million pretax noncash write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes both items and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, were $0.24 compared to $0.19 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. The acquisition of Australian Regional Media or ARM and foreign exchange contributed $30 million and $33 million, respectively, this quarter.
Within segment revenues, advertising was down 6% and circulation and subscription revenues increased [ 6% ] Within our core news businesses, Dow Jones revenues rose 1%, News U.K. grew by 7% and News Australia grew by 4%. These increases were offset by a 16% decline at News America Marketing as we flagged during the last earnings call. More revenue data will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
Segment EBITDA this quarter was $140 million, down $2 million versus the prior year as year-over-year improvement at News U.K. and News Australia were more than offset by weaknesses at News America Marketing and higher marketing costs at Dow Jones. 
A few highlights to mention from the segment. We saw digital subscription growth across our News businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from 29 percentage points growth in WSJ digital-only subscribers and higher subscription ARPU. Digital now accounts for over 50% of Dow Jones circulation revenue. We also saw strong digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 20% from Q2 2017 and at News Australia up 26%, including a contribution from ARM.
At Dow Jones, we are also building on the renewed momentum at our professional information business, which posted 8 percentage points revenue growth, thanks to the continued strong performance from risk and compliance as Robert mentioned. We posted the highest revenue level since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
Advertising continues to be mixed across the respective division. Within the businesses, we saw advertising growth in the U.K. of 9% or 2% in local currency, the first increase in 27 quarters, driven by digital advertising growth from The Sun with a global audience that reached over 90 million monthly unique users in the second quarter as well as moderating print advertising decline. 
While at News Australia, advertising revenues improved 3 percentage points but still had an overall decline of 10% versus the prior year after excluding the impact of currency and activations and divestitures, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down mid-teens, a slight acceleration on the trends from the first quarter. 
The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million or 4 percentage points for the quarter. International expansion continues to be a strategic focus for Dow Jones. And despite the print closure, our total Wall Street Journal international subscriber base still grew 28% versus the prior year.
We continue to push very hard on our cost transformation program, notably in Australia with savings expected to be well ahead of the AUD 40 million realized last year. The program extends across every area from overheads to advertising sales consolidation to newsprint and production and photography. This quarter, as Robert mentioned, News Australia's profitability improved and increased its contribution to segment EBITDA. 
With the integration of ARM, we continue to actively look at optimizing the broader Australian portfolio with a focus on profitable growth. We had a similar story in the U.K. which also drove higher profitability this quarter.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were impacted by ongoing weakness in freestanding insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year and lower custom publishing as well as slightly lower revenues from in-store products, impacted by fewer new consumer product launches this year. Part of the decline was timing-related and we should see a sequential improvement this coming quarter.
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a solid quarter despite facing a difficult prior year comparable quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 1% to $469 million and segment EBITDA increased 7% to $80 million. 
Titles to highlight this quarter included Bad Debt by David Willis in the U.K. and Pioneer Woman Cooks Come and Get It by Ree Drummond as well as strong performances from the [indiscernible], including the by MG Thomas and a few titles from Shel Silverstein, including The Giving Tree. 
Christian Publishing revenues were lower than the prior year due to the absence of sales from the release of The Magnolia Story, which was amongst our most successful titles last year. Prior year revenues also benefited from Settle for More and Hillbilly Elegy.
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 53% of revenues in the quarter, up from 49% last year. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 2% and represented 16% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year due to the strength in downloadable audiobooks. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 21% to $292 million. Reported segment EBITDA was $119 million versus $95 million last year, up 25%.
REA Group revenues grew 24% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency. In Australia, while total residential listings were marginally lower, listings grew in the key markets of Sydney. The results were also impacted by the sale of the European businesses last year. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 18% to $110 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong lead growth -- from strong growth in lead volume as well as improving pricing optimization and inventory management. The prior year included $2 million related to title lead, which was divested in November 2016. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were over 50 million for the quarter, rising mid-teens compared to the prior year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $16 million or 15% to $120 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added approximately $8 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $33 million from $51 million, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the NRL contract, which led to approximately $22 million of higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses were $80 million this quarter compared to losses of $238 million last year, which included the write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. 
Foxtel revenues for the second quarter declined 1% to $598 million and EBITDA decreased 19% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $23 million, primarily related to The Australian football league rights, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of December 31, 2017, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. 
In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was 14.5%, down from 15.6% and broadcast ARPU was down 2%.
Regarding the pending transaction with Fox Sports, we were pleased with The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's and The Foreign Investment Review board's decisions to approve the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company. As Robert has mentioned, commercial negotiations with Telstra are ongoing, and the transaction remains on track to close, subject to board approval in the first half of calendar 2018.
On the impact of the company from the recently approved U.S. tax reform package, I would like to make a few points. The $174 million charge in this quarter primarily reflects the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as the lower statutory federal rate of 21% from 35%. 
As we are on a June 30th fiscal year-end, the impact of the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. Our effective tax rate should be modestly higher, given our significant business operations in Australia where the corporate tax rate remains at 30%.
Looking forward to the third quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, at this point, advertising trends will be broadly in line with the second quarter but visibility remains limited. At Fox Sports Australia, we expect to face higher costs in the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year, similar to the impact in the second quarter. We expect approximately AUD 30 million in higher costs for the third quarter compared to the prior year, with the full year costs expected to increase by AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million as previously mentioned.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited about Woman in the Window, which is off to a great start. This quarter, we also have the releases of Amy craft [indiscernible] and her daughter Paris Rosenthal's another bestseller in its early weeks.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth in REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business. However, as noted in its ASX announcement, REA expects to see higher cost growth in the third quarter, and listings will be impacted by the timing of Easter, which will fall in the third quarter.
We also expect to see higher investment spending at Move to support new products and to drive higher engagement. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality, high-integrity news.
Second quarter revenues grew 3% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA was up 1% to $329 million. First half revenues were up 4% and reported segment EBITDA rose 27%.
Clearly, there are profound changes taking place in the creation and the distribution of digital content. The big tech disruptors are in the midst of a particularly disruptive period commercially, socially and politically. We appreciate that Google has ended the prejudicial First Click Free and that Facebook is prioritizing provenance, but these are modest steps towards changing a digital environment that is dysfunctional and sometimes dystopian. With the support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the clear backing of the News Corp board, our company has long been the strongest international advocate of necessary changes to this [indiscernible] landscape.
It is certainly in the interest of our shareholders that there be a digital reorientation towards quality and integrity and that more people are encouraged to pay for professional journalism. There is a social and commercial value to journalism, but that value needs to be valued by the digital publishing platforms. The bot-infested badlands are hardly a safe space for advertisers, whose brands are being tarnished by association with the extreme, the violent and the repulsive.
Now let's get into the details of this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which once again reported a strong quarter with 21% revenue growth and 25% EBITDA growth, solidifying its role as a significant engine of expansion at News Corp. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, revenues rose by 18% and core real estate revenues expanded by a healthy 22%. Realtors Connections for buyers' products continues to thrive, with accelerated traffic growth as well as a continued boost in customer and lead volume in the second quarter. There's an ongoing drive to increase the profile of realtor.com as we have the highest consumer engagement and highest ROI for agents and brokers based on our latest records.
We're also making concerted push in the New York market with an emphasis on having the most extensive listings and always enlightening editorial. The realtor.com road map includes enhancements to our software and services products, which we believe provide best-in-class leads for brokers and the most comprehensive suite of essential tools. Realtor.com will also continue to focus on driving engagement with [ My Home ], which extends usage beyond search and discovery and allows owners to claim their home online and provides data that will be the basis of added value adjacencies. 
REA maintains a healthy lead over its stumbling competitor in Australia's digital real estate market with 24% revenue growth year-over-year. Since the launch of home loans, which is part of the company's broader expansion into financial services, REA had over 150,000 self-completed financial profiles by the end of January. Traffic continued to expand this quarter with REA maintaining a sizable lead over the #2 player in the market. 
We saw yet another strong quarter in Book Publishing with solid EBITDA growth at HarperCollins. There were vigorous sales from our [ children's blacklist ] and for Bad Dad by the multitalented David Walliams in the U.K. Meanwhile, the success of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks recipe book was yet another indicator of the power of America's high-plan audience. 
We're excited by the early success of A.J. Finn's debut novel, The Woman in the Window, which came out in January, and the ongoing success of the The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (Expletive). We continue to look for ways to leverage our unique titles and creativity. As announced during this past quarter, Amazon plans to license The Lord of the Rings rights for the creation of an original television series, underscoring the great value of our backlist. As J.R.R. Tolkien himself wrote, ""Still round the corner they may wait, a new road or secret gate.""
The performance of the News and Information Services segment was relatively stable, with notable improvements in profit contribution from the U.K. and Australia. At Dow Jones, circulation revenue growth remained robust with a 10% increase year-over-year. We are nearing the short-term goal of 3 million total subscribers, with 2.8 million subscribers to Dow Jones consumer products in the quarter. 
The Wall Street Journal experienced an approximate 12% increase in circulation revenues year-over-year. Meanwhile, our Professional Information business is muscular, powered by risk and compliance, which grew over 40% this quarter. Companies simply must invest in reducing risk and enhancing compliance, and Dow Jones has the necessary tools in both of these imperative areas.
At the New York Post, digital ad growth was a robust 35% and represents 60% of total ad revenues for the quarter. This quarter, we launched News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, which has authenticated audiences and the highest-quality journalism and content in the U.S. There is keen interest in leveraging our first-party data and brand-enhancing environments, which are in stark contrast to the tainted placements on so many digital platforms.
The power of News IQ also comes from concentrated collaboration across many of our business units, which will intensify as we drive our advertising business in the U.S. and pursue longer-term plans of global expansion.
At News UK, we saw a modest ad growth for the first time since 2011, driven by emerging digital ad revenue growth at The Sun where there were over 90 million global average monthly uniques in the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to see improved engagement in the U.K. audience, highlighted by higher page views and minutes per session, according to comScore data.
The increasingly popular Sun Savers program, which grew to more than 490,000 registrations as of this week, is expected to generate higher levels of engagement. It is also allowing us to gather permission data on readers, traditionally difficult for a paper with strong newsstand sales. Meanwhile, The Times and Sunday Times continue to gain market share, and digital subscribers grew 20% versus the prior year.
At Wireless Group, we saw improvement in revenues at its stations -- as its stations extended their reach and listening hours. Wireless is now home to 2 of the U.K.'s fastest growing stations, led by Virgin Radio, which grew its reach by over 60% year-over-year based on the latest independent data and talkSPORT 2, up about 40% in reach during the same period. 
It is worth noting that Unruly had its best quarter ever in terms of total revenue, led by particular buoyant growth in the U.S. As announced last week, the astute and acute Norm Johnson is assuming the CEO role at Unruly, and co-Founder Sarah Wood will become chair of the Unruly board and continue to exercise a positive influence.
News Corp Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher with an audience of approximately 16 million per month. We saw an acceleration in digital advertising revenue growth, reflecting several changes in the sales structure that better aligned our teams with the evolving need of advertising. And we remain focused on cost management initiatives to improve operating efficiency, resulting in higher contribution to profitability. 
Susan, who has just returned from Australia, will shortly elaborate on these positive developments. The Australian continued to grow digital subscribers, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time. Significantly more than 50% of its paid weekday volume is now digital.
On the proposed combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports, we received both ACCC and FIRB approvals and are in the process of finalizing what is a complex arrangement with Telstra. That focus has given us an opportunity to begin the reshaping of the 2 companies, and the first step was the appointment of a new Foxtel CEO, the excellent Patrick Delaney. We would like to thank his predecessor, Peter Tonagh, for his sterling contribution during a transitional period and to News Corp over many years.
Once again, this strong quarter showcased the benefits of News Corp's digital strategy, the value of being disciplined on cost and the efficacy of ever-increasing cooperation among our companies.
Before I turn the platform over to Susan to expand on our results, one final word about taxes. Passage of tax reform in the United States should be beneficial to our company and our people, our investors and our customers. At the founding of the new news, we had strong confidence in the potential for U.S. growth. We have invested significantly in U.S. digital real estate and U.S. Book Publishing, for example, and expect to reap even greater rewards, thanks to the tax reform program, which will make the country a better place to do business and creates more opportunities for all Americans. And now over to Susan."
212741644,549818954,1384879,"News Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-08,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Rea",1854,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $329 million, up from $325 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, earnings per share were a loss of $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.50 in the prior year. This quarter's results include a charge related to the remission of the deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. I'll discuss in a few moments the expected impact from the U.S. tax reform going forward.
You may recall the prior year period included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million related to The Australian publishing division fixed assets and a $227 million pretax noncash write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes both items and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, were $0.24 compared to $0.19 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. The acquisition of Australian Regional Media or ARM and foreign exchange contributed $30 million and $33 million, respectively, this quarter.
Within segment revenues, advertising was down 6% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 6%. Within our core news businesses, Dow Jones revenues rose 1%, News UK grew by 7% and News Australia grew by 4%. These increases were offset by a 16% decline at News America Marketing as we flagged during the last earnings call. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
Segment EBITDA this quarter was $140 million, down $2 million versus the prior year as year-over-year improvement at News UK and News Australia were more than offset by weaknesses at News America Marketing and higher marketing costs at Dow Jones. 
A few highlights to mention from the segment. We saw digital subscription growth across our News businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from 29 percentage points growth in WSJ digital-only subscribers and higher subscription ARPU. Digital now accounts for over 50% of Dow Jones circulation revenue. We also saw strong digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 20% from Q2 2017 and at News Australia up 26%, including a contribution from ARM.
At Dow Jones, we are also building on the renewed momentum at our Professional Information business, which posted 8 percentage points revenue growth, thanks to the continued strong performance from risk and compliance as Robert mentioned. We posted the highest revenue level since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
Advertising continues to be mixed across the respective division. Within the businesses, we saw advertising growth in the U.K. of 9% or 2% in local currency, the first increase in 27 quarters, driven by digital advertising growth from The Sun with a global audience that reached over 90 million monthly unique users in the second quarter as well as moderating print advertising decline. 
While at News Australia, advertising revenues improved 3 percentage points but still had an overall decline of 10% versus the prior year after excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down mid-teens, a slight acceleration on the trends from the first quarter. 
The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million or 4 percentage points for the quarter. International expansion continues to be a strategic focus for Dow Jones. And despite the print closure, our total Wall Street Journal international subscriber base still grew 28% versus the prior year.
We continue to push very hard on our cost transformation program, notably in Australia with savings expected to be well ahead of the AUD 40 million realized last year. The program extends across every area from overheads to advertising sales consolidation to newsprint and production and photography. This quarter, as Robert mentioned, News Australia's profitability improved and increased its contribution to segment EBITDA. 
With the integration of ARM, we continue to actively look at optimizing the broader Australian portfolio with a focus on profitable growth. We had a similar story in the U.K. which also drove higher profitability this quarter.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were impacted by ongoing weakness in free standing insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year and lower custom publishing as well as slightly lower revenues from in-store products, impacted by fewer new consumer product launches this year. Part of the decline was timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement this coming quarter.
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a solid quarter despite facing a difficult prior year comparable quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 1% to $469 million and segment EBITDA increased 7% to $80 million. 
Titles to highlight this quarter included Bad Dad by David Walliams in the U.K. and Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! by Ree Drummond as well as strong performances from the [ children's backlist ], including the [indiscernible] by [ Andrew Thomas ] and a few titles from Shel Silverstein, including The Giving Tree. 
Christian Publishing revenues were lower than the prior year due to the absence of sales from the release of The Magnolia Story, which was amongst our most successful titles last year. Prior year revenues also benefited from Settle for More and Hillbilly Elegy.
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 53% of revenues in the quarter, up from 49% last year. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 2% and represented 16% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year due to the strength in downloadable audiobooks. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 21% to $292 million. Reported segment EBITDA was $119 million versus $95 million last year, up 25%.
REA Group revenues grew 24% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for [indiscernible], the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency. In Australia, while total residential listings were marginally lower, listings grew in the key markets of Melbourne and Sydney. The results were also impacted by the sale of the European businesses last year. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 18% to $110 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong lead growth -- from strong growth in lead volume as well as improving pricing optimization and inventory management. The prior year included $2 million related to title lead, which was divested in November 2016. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were over 50 million for the quarter, rising mid-teens compared to the prior year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $16 million or 15% to $120 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added approximately $8 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $33 million from $51 million, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the NRL contract, which led to approximately $22 million of higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses were $80 million this quarter compared to losses of $238 million last year, which included the write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. 
Foxtel revenues for the second quarter declined 1% to $598 million and EBITDA decreased 19% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $23 million, primarily related to The Australian football league rights, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of December 31, 2017, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. 
In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was 14.5%, down from 15.6% and broadcast ARPU was down 2%.
Regarding the pending transaction with Fox Sports, we were pleased with The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's and The Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions to approve the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company. As Robert has mentioned, commercial negotiations with Telstra are ongoing, and the transaction remains on track to close, subject to board approval in the first half of calendar 2018.
On the impact for the company from the recently approved U.S. tax reform package, I would like to make a few points. The $174 million charge in this quarter primarily reflects the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower statutory federal rate of 21% from 35%. 
As we are on a June 30th fiscal year-end, the impact of the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. Our effective tax rate should be modestly higher, given our significant business operations in Australia where the corporate tax rate remains at 30%.
Looking forward to the third quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, at this point, advertising trends will be broadly in line with the second quarter, but visibility remains limited. At Fox Sports Australia, we expect to face higher costs in the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year, similar to the impact in the second quarter. We expect approximately AUD 30 million in higher costs for the third quarter compared to the prior year, with the full year costs expected to increase by AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million as previously mentioned.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited about A.J. Finn's The Woman in The Window, which is off to a great start. This quarter, we also have the release of Amy Krouse Rosenthal and her daughter, Paris Rosenthal, Dear Girl, another bestseller in its early weeks.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business. However, as noted in its ASX announcement, REA expects to see higher cost growth in the third quarter, and listings will be impacted by the timing of Easter, which will fall in the third quarter.
We also expect to see higher investment spending at Move to support new products and to drive higher engagement. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality, high-integrity news.
Second quarter revenues grew 3% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA was up 1% to $329 million. First half revenues were up 4% and reported segment EBITDA rose 27%.
Clearly, there are profound changes taking place in the creation and the distribution of digital content. The big tech disruptors are in the midst of a particularly disruptive period commercially, socially and politically. We appreciate that Google has ended the prejudicial First Click Free and that Facebook is prioritizing provenance, but these are modest steps towards changing a digital environment that is dysfunctional and sometimes dystopian. With the support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the clear backing of the News Corp board, our company has long been the strongest international advocate of necessary changes to this mephitic landscape.
It is certainly in the interests of our shareholders that there be a digital reorientation towards quality and integrity and that more people are encouraged to pay for professional journalism. There is a social and commercial value to journalism, but that value needs to be valued by the digital publishing platforms. The bot-infested badlands are hardly a safe space for advertisers, whose brands are being tarnished by association with the extreme, the violent and the repulsive.
Now let's get into the details of this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which once again reported a strong quarter with 21% revenue growth and 25% EBITDA growth, solidifying its role as a significant engine of expansion at News Corp. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, revenues rose by 18% and core real estate revenues expanded by a healthy 22%. Realtors Connections for buyers' products continues to thrive, with accelerated traffic growth as well as a continued boost in customer and lead volume in the second quarter. There is an ongoing drive to increase the profile of realtor.com as we have the highest consumer engagement and highest ROI for agents and brokers based on our latest [ records ].
We're also making a concerted push in the New York market with an emphasis on having the most extensive listings and always enlightening editorial. The realtor.com road map includes enhancements to our software and services products, which we believe provide best-in-class leads for brokers and the most comprehensive suite of essential tools. Realtor.com will also continue to focus on driving engagement with My Home, which extends usage beyond search and discovery and allows owners to claim their home online and provides data that will be the basis of added value adjacencies. 
REA maintains a healthy lead over its stumbling competitor in Australia's digital real estate market with 24% revenue growth year-over-year. Since the launch of home loans, which is part of the company's broader expansion into financial services, REA had over 150,000 self-completed financial profiles by the end of January. Traffic continued to expand this quarter with REA maintaining a sizable lead over the #2 player in the market. 
We saw yet another strong quarter in Book Publishing with solid EBITDA growth at HarperCollins. There were vigorous sales from our children's backlist and for Bad Dad by the multitalented David Walliams in the U.K. Meanwhile, the success of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks recipe book was yet another indicator of the power of America's [ higher-planned ] audience. 
We're excited by the early success of A.J. Finn's debut novel, The Woman in the Window, which came out in January, and the ongoing success of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (expletive). We continue to look for ways to leverage our unique titles and creativity. As announced during this past quarter, Amazon plans to license The Lord of the Rings rights for the creation of an original television series, underscoring the great value of our backlist. As J.R.R. Tolkien himself wrote, ""Still round the corner there may wait a new road or secret gate.""
The performance of the News and Information Services segment was relatively stable, with notable improvements in profit contribution from the U.K. and Australia. At Dow Jones, circulation revenue growth remained robust with a 10% increase year-over-year. We are nearing the short-term goal of 3 million total subscribers, with 2.8 million subscribers to Dow Jones consumer products in the quarter. 
The Wall Street Journal experienced an approximate 12% increase in circulation revenues year-over-year. Meanwhile, our Professional Information business is muscular, powered by risk and compliance, which grew over 40% this quarter. Companies simply must invest in reducing risk and enhancing compliance, and Dow Jones has the necessary tools in both of these imperative areas.
At the New York Post, digital ad growth was a robust 35% and represented 60% of total ad revenues for the quarter. This quarter, we launched News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, which has authenticated audiences and the highest-quality journalism and content in the U.S. There is keen interest in leveraging our first-party data and brand-enhancing environments, which are in stark contrast to the tainted placements on so many digital platforms.
The power of News IQ also comes from concentrated collaboration across many of our business units, which will intensify as we drive our advertising business in the U.S. and pursue longer-term plans of global expansion.
At News UK, we saw modest ad growth for the first time since 2011, driven by emerging digital ad revenue growth at The Sun where there were over 90 million global average monthly uniques in the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to see improved engagement in the U.K. audience, highlighted by higher page views and minutes per session, according to comScore data.
The increasingly popular Sun Savers program, which grew to more than 490,000 registrations as of this week, is expected to generate higher levels of engagement. It is also allowing us to gather permissioned data on readers, traditionally difficult for a paper with strong newsstand sales. Meanwhile, The Times and Sunday Times continue to gain market share, and digital subscribers grew 20% versus the prior year.
At Wireless Group, we saw improvement in revenues at its stations -- as its stations extended their reach and listening hours. Wireless is now home to 2 of the U.K.'s fastest growing stations, led by Virgin Radio, which grew its reach by over 60% year-over-year based on the latest independent data and talkSPORT 2, up about 40% in reach during the same period. 
It is worth noting that Unruly had its best quarter ever in terms of total revenue, led by particularly buoyant growth in the U.S. As announced last week, the astute and acute Norm Johnson is assuming the CEO role at Unruly, and co-Founder Sarah Wood will become chair of the Unruly board and continue to exercise a positive influence.
News Corp Australia remained the largest print and digital publisher with an audience of approximately 16 million per month. We saw an acceleration in digital advertising revenue growth, reflecting several changes in the sales structure that better aligned our teams with the evolving need of advertisers. And we remain focused on cost management initiatives to improve operating efficiency, resulting in higher contribution to profitability. 
Susan, who has just returned from Australia, will shortly elaborate on these positive developments. The Australian continued to grow digital subscribers, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time. Significantly more than 50% of its paid weekday volume is now digital.
On the proposed combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports, we received both ACCC and FIRB approvals and are in the process of finalizing what is a complex arrangement with Telstra. That focus has given us an opportunity to begin the reshaping of the 2 companies, and the first step was the appointment of a new Foxtel CEO, the excellent Patrick Delaney. We would like to thank his predecessor, Peter Tonagh, for his sterling contribution during a transitional period and to News Corp over many years.
Once again, this strong quarter showcased the benefits of News Corp's digital strategy, the value of being disciplined on cost and the efficacy of ever-increasing cooperation among our companies.
Before I turn the platform over to Susan to expand on our results, one final word about taxes. Passage of tax reform in the United States should be beneficial to our company and our people, our investors and our customers. At the founding of the new News, we had strong confidence in the potential for U.S. growth. We have invested significantly in U.S. digital real estate and U.S. Book Publishing, for example, and expect to reap even greater rewards, thanks to the tax reform program, which will make the country a better place to do business and creates more opportunities for all Americans. And now over to Susan."
212741644,549818954,1385476,"News Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-08,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Rea",1850,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $329 million, up from $325 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, earnings per share were a loss of $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.50 in the prior year. This quarter's results include a charge related to the remission of deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. I'll discuss in a few moments the expected impact from the U.S. tax reform going forward.
You may recall the prior year period included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million related to The Australian publishing division fixed assets and a $227 million pretax noncash write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes both items and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, were $0.24 compared to $0.19 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. The acquisition of Australian Regional Media or ARM and foreign exchange contributed $30 million and $33 million, respectively, this quarter.
Within segment revenues, advertising was down 6% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 6%. Within our core news businesses, Dow Jones revenues rose 1%, News UK grew by 7% and News Australia grew by 4%. These increases were offset by a 16% decline at News America Marketing as we flagged during the last earnings call. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
Segment EBITDA this quarter was $140 million, down $2 million versus the prior year as year-over-year improvements at News UK and News Australia were more than offset by weaknesses at News America Marketing and higher marketing costs at Dow Jones. 
A few highlights to mention from the segment. We saw digital subscription growth across our News businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from 29 percentage points growth in WSJ digital-only subscribers and higher subscription ARPU. Digital now accounts for over 50% of Dow Jones circulation revenue. We also saw strong digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 20% from Q2 2017 and at News Australia up 26%, including a contribution from ARM.
At Dow Jones, we are also building on the renewed momentum at our Professional Information business, which posted 8 percentage points revenue growth, thanks to the continued strong performance from risk and compliance as Robert mentioned. We posted the highest revenue levels since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
Advertising continues to be mixed across the respective divisions. Within the businesses, we saw advertising growth in the U.K. of 9% or 2% in local currency, the first increase in 27 quarters, driven by digital advertising growth from The Sun with a global audience that reached over 90 million monthly unique users in the second quarter as well as moderating print advertising decline. 
While at News Australia, advertising revenues improved 3 percentage points but still had an overall decline of 10% versus the prior year after excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down mid-teens, a slight acceleration on the trend from the first quarter. 
The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million or 4 percentage points for the quarter. International expansion continues to be a strategic focus for Dow Jones. And despite the print closure, our total Wall Street Journal international subscriber base still grew 28% versus the prior year.
We continue to push very hard on our cost transformation program, notably in Australia with savings expected to be well ahead of the AUD 40 million realized last year. The program extends across every area from overheads to advertising sales consolidation to newsprint and production and photography. This quarter, as Robert mentioned, News Australia's profitability improved and increased its contribution to segment EBITDA. 
With the integration of ARM, we continue to actively look at optimizing the broader Australian portfolio with a focus on profitable growth. We had a similar story in the U.K. which also drove higher profitability this quarter.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were impacted by ongoing weakness in free standing insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year and lower custom publishing as well as slightly lower revenues from in-store products, impacted by fewer new consumer product launches this year. Part of the decline was timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement this coming quarter.
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a solid quarter despite facing a difficult prior year comparable quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 1% to $469 million and segment EBITDA increased 7% to $80 million. 
Titles to highlight this quarter included Bad Dad by David Walliams in the U.K. and Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! by Ree Drummond as well as strong performances from the children's backlist, including The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and a few titles from Shel Silverstein, including The Giving Tree. 
Christian Publishing revenues were lower than the prior year due to the absence of sales from the release of The Magnolia Story, which was amongst our most successful titles last year. Prior year revenues also benefited from Settle for More and Hillbilly Elegy.
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 53% of revenues in the quarter, up from 49% last year. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 2% and represented 16% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year due to the strength in downloadable audiobooks. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 21% to $292 million. Reported segment EBITDA was $119 million versus $95 million last year, up 25%.
REA Group revenues grew 24% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency. In Australia, while total residential listings were marginally lower, listings grew in the key markets of Melbourne and Sydney. The results were also impacted by the sale of the European business last year. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 18% to $110 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong lead growth -- from strong growth in lead volume as well as improving pricing optimization and inventory management. The prior year included $2 million related to TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were over 50 million for the quarter, rising mid-teens compared to the prior year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $16 million or 15% to $120 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added approximately $8 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $33 million from $51 million, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the NRL contract, which led to approximately $22 million of higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses were $18 million this quarter compared to losses of $238 million last year, which included the write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. 
Foxtel revenues for the second quarter declined 1% to $598 million and EBITDA decreased 19% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $23 million, primarily related to The Australian football league rights, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of December 31, 2017, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. 
In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was 14.5%, down from 15.6% and broadcast ARPU was down 2%.
Regarding the pending transaction with Fox Sports, we were pleased with The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's and The Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions to approve the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company. As Robert has mentioned, commercial negotiations with Telstra are ongoing, and the transaction remains on track to close, subject to board approval in the first half of calendar 2018.
On the impact for the company from the recently approved U.S. tax reform package, I would like to make a few points. The $174 million charge in this quarter primarily reflects the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower statutory federal rate of 21% from 35%. 
As we are on a June 30th fiscal year-end, the impact of the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. Our effective tax rate should be modestly higher, given our significant business operations in Australia where the corporate tax rate remains at 30%.
Looking forward to the third quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, at this point, advertising trends appear broadly in line with the second quarter, but visibility remains limited. At Fox Sports Australia, we expect to face higher costs in the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year, similar to the impact in the second quarter. We expect approximately AUD 30 million in higher costs for the third quarter compared to the prior year, with the full year costs expected to increase by AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million as previously mentioned.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited about A.J. Finn's The Woman in The Window, which is off to a great start. This quarter, we also have the release of Amy Krouse Rosenthal and her daughter, Paris Rosenthal's Dear Girl, another bestseller in its early weeks.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business. However, as noted in its ASX announcement, REA expects to see higher cost growth in the third quarter, and listings will be impacted by the timing of Easter, which will fall in the third quarter.
We also expect to see higher investment spending at Move to support new products and to drive higher engagement. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Print, which remains a strong platform, and we're seeing that with a new real estate magazine that we're launching in coming months, which is oversubscribed by advertisers. So don't discount print. But the digital market itself really is in the midst of our people where you have both advertisers and ad agencies reviewing their role in the market. A great deal of concern about the sort of environments in which famous prestigious advertisers find themselves. And I think what we are gradually going to see, and I think we have little doubt about this, is that there will be a migration to premium, and that's where we have a comparative advantage because titles around the world are the leading titles in their markets. And to supplement that, we are creating News IQ, which is our own in-house-based advertising platform, taking advantage of the great inventory we have and the authenticated audiences we have and being able to offer advertisers an opportunity to project their image and their wares in a space that won't be detrimental to their image but brand enhancing."

The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality",1481,"Thank you, Mike. The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management and our commitment to premium content and to high-quality, high-integrity news.
Second quarter revenues grew 3% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA was up 1% to $329 million. First half revenues were up 4% and reported segment EBITDA rose 27%.
Clearly, there are profound changes taking place in the creation and the distribution of digital content. The big tech disruptors are in the midst of a particularly disruptive period commercially, socially and politically. We appreciate that Google has ended the prejudicial First Click Free and that Facebook is prioritizing provenance, but these are modest steps towards changing a digital environment that is dysfunctional and sometimes dystopian. With the support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the clear backing of the News Corp board, our company has long been the strongest international advocate of necessary changes to this mephitic landscape.
It is certainly in the interests of our shareholders that there be a digital reorientation towards quality and integrity and that more people are encouraged to pay for professional journalism. There is a social and commercial value to journalism, but that value needs to be valued by the digital publishing platforms. The bot-infested badlands are hardly a safe space for advertisers, whose brands are being tarnished by association with the extreme, the violent and the repulsive.
Now let's get into the details of this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which once again reported a strong quarter with 21% revenue growth and 25% EBITDA growth, solidifying its role as a significant engine of expansion at News Corp. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, revenues rose by 18% and core real estate revenues expanded by a healthy 22%. Realtors Connections for buyers' products continues to thrive, with accelerated traffic growth as well as a continued boost in customer and lead volume in the second quarter. There is an ongoing drive to increase the profile of realtor.com as we have the highest consumer engagement and highest ROI for agents and brokers based on our latest [ records ].
We're also making a concerted push in the New York market with an emphasis on having the most extensive listings and always enlightening editorial. The realtor.com road map includes enhancements to our software and services products, which we believe provide best-in-class leads for brokers and the most comprehensive suite of essential tools. Realtor.com will also continue to focus on driving engagement with My Home, which extends usage beyond search and discovery and allows owners to claim their home online and provides data that will be the basis of added value adjacencies. 
REA maintains a healthy lead over its stumbling competitor in Australia's digital real estate market with 24% revenue growth year-over-year. Since the launch of home loans, which is part of the company's broader expansion into financial services, REA had over 150,000 self-completed financial profiles by the end of January. Traffic continued to expand this quarter with REA maintaining a sizable lead over the #2 player in the market. 
We saw yet another strong quarter in Book Publishing with solid EBITDA growth at HarperCollins. There were vigorous sales from our children's backlist and for Bad Dad by the multitalented David Walliams in the U.K. Meanwhile, the success of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks recipe book was yet another indicator of the power of America's [ higher-planned ] audience. 
We're excited by the early success of A.J. Finn's debut novel, The Woman in the Window, which came out in January, and the ongoing success of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (expletive). We continue to look for ways to leverage our unique titles and creativity. As announced during this past quarter, Amazon plans to license The Lord of the Rings rights for the creation of an original television series, underscoring the great value of our backlist. As J.R.R. Tolkien himself wrote, ""Still round the corner there may wait a new road or secret gate.""
The performance of the News and Information Services segment was relatively stable, with notable improvements in profit contribution from the U.K. and Australia. At Dow Jones, circulation revenue growth remained robust with a 10% increase year-over-year. We are nearing the short-term goal of 3 million total subscribers, with 2.8 million subscribers to Dow Jones consumer products in the quarter. 
The Wall Street Journal experienced an approximate 12% increase in circulation revenues year-over-year. Meanwhile, our Professional Information business is muscular, powered by risk and compliance, which grew over 40% this quarter. Companies simply must invest in reducing risk and enhancing compliance, and Dow Jones has the necessary tools in both of these imperative areas.
At the New York Post, digital ad growth was a robust 35% and represented 60% of total ad revenues for the quarter. This quarter, we launched News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, which has authenticated audiences and the highest-quality journalism and content in the U.S. There is keen interest in leveraging our first-party data and brand-enhancing environments, which are in stark contrast to the tainted placements on so many digital platforms.
The power of News IQ also comes from concentrated collaboration across many of our business units, which will intensify as we drive our advertising business in the U.S. and pursue longer-term plans of global expansion.
At News UK, we saw modest ad growth for the first time since 2011, driven by emerging digital ad revenue growth at The Sun where there were over 90 million global average monthly uniques in the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to see improved engagement in the U.K. audience, highlighted by higher page views and minutes per session, according to comScore data.
The increasingly popular Sun Savers program, which grew to more than 490,000 registrations as of this week, is expected to generate higher levels of engagement. It is also allowing us to gather permissioned data on readers, traditionally difficult for a paper with strong newsstand sales. Meanwhile, The Times and Sunday Times continue to gain market share, and digital subscribers grew 20% versus the prior year.
At Wireless Group, we saw improvement in revenues at its stations -- as its stations extended their reach and listening hours. Wireless is now home to 2 of the U.K.'s fastest growing stations, led by Virgin Radio, which grew its reach by over 60% year-over-year based on the latest independent data and talkSPORT 2, up about 40% in reach during the same period. 
It is worth noting that Unruly had its best quarter ever in terms of total revenue, led by particularly buoyant growth in the U.S. As announced last week, the astute and acute Norm Johnson is assuming the CEO role at Unruly, and co-Founder Sarah Wood will become chair of the Unruly board and continue to exercise a positive influence.
News Corp Australia remained the largest print and digital publisher with an audience of approximately 16 million per month. We saw an acceleration in digital advertising revenue growth, reflecting several changes in the sales structure that better aligned our teams with the evolving need of advertisers. And we remain focused on cost management initiatives to improve operating efficiency, resulting in higher contribution to profitability. 
Susan, who has just returned from Australia, will shortly elaborate on these positive developments. The Australian continued to grow digital subscribers, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time. Significantly more than 50% of its paid weekday volume is now digital.
On the proposed combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports, we received both ACCC and FIRB approvals and are in the process of finalizing what is a complex arrangement with Telstra. That focus has given us an opportunity to begin the reshaping of the 2 companies, and the first step was the appointment of a new Foxtel CEO, the excellent Patrick Delaney. We would like to thank his predecessor, Peter Tonagh, for his sterling contribution during a transitional period and to News Corp over many years.
Once again, this strong quarter showcased the benefits of News Corp's digital strategy, the value of being disciplined on cost and the efficacy of ever-increasing cooperation among our companies.
Before I turn the platform over to Susan to expand on our results, one final word about taxes. Passage of tax reform in the United States should be beneficial to our company and our people, our investors and our customers. At the founding of the new News, we had strong confidence in the potential for U.S. growth. We have invested significantly in U.S. digital real estate and U.S. Book Publishing, for example, and expect to reap even greater rewards, thanks to the tax reform program, which will make the country a better place to do business and creates more opportunities for all Americans. And now over to Susan."
212741644,549818954,1388093,"News Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2018",2018-02-08,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Rea",1850,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $329 million, up from $325 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, earnings per share were a loss of $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.50 in the prior year. This quarter's results include a charge related to the remission of deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. I'll discuss in a few moments the expected impact from the U.S. tax reform going forward.
You may recall the prior year period included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million related to The Australian publishing division fixed assets and a $227 million pretax noncash write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes both items and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, were $0.24 compared to $0.19 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. The acquisition of Australian Regional Media or ARM and foreign exchange contributed $30 million and $33 million, respectively, this quarter.
Within segment revenues, advertising was down 6% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 6%. Within our core news businesses, Dow Jones revenues rose 1%, News UK grew by 7% and News Australia grew by 4%. These increases were offset by a 16% decline at News America Marketing as we flagged during the last earnings call. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
Segment EBITDA this quarter was $140 million, down $2 million versus the prior year as year-over-year improvements at News UK and News Australia were more than offset by weaknesses at News America Marketing and higher marketing costs at Dow Jones. 
A few highlights to mention from the segment. We saw digital subscription growth across our News businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from 29 percentage points growth in WSJ digital-only subscribers and higher subscription ARPU. Digital now accounts for over 50% of Dow Jones circulation revenue. We also saw strong digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 20% from Q2 2017 and at News Australia up 26%, including a contribution from ARM.
At Dow Jones, we are also building on the renewed momentum at our Professional Information business, which posted 8 percentage points revenue growth, thanks to the continued strong performance from risk and compliance as Robert mentioned. We posted the highest revenue levels since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
Advertising continues to be mixed across the respective divisions. Within the businesses, we saw advertising growth in the U.K. of 9% or 2% in local currency, the first increase in 27 quarters, driven by digital advertising growth from The Sun with a global audience that reached over 90 million monthly unique users in the second quarter as well as moderating print advertising decline. 
While at News Australia, advertising revenues improved 3 percentage points but still had an overall decline of 10% versus the prior year after excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down mid-teens, a slight acceleration on the trend from the first quarter. 
The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million or 4 percentage points for the quarter. International expansion continues to be a strategic focus for Dow Jones. And despite the print closure, our total Wall Street Journal international subscriber base still grew 28% versus the prior year.
We continue to push very hard on our cost transformation program, notably in Australia with savings expected to be well ahead of the AUD 40 million realized last year. The program extends across every area from overheads to advertising sales consolidation to newsprint and production and photography. This quarter, as Robert mentioned, News Australia's profitability improved and increased its contribution to segment EBITDA. 
With the integration of ARM, we continue to actively look at optimizing the broader Australian portfolio with a focus on profitable growth. We had a similar story in the U.K. which also drove higher profitability this quarter.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were impacted by ongoing weakness in free standing insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year and lower custom publishing as well as slightly lower revenues from in-store products, impacted by fewer new consumer product launches this year. Part of the decline was timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement this coming quarter.
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a solid quarter despite facing a difficult prior year comparable quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 1% to $469 million and segment EBITDA increased 7% to $80 million. 
Titles to highlight this quarter included Bad Dad by David Walliams in the U.K. and Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! by Ree Drummond as well as strong performances from the children's backlist, including The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and a few titles from Shel Silverstein, including The Giving Tree. 
Christian Publishing revenues were lower than the prior year due to the absence of sales from the release of The Magnolia Story, which was amongst our most successful titles last year. Prior year revenues also benefited from Settle for More and Hillbilly Elegy.
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 53% of revenues in the quarter, up from 49% last year. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 2% and represented 16% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year due to the strength in downloadable audiobooks. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 21% to $292 million. Reported segment EBITDA was $119 million versus $95 million last year, up 25%.
REA Group revenues grew 24% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency. In Australia, while total residential listings were marginally lower, listings grew in the key markets of Melbourne and Sydney. The results were also impacted by the sale of the European business last year. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 18% to $110 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong lead growth -- from strong growth in lead volume as well as improving pricing optimization and inventory management. The prior year included $2 million related to TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were over 50 million for the quarter, rising mid-teens compared to the prior year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $16 million or 15% to $120 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added approximately $8 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $33 million from $51 million, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the NRL contract, which led to approximately $22 million of higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses were $18 million this quarter compared to losses of $238 million last year, which included the write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. 
Foxtel revenues for the second quarter declined 1% to $598 million and EBITDA decreased 19% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $23 million, primarily related to The Australian football league rights, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of December 31, 2017, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. 
In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was 14.5%, down from 15.6% and broadcast ARPU was down 2%.
Regarding the pending transaction with Fox Sports, we were pleased with The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's and The Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions to approve the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company. As Robert has mentioned, commercial negotiations with Telstra are ongoing, and the transaction remains on track to close, subject to board approval in the first half of calendar 2018.
On the impact for the company from the recently approved U.S. tax reform package, I would like to make a few points. The $174 million charge in this quarter primarily reflects the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower statutory federal rate of 21% from 35%. 
As we are on a June 30th fiscal year-end, the impact of the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. Our effective tax rate should be modestly higher, given our significant business operations in Australia where the corporate tax rate remains at 30%.
Looking forward to the third quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, at this point, advertising trends appear broadly in line with the second quarter, but visibility remains limited. At Fox Sports Australia, we expect to face higher costs in the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year, similar to the impact in the second quarter. We expect approximately AUD 30 million in higher costs for the third quarter compared to the prior year, with the full year costs expected to increase by AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million as previously mentioned.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited about A.J. Finn's The Woman in The Window, which is off to a great start. This quarter, we also have the release of Amy Krouse Rosenthal and her daughter, Paris Rosenthal's Dear Girl, another bestseller in its early weeks.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business. However, as noted in its ASX announcement, REA expects to see higher cost growth in the third quarter, and listings will be impacted by the timing of Easter, which will fall in the third quarter.
We also expect to see higher investment spending at Move to support new products and to drive higher engagement. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

A great deal of concern about the sort of environments in which famous prestigious advertisers find themselves. And I think what we are gradually going to see, and I think we have little doubt about this, is that there will be a migration to premium, and that's where we have a comparative advantage because titles around the world are the leading titles in their markets. And to supplement that, we are creating News IQ, which is our own in-house-based advertising platform, taking advantage of the great inventory we have and the authenticated audiences we have and being able to offer advertisers an opportunity to project their image and their wares in a space that won't be detrimental to their image but brand enhancing."

In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new news in 2013. The com",1887,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new news in 2013. 
The company continues to deliver on its strategic mission to become increasingly global and digital, with an ever greater focus on collaboration and innovation and that focus is evident from this quarter's results. We are particularly pleased with the progress in digital real estate where revenues grew 27%, and we fortified the business for future growth. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $192 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.
It's worth highlighting that for the first 9 months, reported revenues were $6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, a noncash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America Marketing.
Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the Digital Real Estate Services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel-Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of our volatile advertising market.
The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months, as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corp, under the leadership of Robert Lachlan Murdoch, has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.
The end of Google's prejudicial First Click Free policy, which punished high-quality journalism, has already benefited our mastheads, and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is, however, just the first step on the pathway to prominence. 
We and other publishers are also discussion -- in discussion with Facebook, which certainly professes concern about virtue and veracity. While authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance an experience being polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. 
The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board, which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. These algorithms are already potent but they are destined to be much more formidable, and their abundance, potential to skew news and skew our customers needs to be better understood and monitored. 
And an Algorithm Review Board, or ARB, would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our mastheads, our journalism and our advertising clients who are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.
Now let's examine in more detail this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which continue to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter and Tracy and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the site. 
REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by its emerging financial services business. REA gained traction with its own mortgage operations, and as of the end of March, had more than 0.25 million self-completed financial profiles. Given the concern about the financial services industry in Australia, the team perceives an opening for a business that truly focus on customers needs and aspirations.
Meanwhile, REA saw strong traffic growth in Southeast Asia with signs of improving revenue trends from the previous quarter in a market that is still in the early days of its digital evolution.
Last week, REA announced the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, a provider of innovative property data to the financial services sector. This will allow REA to deliver an increasing flow of insightful intelligence to customers and consumers and should further strengthen its position at the heart of the Australian property market.
At Move, there was 15% revenue growth overall with a healthy 19% coming from its core real estate business. There was a robust performance in the lead base connection bias product as well as strong audience growth and more intense engagement.
In the next few months, realty.com will be launching Real Suite, a mobile-based system, which will enable advertisers to provide the best possible service to their clients, increasing responsiveness, highlighting meaningful leads and providing consumers with the level of service they expect throughout the transaction process. 
Meanwhile, we note with much interest that Zillow is expanding its Instant Office program. Understandably, agents and brokers are eyeing this move with legitimate concern as we believe Zillow's focus on slipping is indicative of its long-term intent. Our very close relationship with agents and brokers is even more valuable today as we work with the industry to drive high-quality lead volume and provide sophisticated market intelligence to sellers and buyers.
At News and Information Services, while print advertising remains challenging, we saw an overall improvement in advertising trends in the third quarter. News UK reported the second consecutive quarter of ad revenue growth for the first time in 7 years. And under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, all our U.K. mastheads gained market share in circulation. 
Also in the U.K., Wireless Group experienced strong listenership and improved revenues compared to the prior year, with standout performances at Virgin Radio and Talk Radio. Wireless's audience growth has outpaced the U.K. radio market, in general, based on the latest data. Fox Sports is also, looking forward, expectantly to its coverage of the World Cup this June. Clearly, audience interest will, in part, depend on England's on-field exploits. Let us hope that past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Unruly had another strong quarter, driven by growth in the U.S., U.K. and Japan as programmatic continues to . Unruly's consistent innovation in the ad distribution market and its provision of authenticated audiences make it particularly valuable at a time when advertisers are questioning value and veracity.
At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal's digital earning subscriber growth was 24% year-over-year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones again increased 10% as our publications served a growing public demand for timely and reliable news. Total subscribers across Dow Jones recently passed their 3 million target based on preliminary internal metrics, and we expect continued growth in coming quarters.
Revenues at the professional information business expanded 9%, led by the sterling performance of Risk and Compliance, with 45% year-over-year growth in its revenues. Reducing risk and ensuring compliance are clearly imperatives for our corporate clients.
While advertising declined overall, it did so at a slower rate compared to Q2 and driven by low teens digital ad growth. The New York Post had strong advertising and audience numbers with 87 million uniques in March, a 72% year-over-year spike. In Australia, we made progress in reviewing our regional papers and continue to focus on core metro titles and The Australian, streamlining the business and improving operating efficiencies. Digital paid subscribers in News Australian grew 23% and we also saw robust digital ad revenue growth.
One final note for the News and Information Services segment. Taken together, our premium publications, The Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian experienced an average growth in digital subscriptions for Q3 of more than 20%, a testament to the success of the digital transformation of these mastheads.
In Book Publishing, we experienced a strong quarter with robust revenue and profitability at HarperCollins. This success was driven in part by best-selling U.S. titles such as A.J. Finn's The Woman In The Window, the only debut work of fiction in the past 12 years to immediately reach #1, and the continuing strength of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. 
Notably, our Christian publishing performed well with one of the year's best-performing titles, Kathie Lee Gifford's The Rock, the Road and The Rabbi and renewed interest in the works of Billy. [indiscernible] continues to look for ways to leverage our global platform, including an important pact with best-selling author, Daniel Silver, acquiring the world rights to 6 more of his books starting with The Other Woman in July 2018.
We have finalized a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, underscoring the power of our back list. We expect to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as a result of this deal.
We're excited about the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, giving News Corp 65% of the business and our partners at Telstra of 35%. This agreement creates fresh opportunities of collaboration and comes at a time when over-the-top is becoming a significant part of our consumer portfolio. We believe Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia together will provide consumers a compelling offering with comparables programming and a tangibly improved user experience.
Cricket is core to Australian culture and we have secured prime rights for 6 years with Cricket Australia. Fox Sports has plans to launch a dedicated cricket channel in the coming months to make the most of those rights. For the first time, fans will be able to watch the game without interruption where and when they want. 
Fox Sports will simulcast all cricket matches both in linear and digital formats and will have valuable exclusivity for a number of crucial encounters. The Cricket contract also means that we are now able to boast strong sports programming year-round, given our core NRL and IFL runs. And we are optimistic that our more complete sports offering will minimize churn. The coming year is obviously of vital importance, and we expect the repositioning to be followed by a renaissance of the company.
In summary, we are pleased with the revenue growth we've seen across every segment of our business. We cherish the strength of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads, the vigor of our Digital Real Estate and global Book Publishing businesses and the promise of a significant transformation of News Corp with the consolidated of Foxtel in the current quarter. The character of our company will be enhanced and our reported revenue and EBITDA will be boosted significantly. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."
212741644,559963478,1460068,"News Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert.Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EB",2002,"Thank you, Robert.
Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $182 million, down from $215 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.94 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The loss was primarily driven by the pretax noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia as we communicated in March and impairments related to News America Marketing, which totaled $165 million.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes [ both ] and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we closed the Foxtel transaction at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and those results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during quarter 4, which I'll discuss in a few moments.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenue for the quarter were $1.3 billion, up 2% versus the prior year, a slightly improved rate over the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed $50 million this quarter to revenues.
Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 3%, and circulation and subscription revenues increased 7% with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 3% and circulation and subscription revenues by 5%. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%, News UK rose 10%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 5%. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
News and Information segment EBITDA this quarter was $85 million, down 31% versus the prior year. You may also recall that last year's results include a $12 million benefit related to an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly. We also had higher expenses this quarter at News UK, much of which was timing-related.
Also a few highlights that I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circular [indiscernible] revenues grew 10%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from strong growth in The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which are up 24% year-over-year and up 7% or 101,000 versus our fiscal second quarter. 
we also saw an increase in subscriber ARPU at Dow Jones. In addition, we again saw strong year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times up 24% and at News Australia up 23%. At Dow Jones, we saw further revenue acceleration in the professional information business, which contributes to over 1/4 of the Dow Jones revenues. This past quarter, the professional information business posted 9% revenue growth, led by Risk and Compliance, which grew 45% and is on pace to exceed $100 million in total sales this year.
Advertising continues to be mixed across portfolio but overall showed slightly better performance than last quarter. The U.K. was again a solid performer, with advertising up 16% versus the prior year or 3% in local currency, similar to its Q2 performance, led by digital advertising growth and moderating print advertising declines, particularly at The Sun. News Australia advertising declined 5% versus the prior year or 9% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the second quarter rate.
Dow Jones advertising was down low double digits, improving on the trend from the second quarter, led by a strong performance in digital advertising. The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million, which represented about half of the decline this quarter.
Our cost initiatives are being centered around Australia, given the reliance on print advertising in that market. We have already significantly exceeded last year's AUD 40 million in cost savings during the first 9 months of the year and continue to look for additional efficiencies. We are also continuing to review our portfolio in Australia as we focus on improving our profitability. And globally, as we have done in the U.K., we are in discussions with industry participants about potentially sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies.
Finally, at News America Marketing, overall results were lower but saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter, benefiting from one additional insert and higher digital growth as we expected and communicated on the last earnings call.
Turning to our publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter led by strong lease and performances. Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $398 million and segment EBITDA increased 16% to $43 million. Total results from general books and Christian publishing drove overall performance this quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, this quarter benefited from the continued performance of The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn and strong performances from the back list. Overall, the back list contributed approximately 58% of revenues in the quarter, up from 52% last year, helping to drive higher margin.
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5% and represented 22% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year due to the strength in the downloadable audiobooks, which now comprises 25% of digital revenue.
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 27% to [ $279 million ] Reported segment EBITDA was up 17% to $88 million. REA Group revenues grew 35% due to very strong residential revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. While listing volumes were down modestly, partly due to an early [indiscernible] we saw relatively stable trends in both Melbourne and Sydney.
Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 15% to $115 million versus the prior year, driven by strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher customer flow and high yield. While core real estate revenues grew at a notably higher rate than the base growth rate, we saw slower growth in non-listing advertising revenues this quarter [indiscernible] to test reducing advertising in select markets to drive engagement and volume with early results encouraging.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 61 million for the quarter, rising 10% versus the prior year and reached 65 million in April. Move's operating expenses were higher this quarter, driven by planned incremental marketing to drive revenue growth and partly to increased traction in New York. We're also rebranding our core fleet of professional service ahead of the commercial launch in the next few months.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $7 million or 6% to $129 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $16 million from $34 million in the prior year, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization and higher programming costs related to the NRL, which led to approximately $22 million higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million of expenditure related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The bulk of the transaction costs will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses of affiliates of $974 million reflects the $957 million noncash write-down of the carrying value of Foxtel in the quarter as we had previously disclosed in March. This compares with negative $23 million in the prior year period. 
Foxtel revenues for the third quarter declined 1% to $587 million, and EBITDA decreased 21% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $80 million, primarily related to The Australian Football League rights and carriage fees for Fox Sports Australia as well as lower revenues.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of March 31, up nearly 1% versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, which were offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of T-Box subscribers as part of the planned wind-down in the quarter.
In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 15.4%, down from 16.1% and ARPU was down 1%. 
In early April, we completed the transaction with Telstra to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company, in which News Corp now owns 65%. The Foxtel results would be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during the fourth quarter, and it will also include approximately $1.7 billion of debt. 
As a consequence of the transaction, there will be some initial reinvestment required to improve the earnings and subscriber trajectory. To that end, one big step, as Robert highlighted, was securing long-term domestic cricket rights, which will now materially improve Fox Sports offering focusing on both subscriber volume and churn.
On the core broadcast business, our goal will be to maintain the subscriber base and manage churn effectively. We are progressing with the rollout of iQ3, which is showing promising signs on churn reduction and ARPU lift and today has been deployed to approximately 1/4 of our broadcast base. We expect to continue to expand penetration of new set-top boxes and also to develop a next-generation box within customer features. 
Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative. This past fiscal year, our product development was focused on launching an IT version of our broadcast offering, which has helped to extend our reach and capture more of the affordable segments. Our goal in fiscal '19 is to launch new sports and nonsports products built on an IP-only platform targeted at specific demographics. With new management in the business, we are reviewing the cost base looking across content and operations to deliver further efficiencies and to ensure the business is rightsized to deliver the new initiatives.
Looking to the fourth quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, advertising trends [indiscernible] broadly in line with the third quarter. However, we do expect slightly higher marketing costs in the fourth quarter at Dow Jones, mostly related to driving higher digital paid subscriber growth.
At Fox Sports and Foxtel, we will consolidate Foxtel in the fourth quarter, which will be reflected in newly formed segment called Subscription Video Services, which will also include the Australian News Channel operators Overall, we expect subscriber trends at Foxtel to be relatively similar to the prior quarter but do expect some additional OTT investments.
Results in the segment are also expected to include transaction costs in the $10 million to $15 million range. In Book Publishing, we expect to realize over $20 million in additional revenues in the fourth quarter from the agreement with Amazon to license The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien for a TV series. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, which should show some improvement in listing volumes, helped by the absence of Easter. And like the third quarter, we anticipate higher investment spending at Move to drive traffic and support new products.
While we're in the process of completing our purchase price allocation of Foxtel and evaluating the related impact from the profit and loss, there are a few items below the line worth mentioning regarding the Foxtel consolidation. 
Foxtel standalone depreciation and amortization for the first 9 months totaled $187 million, including $69 million for the quarter. In addition, we have also amortized an additional $49 million and $17 million for the first 9 months of the quarter and the quarter, respectively, related to the excess cost of our 50% share of the business that we acquired by the acquisition in 2012. 
Foxtel results would be removed from the equity income and the 35% stake Telstra owns at the combined company will be reflected in minority interest going forward. We will also consolidate Foxtel's interest expense, which will reflect the $1.7 billion in debt that we will include on our balance sheet.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And overall, the audience at realtor in the quarter was 61 million monthly. That was up 10% in April, 65 million. So we're still seeing continued growth not only in New York but around the country. And there's much discussion at the moment about the general health of the housing market in the U.S., so listing volumes down about 7.2% year-on-year at present. But when you look at the broader trends in the U.S. economy, we're clearly going through a phase of, at least I would argue, en route to significantly more liquidity. The March seasonally adjusted annualized figures for sales around [ 5.6 million ] The median sales price was up 5.8% to around [ $250,400 ] and significantly the number of homes in the U.S. seriously underwater. In Q2 2012, that was [ 28.6 ] of U.S. homes seriously underwater. That's down to 9.5% of homes. And given that the issue at the market at the moment is not a problem of demand but a problem with supply and a compounding factor in the past has been a lack of job security, what with the strengthening of the U.S. job market, you'll see more people more confident about moving homes to a better job, job means mobility, mobility means people moving and that will be good for business."

We're seeing broad-based interest in The Journal. Obviously, it's a business [indiscernible] publication but also one with general appeal for a certain demographic and that is quite broad. The other thing to bear in mind with those subscriptions is that each of them is an opportunity to upsell to higher-priced high-yielding professional information. From a broader perspective, our concern has not just been for our publications, which, of course, is our prime concern, but also for an ecosystem which was digitally dysfunctional, one in which premium content was actually diminished in stature by the very fact that in Google Search, as you won't be able to find it. That has changed and we applaud that measure by Google. But as I mentioned, that's really step 1 on the pathway to provenance. So we're engaged and thankfully, these days, unlike the past, many more publishers are engaged not only in the U.S. but globally. And also more governments are engaged in the debate over what the digital landscape should like. And with more focus on that ecosystem, more focus on provenance, there should be more opportunity for us for more profits."

In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. The com",1892,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. 
The company continues to deliver on its strategic mission to become increasingly global and digital, with an ever-greater focus on collaboration and innovation, and that focus is evident from this quarter's results. We are particularly pleased with the progress in Digital Real Estate, where revenues grew 27%, and we fortified the business for future growth. Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $182 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.
It's worth highlighting that for the first 9 months, reported revenues were $6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, a noncash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America Marketing.
Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the Digital Real Estate Services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel-Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of our volatile advertising market.
The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months, as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corp, under the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.
The end of Google's prejudicial First Click Free policy, which punished high-quality journalism, has already benefited our mastheads, and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is, however, just the first step on the pathway to prominence. 
We and other publishers are also in discussion with Facebook, which certainly professes concern about virtue and veracity. While authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance an experience that is being polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. 
The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. These algorithms are already potent, but they are destined to be much more formidable. And their abundance, potential to skew news and skew our customers needs to be better understood and monitored. 
And an Algorithm Review Board, or ARB, would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our mastheads, our journalism and our advertising clients, who are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses, but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.
Now let's examine in more detail this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which continue to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter, and Tracy Fellows and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients, while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the site. 
REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by its emerging financial services business. REA gained traction with its home mortgage operations. And as of the end of March, had more than 0.25 million self-completed financial profiles. Given the concern about the financial services industry in Australia, the team perceives an opening for a business that truly focus on customers' needs and aspirations. Meanwhile, REA saw strong traffic growth in Southeast Asia with signs of improving revenue trends from the previous quarter, in a market that is still in the early days of its digital evolution.
Last week, REA announced the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, a provider of innovative property data to the financial services sector. This will allow REA to deliver an increasing flow of insightful intelligence to customers and consumers, and should further strengthen its position at the heart of the Australian property market.
At Move, there was 15% revenue growth, overall, with a healthy 19% coming from its core real estate business. It was a robust performance in the lead base connections with biased product as well as strong audience growth and more intense engagement.
In the next few months, realty.com will be launching Realsuite, a mobile-based system which will enable advertisers to provide the best possible service to their clients, increasing responsiveness, highlighting meaningful leads and providing consumers with the level of service they expect throughout the transaction process. 
Meanwhile, we note with much interest that Zillow is expanding its Instant Offers program. Understandably, agents and brokers are eyeing this move with legitimate concern, as we believe Zillow's focus on house flipping is indicative of its long-term intent. Our very close relationship with agents and brokers is even more valuable today as we work with the industry to drive high-quality lead volume and provide sophisticated market intelligence to sellers and buyers.
At News and Information Services, while print advertising remains challenging, we saw an overall improvement in advertising trends in the third quarter. News UK reported the second consecutive quarter of ad revenue growth for the first time in 7 years. And under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, all our U.K. mastheads gained market share in circulation. 
Also in the U.K., Wireless Group experienced strong listenership and improved revenues compared to the prior year, with standout performances at Virgin Radio and talkRADIO. Wireless' audience growth has outpaced the U.K. radio market, in general, based on the latest radio data. talkSPORT is also looking forward, expectantly, to its coverage of the World Cup this June. Clearly, audience interest will, in part, depend on England's on-field exploits. Let us hope that past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Unruly had another strong quarter, driven by growth in the U.S., U.K. and Japan as programmatic continues to burgeon. Unruly's consistent innovation in the ad distribution market and its provision of authenticated audiences make it particularly valuable at a time when advertisers are questioning value and veracity.
At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal's digital-only subscriber growth was 24% year-over-year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones, again, increased 10% as our publications served a growing public demand for a timely and reliable news. Total subscribers across Dow Jones recently passed its 3 million target based on preliminary internal metrics, and we expect continued growth in coming quarters.
Revenues at the Professional Information Business expanded 9%, led by the sterling performance of Risk and Compliance, with 45% year-over-year growth in its revenues. Reducing risk and ensuring compliance are clearly imperatives for our corporate clients.
While advertising declined overall, it did so at a slower rate compared to Q2, driven by low teens digital ad growth. The New York Post had strong advertising and audience numbers with 87 million uniques in March, a 72% year-over-year spike. In Australia, we made progress in reviewing our regional papers and continue to focus on core metro titles and The Australian, streamlining the business and improving operating efficiencies. Digital paid subscribers in News Corp Australian grew 23% and we also saw robust digital ad revenue growth.
One final note for the News and Information Services segment. Taken together, our premium publications, The Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian, experienced an average growth in digital subscriptions for Q3 of more than 20%, a testament to the success of the digital transformation of these mastheads.
In Book Publishing, we experienced a strong quarter with robust revenue and profitability at HarperCollins. This success was driven in part by best-selling U.S. titles such as A.J. Finn's The Woman In The Window, the only debut work of fiction in the past 12 years to immediately reach #1, and the continuing strength of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. 
Notably, our Christian publishing arm performed well with one of the year's best-performing titles, Kathie Lee Gifford's The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi, and renewed interest in the works of Billy Graham. Brain Murray's team continues to look for ways to leverage our global platform, including an important pact with best-selling author, Daniel Silva, acquiring the world rights to 6 more of his books starting with The Other Woman in July 2018.
We have finalized a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, underscoring the power of our back list. We expect to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as a result of this deal.
We're excited about the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, giving News Corp 65% of the business and our partners at Telstra of 35%. This agreement creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and comes at a time when over-the-top is becoming a significant part of our consumer portfolio. We believe Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, together, will provide consumers a compelling offering with incomparable programming and a tangibly improved user experience.
Cricket is core to Australian culture, and we have secured prime rights for 6 years with Cricket Australia. Fox Sports has plans to launch a dedicated cricket channel in the coming months to make the most of those rights. For the first time, fans will be able to watch the game without interruption where and when they want. 
Fox Sports will simulcast all cricket matches both in linear and digital formats, and will have valuable exclusivity for a number of crucial encounters. The Cricket contract also means that we are now able to boast strong sports programming year-round, given our core NRL and IFL rights. And we are optimistic that our more complete sports offering will minimize churn. The coming year is, obviously, of vital importance and we expect the repositioning to be followed by a renaissance of the company.
In summary, we are pleased with the revenue growth we've seen across every segment of our business. We cherish the strength of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads, the vigor of our Digital Real Estate and global Book Publishing businesses and the promise of a significant transformation of News Corp with the consolidation of Foxtel in the current quarter. The character of our company will be enhanced and our reported revenue and EBITDA will be boosted significantly. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."
212741644,559963478,1460389,"News Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBI",2021,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $182 million, down from $215 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.94 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The loss was primarily driven by the pretax noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, as we communicated in March, and impairments related to News America Marketing which totaled $165 million.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes those and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we closed the Foxtel transaction at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and those results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during quarter 4, which I'll discuss in a few moments.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenue for the quarter were $1.3 billion, up 2% versus the prior year, a slightly improved indiscernible] over the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed $50 million this quarter to revenue.
Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 3%, and circulation and subscription revenues increased 7%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 3% and circulation and subscription revenues by 5%. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%, News UK rose 10%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 5%. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
News and Information segment EBITDA this quarter was $85 million, down 31% versus the prior year. You may also recall that last year's results included a $12 million benefit related to an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly. We also had higher expenses this quarter at News UK, much of which was timing related.
Also, a few highlights that I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from strong growth in The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 24% year-over-year and up 7%, or 101,000, versus our fiscal second quarter. 
Pleasingly, we also saw an increase in subscriber ARPU at Dow Jones. In addition, we again saw strong year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times up 24% and at News Australia up 23%. At Dow Jones, we saw further revenue acceleration in the professional information business, which contributes to over 1/4 of the Dow Jones revenues. This past quarter, the Professional Information Business posted 9% revenue growth, led by Risk and Compliance, which grew 45%, and is on pace to exceed $100 million in total sales this year.
Advertising continues to be mixed across our news portfolio, but overall showed slightly better performance than last quarter. The U.K. was again a solid performer with advertising up 16% versus the prior year, or 3% in local currency, similar to its Q2 performance, led by digital advertising growth and moderating print advertising declines, particularly at The Sun. News Australia advertising declined 5% versus the prior year, or 9% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the second quarter rate.
Dow Jones advertising was down low double digits, improving on the trend from the second quarter, led by a strong performance in digital advertising. The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million, which represented about half of the decline this quarter.
Our cost initiatives are being centered around Australia, given the reliance on print advertising in that market. We have already significantly exceeded last year's AUD 40 million in cost savings during the first 9 months of the year, and continue to look for additional efficiencies. We are also continuing to review our portfolio in Australia as we focus on improving our profitability. And globally, as we have done in the U.K., we are in discussions with industry participants about potentially sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies.
Finally, at News America Marketing, overall results were lower but saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter benefiting from one additional insert and higher digital growth, as we expected and communicated on the last earnings call.
Turning to our publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter led by strong front list and back list performances. Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $398 million and segment EBITDA increased 16% to $43 million. Total results from general books and Christian publishing drove overall performance this quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, this quarter benefited from the continued performance of The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn and strong performances from the back list. Overall, the back list contributed approximately 58% of revenues in the quarter, up from 52% last year, helping to drive higher margin.
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5% and represented 22% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year, due to the strength in the downloadable audiobooks which now comprises 25% of digital revenue. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 27% to $279 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 17% to $88 million. REA Group revenues grew 35% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. While listing volumes were down modestly, partly due to an early Easter, we saw relatively stable trends in both Melbourne and Sydney. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 15% to $115 million versus the prior year driven by strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher customer flow and higher yield. While core real estate revenues grew at a notably higher rate than the base growth rate, we saw slower growth in non-listing advertising revenues this quarter as part of a plan to test reducing advertising loads in select markets to drive engagement and lead volume, with early results encouraging.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 61 million for the quarter, rising 10% versus the prior year, and reached 65 million in April. Move's operating expenses were higher this quarter, driven by planned incremental marketing to drive revenue growth and partly to increased traction in New York. We are also rebranding our core fleet of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the next few months.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $7 million, or 6%, to $129 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $16 million from $34 million in the prior year, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization and higher programming costs related to the NRL, which led to approximately $22 million higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million of expenditure related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The bulk of the transaction costs will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses of affiliates of $974 million reflects the $957 million noncash write-down of the carrying value of Foxtel in the quarter, as we had previously disclosed in March. This compares with negative $23 million in the prior year period. 
Foxtel revenues for the third quarter declined 1% to $587 million, and EBITDA decreased 21% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $80 million, primarily related to The Australian Football League rights and carriage fees for Fox Sports Australia as well as lower revenues.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of March 31, up nearly 1% versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, which were offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of T-Box subscribers, as part of the planned wind-down in the quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn were 15.4%, down from 16.1% and ARPU was down 1%. 
In early April, we completed the transaction with Telstra to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company, in which News Corp now owns 65%. The Foxtel results would be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during the fourth quarter, and it will also include approximately $1.7 billion of debt. 
As a consequence of the transaction, there will be some initial reinvestment required to improve the earnings and subscriber trajectory. To that end, one big step, as Robert highlighted, was securing long-term domestic Cricket rights, which will now materially improve Fox Sports with some offering, focusing on both subscriber volume and churn.
On the core broadcast business, our goal will be to maintain the subscriber base and manage churn effectively. We are progressing with the rollout of iQ3, which is showing promising signs on churn reduction and ARPU lift, and today has been deployed to approximately 1/4 of our broadcast base. We expect to continue to expand penetration of new set-top boxes and also to develop a next-generation box [indiscernible] customer features. 
Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative. This past fiscal year, our product development was focused on launching an IT version of our broadcast offering, which has helped to extend our reach and capture more of the affordable segments. Our goal in fiscal '19 is to launch new sports and non-sports products built on an IP-only platform targeted at specific demographics. With new management in the business, we are reviewing the cost base looking across content and operations to deliver further efficiencies and to ensure the business is rightsized to deliver the new initiative.
Looking to the fourth quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, advertising trends, so far, appear broadly in line with the third quarter. However, we do expect slightly higher marketing costs in the fourth quarter at Dow Jones, mostly related to driving higher digital paid subscriber growth.
At Fox Sports and Foxtel, we will consolidate Foxtel in the fourth quarter, which will be reflected in newly formed segment called Subscription Video Services, which will also include the Australian News Channel operator, Sky News. Overall, we expect subscriber trends at Foxtel to be relatively similar to the prior quarter, but do expect some additional OTT investment.
Results in the segment are also expected to include transaction costs in the $10 million to $15 million range. In Book Publishing, we expect to realize over $20 million in additional revenues in the fourth quarter from the agreement with Amazon to license The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien for a TV series. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, which should show some improvement in listing volumes, helped by the absence of Easter. And like the third quarter, we anticipate higher investment spending at Move to drive traffic and support new products.
While we're in the process of completing our purchase price allocation of Foxtel and evaluating the related impact from the profit and loss, there are a few items below the line worth mentioning regarding the Foxtel consolidation. 
Foxtel standalone depreciation and amortization for the first 9 months totaled $187 million, including $69 million for the quarter. In addition, we have also amortized an additional $49 million and $17 million for the first 9 months of the quarter and the quarter, respectively, related to the excess cost of our 50% share of the business that we acquired by the CMH acquisition in 2012. 
Foxtel results will be removed from the equity income and the 35% stake Telstra owns at the combined company will be reflected in minority interest going forward. We will also consolidate Foxtel's interest expense, which will reflect the $1.7 billion in debt that we will include on our balance sheet.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And overall, the audience at realtor in the quarter was 61 million monthly. That was up 10% in April, 65 million. So we're still seeing continued growth not only in New York, but around the country. And there's much discussion at the moment about the general health of the housing market in the U.S., so listing volumes down about 7.2% year-on-year at present. But when you look at the broader trends in the U.S. economy, we're clearly going through a phase -- at least I would argue, en route to significantly more liquidity. The March seasonally adjusted annualized figures for sales around 5.6 million. The median sales price was up 5.8% to around $250,400. And significantly, the number of homes in the U.S. seriously underwater, in Q2 2012, that was 28.6% of U.S. homes seriously underwater. That's down to 9.5% of homes. And given the issue at the market, at the moment, is not a problem of demand but a problem with supply and a compounding factor in the past has been a lack of job security. What -- with the strengthening of the U.S. job market, you'll see more people more confident about moving homes to a better job. Job mobility means mobility -- mobility means people moving and that will be good for business."

We're seeing broad-based interest in The Journal. Obviously, it's a business-oriented publication, but also one with general appeal for a certain demographic and that is quite broad. The other thing to bear in mind with those subscriptions is that each of them is an opportunity to upsell to higher-priced, high-yielding professional information. From a broader perspective, our concern has not just been for our publications which, of course, is our prime concern, but also for an ecosystem which was digitally dysfunctional. One in which premium content was actually diminished in stature by the very fact that, in Google Search, as you weren't basically able to find it. That has changed and we applaud that measure by Google. But as I mentioned, that's really step 1 on the pathway to provenance. So we're engaged and thankfully these days, unlike the past, many more publishers are engaged not only in the U.S. but globally. And also more governments are engaged in the debate over what the digital landscape should like. And with more focus on that ecosystem, more focus on provenance, there should be more opportunity for us for more profits."

But we have had tremendous success with both negotiations over in the U.K. and we've had much success.

In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. The com",1894,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. 
The company continues to deliver on its strategic mission to become increasingly global and digital, with an ever-greater focus on collaboration and innovation, and that focus is evident from this quarter's results. We are particularly pleased with the progress in Digital Real Estate, where revenues grew 27%, and we fortified the business for future growth. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $182 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.
It's worth highlighting that for the first 9 months, reported revenues were $6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, a noncash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America Marketing.
Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the Digital Real Estate Services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel-Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of our volatile advertising market.
The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months, as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corp, under the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.
The end of Google's prejudicial First Click Free policy, which punished high-quality journalism, has already benefited our mastheads, and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is, however, just the first step on the pathway to prominence. 
We and other publishers are also in discussion with Facebook, which certainly professes concern about virtue and veracity. While authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance an experience that is being polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. 
The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. 
These algorithms are already potent, but they are destined to be much more formidable. And their abundance, potential to skew news and skew our customers' needs to be better understood and monitored. 
And an Algorithm Review Board, or ARB, would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our mastheads, our journalism and our advertising clients, who are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses, but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.
Now let's examine in more detail this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which continue to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter, and Tracey Fellows and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients, while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the site. 
REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by its emerging financial services business. 
REA gained traction with its home mortgage operations. And as of the end of March, had more than 0.25 million self-completed financial profiles. Given the concern about the financial services industry in Australia, the team perceives an opening for a business that truly focus on customers' needs and aspirations. 
Meanwhile, REA saw strong traffic growth in Southeast Asia with signs of improving revenue trends from the previous quarter, in a market that is still in the early days of its digital evolution.
Last week, REA announced the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, a provider of innovative property data to the financial services sector. This will allow REA to deliver an increasing flow of insightful intelligence to customers and consumers, and should further strengthen its position at the heart of the Australian property market.
At Move, there was 15% revenue growth, overall, with a healthy 19% coming from its core real estate business. It was a robust performance in the lead base Connections for Buyers product as well as strong audience growth and more intense engagement.
In the next few months, realtor.com will be launching Realsuite, a mobile-based system which will enable advertisers to provide the best possible service to their clients, increasing responsiveness, highlighting meaningful leads and providing consumers with the level of service they expect throughout the transaction process. 
Meanwhile, we note with much interest that Zillow is expanding its Instant Offers program. Understandably, agents and brokers are eyeing this move with legitimate concern, as we believe Zillow's focus on house flipping is indicative of its long-term intent. Our very close relationship with agents and brokers is even more valuable today as we work with the industry to drive high-quality lead volume and provide sophisticated market intelligence to sellers and buyers.
At News and Information Services, while print advertising remains challenging, we saw an overall improvement in advertising trends in the third quarter. News UK reported the second consecutive quarter of ad revenue growth for the first time in 7 years. And under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, all our U.K. mastheads gained market share in circulation. 
Also in the U.K., Wireless Group experienced strong listenership and improved revenues compared to the prior year, with standout performances at Virgin Radio and talkRADIO. Wireless' audience growth has outpaced the U.K. radio market, in general, based on the latest [ radio ] data. talkSPORT is also looking forward, expectantly, to its coverage of the World Cup this June. Clearly, audience interest will, in part, depend on England's on-field exploits. Let us hope that past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Unruly had another strong quarter, driven by growth in the U.S., U.K. and Japan as programmatic continues to burgeon. Unruly's consistent innovation in the ad distribution market and its provision of authenticated audiences make it particularly valuable at a time when advertisers are questioning value and veracity.
At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal's digital-only subscriber growth was 24% year-over-year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones, again, increased 10% as our publications served a growing public demand for a timely and reliable news. Total subscribers across Dow Jones recently passed its 3 million target based on preliminary internal metrics, and we expect continued growth in coming quarters.
Revenues at the Professional Information Business expanded 9%, led by the sterling performance of Risk and Compliance, with 45% year-over-year growth in its revenues. Reducing risk and ensuring compliance are clearly imperatives for our corporate clients.
While advertising declined overall, it did so at a slower rate compared to Q2, driven by low teens digital ad growth. The New York Post had strong advertising and audience numbers with 87 million uniques in March, a 72% year-over-year spike. In Australia, we made progress in reviewing our regional papers and continue to focus on core metro titles and The Australian, streamlining the business and improving operating efficiencies. Digital paid subscribers in News Corp Australian grew 23% and we also saw robust digital ad revenue growth.
One final note for the News and Information Services segment. Taken together, our premium publications, The Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian, experienced an average growth in digital subscriptions for Q3 of more than 20%, a testament to the success of the digital transformation of these mastheads.
In Book Publishing, we experienced a strong quarter with robust revenue and profitability at HarperCollins. This success was driven in part by best-selling U.S. titles such as A.J. Finn's The Woman In The Window, the only debut work of fiction in the past 12 years to immediately reach #1, and the continuing strength of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. 
Notably, our Christian publishing arm performed well with one of the year's best-performing titles, Kathie Lee Gifford's The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi, and renewed interest in the works of Billy Graham. Brain Murray's team continues to look for ways to leverage our global platform, including an important pact with best-selling author, Daniel Silva, acquiring the world rights to 6 more of his books starting with The Other Woman in July 2018.
We have finalized a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, underscoring the power of our back list. We expect to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as a result of this deal.
We're excited about the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, giving News Corp 65% of the business and our partners at Telstra of 35%. This agreement creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and comes at a time when over-the-top is becoming a significant part of our consumer portfolio. We believe Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, together, will provide consumers a compelling offering with incomparable programming and a tangibly improved user experience.
Cricket is core to Australian culture, and we have secured prime rights for 6 years with Cricket Australia. Fox Sports has plans to launch a dedicated cricket channel in the coming months to make the most of those rights. For the first time, fans will be able to watch the game without interruption where and when they want. 
Fox Sports will simulcast all cricket matches both in linear and digital formats, and will have valuable exclusivity for a number of crucial encounters. The cricket contract also means that we are now able to boast strong sports programming year-round, given our core NRL and IFL rights. And we are optimistic that our more complete sports offering will minimize churn. The coming year is, obviously, of vital importance and we expect the repositioning to be followed by a renaissance of the company.
In summary, we are pleased with the revenue growth we've seen across every segment of our business. We cherish the strength of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads, the vigor of our Digital Real Estate and global Book Publishing businesses and the promise of a significant transformation of News Corp with the consolidation of Foxtel in the current quarter. The character of our company will be enhanced and our reported revenue and EBITDA will be boosted significantly. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."
212741644,559963478,1460587,"News Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBI",2026,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $182 million, down from $215 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.94 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The loss was primarily driven by the pretax noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, as we communicated in March, and impairments related to News America Marketing which totaled $165 million.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes those and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we closed the Foxtel transaction at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and those results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during quarter 4, which I'll discuss in a few moments.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenue for the quarter were $1.3 billion, up 2% versus the prior year, a slightly improved rate over the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed $50 million this quarter to revenue.
Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 3%, and circulation and subscription revenues increased 7%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 3% and circulation and subscription revenues by 5%. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%, News UK rose 10%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 5%. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
News and Information segment EBITDA this quarter was $85 million, down 31% versus the prior year. You may also recall that last year's results included a $12 million benefit related to an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly. We also had higher expenses this quarter at News UK, much of which was timing related.
There are also a few highlights that I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from strong growth in The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 24% year-over-year and up 7%, or 101,000, versus our fiscal second quarter. 
Pleasingly, we also saw an increase in subscriber ARPU at Dow Jones. In addition, we again saw strong year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times up 24% and at News Australia up 23%. At Dow Jones, we saw further revenue acceleration in the professional information business, which contributes to over 1/4 of the Dow Jones revenues. This past quarter, the Professional Information Business posted 9% revenue growth, led by Risk and Compliance, which grew 45%, and is on pace to exceed $100 million in total sales this year.
Advertising continues to be mixed across our news portfolio, but overall showed slightly better performance than last quarter. The U.K. was again a solid performer with advertising up 16% versus the prior year, or 3% in local currency, similar to its Q2 performance, led by digital advertising growth and moderating print advertising declines, particularly at The Sun. News Australia advertising declined 5% versus the prior year, or 9% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the second quarter rate.
Dow Jones advertising was down low double digits, improving on the trend from the second quarter, led by a strong performance in digital advertising. The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million, which represented about half of the decline this quarter.
Our cost initiatives are being centered around Australia, given the reliance on print advertising in that market. We have already significantly exceeded last year's AUD 40 million in cost savings during the first 9 months of the year, and continue to look for additional efficiencies. We are also continuing to review our portfolio in Australia as we focus on improving our profitability. And globally, as we have done in the U.K., we are in discussions with industry participants about potentially sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies.
Finally, at News America Marketing, overall results were lower but saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter benefiting from one additional insert and higher digital growth, as we expected and communicated on the last earnings call.
Turning to our publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter led by strong front list and back list performances. Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $398 million and segment EBITDA increased 16% to $43 million. Total results from general books and Christian publishing drove overall performance this quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, this quarter benefited from the continued performance of The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn and strong performances from the back list. Overall, the back list contributed approximately 58% of revenues in the quarter, up from 52% last year, helping to drive higher margin.
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5% and represented 22% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year, due to the strength in the downloadable audiobooks which now comprises 25% of digital revenue. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 27% to $279 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 17% to $88 million. REA Group revenues grew 35% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. 
While listing volumes were down modestly, partly due to an early Easter, we saw relatively stable trends in both Melbourne and Sydney. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 15% to $115 million versus the prior year driven by strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher customer flow and higher yield. While core real estate revenues grew at a notably higher rate than the base growth rate, we saw slower growth in non-listing advertising revenues this quarter as part of a plan to test reducing advertising loads in select markets to drive engagement and lead volume, with early results encouraging.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 61 million for the quarter, rising 10% versus the prior year, and reached 65 million in April. Move's operating expenses were higher this quarter, driven by planned incremental marketing to drive revenue growth and partly to increased traction in New York. We are also rebranding our core fleet of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the next few months.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $7 million, or 6%, to $129 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $16 million from $34 million in the prior year, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization and higher programming costs related to the NRL, which led to approximately $22 million higher costs this quarter. 
We also incurred approximately $2 million of expenditure related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The bulk of the transaction costs will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses of affiliates of $974 million reflects the $957 million noncash write-down of the carrying value of Foxtel in the quarter, as we had previously disclosed in March. This compares with negative $23 million in the prior year period. 
Foxtel revenues for the third quarter declined 1% to $587 million, and EBITDA decreased 21% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $80 million, primarily related to The Australian Football League rights and carriage fees for Fox Sports Australia as well as lower revenues.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of March 31, up nearly 1% versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, which were offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of T-Box subscribers, as part of the planned wind-down in the quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn were 15.4%, down from 16.1% and ARPU was down 1%. 
In early April, we completed the transaction with Telstra to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company, in which News Corp now owns 65%. The Foxtel results would be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during the fourth quarter, and it will also include approximately $1.7 billion of debt. 
As a consequence of the transaction, there will be some initial reinvestment required to improve the earnings and subscriber trajectory. To that end, one big step, as Robert highlighted, was securing long-term domestic Cricket rights, which will now materially improve Fox Sports with some offering, focusing on both subscriber volume and churn.
On the core broadcast business, our goal will be to maintain the subscriber base and manage churn effectively. We are progressing with the rollout of iQ3, which is showing promising signs on churn reduction and ARPU lift, and today has been deployed to approximately 1/4 of our broadcast base. We expect to continue to expand penetration of new set-top boxes and also to develop a next-generation box with enhanced customer features. 
Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative. This past fiscal year, our product development was focused on launching an IT version of our broadcast offering, which has helped to extend our reach and capture more of the affordable segments. Our goal in fiscal '19 is to launch new sports and non-sports products built on an IP-only platform targeted at specific demographics. 
With new management in the business, we are reviewing the cost base looking across content and operations to deliver further efficiencies and to ensure the business is rightsized to deliver the new initiatives.
Looking to the fourth quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, advertising trends, so far, appear broadly in line with the third quarter. However, we do expect slightly higher marketing costs in the fourth quarter at Dow Jones, mostly related to driving higher digital paid subscriber growth.
At Fox Sports and Foxtel, we will consolidate Foxtel in the fourth quarter, which will be reflected in newly formed segment called [ Subscription Video Services ], which will also include the Australian News Channel operator, Sky News. Overall, we expect subscriber trends at Foxtel to be relatively similar to the prior quarter, but do expect some additional OTT investment.
Results in the segment are also expected to include transaction costs in the $10 million to $15 million range. In Book Publishing, we expect to realize over $20 million in additional revenues in the fourth quarter from the agreement with Amazon to license The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien for a TV series. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, which should show some improvement in listing volumes, helped by the absence of Easter. And like the third quarter, we anticipate higher investment spending at Move to drive traffic and support new products.
While we're in the process of completing our purchase price allocation of Foxtel and evaluating the related impact from the profit and loss, there are a few items below the line worth mentioning regarding the Foxtel consolidation. 
Foxtel standalone depreciation and amortization for the first 9 months totaled $187 million, including $69 million for the quarter. In addition, we have also amortized an additional $49 million and $17 million for the first 9 months of the quarter and the quarter, respectively, related to the excess cost of our 50% share of the business that we acquired by the CMH acquisition in 2012. 
Foxtel results will be removed from the equity income and the 35% stake Telstra owns at the combined company will be reflected in minority interest going forward. We will also consolidate Foxtel's interest expense, which will reflect the $1.7 billion in debt that we will include on our balance sheet.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And overall, the audience at realtor in the quarter was 61 million monthly. That was up 10% in April, 65 million. So we're still seeing continued growth not only in New York, but around the country. And there's much discussion at the moment about the general health of the housing market in the U.S., so listing volumes down about 7.2% year-on-year at present. But when you look at the broader trends in the U.S. economy, we're clearly going through a phase -- at least I would argue, en route to significantly more liquidity. The March seasonally adjusted annualized figures for sales are around $5.6 million. The median sales price was up 5.8% to around $250,400. And significantly, the number of homes in the U.S. seriously underwater, in Q2 2012, that was 28.6% of U.S. homes seriously underwater. That's down to 9.5% of homes. And given the issue at the market, at the moment, is not a problem of demand but a problem with supply and a compounding factor in the past has been a lack of job security. What -- with the strengthening of the U.S. job market, you'll see more people more confident about moving homes to a better job. Job mobility means mobility -- mobility means people moving and that will be good for business."

We're seeing broad-based interest in The Journal. Obviously, it's a business-oriented publication, but also one with general appeal for a certain demographic and that is quite broad. The other thing to bear in mind with those subscriptions is that each of them is an opportunity to upsell to higher-priced, high-yielding professional information. From a broader perspective, our concern has not just been for our publications which, of course, is our prime concern, but also for an ecosystem which was digitally dysfunctional. One in which premium content was actually diminished in stature by the very fact that, in Google Search, as you weren't basically able to find it. That has changed and we applaud that measure by Google. But as I mentioned, that's really step 1 on the pathway to provenance. So we're engaged and thankfully these days, unlike the past, many more publishers are engaged not only in the U.S. but globally. And also more governments are engaged in the debate over what the digital landscape should [ look ] like. And with more focus on that ecosystem, more focus on provenance, there should be more opportunity for us for more profits."

It's a little early for us to give you details, meaningful details about the level of investment in the coming year. But as Susan mentioned, we will be focusing on the development of OTT and frankly, addressing issues that in the past have been problematic at Foxtel around the user interface.

And we're also looking to improve the customer service, obviously, in order to get more customers in. We've also mentioned that we're looking to expand the OTT propositions, and we want to look at sport as well as non-sports genres, but we also are rightsizing the cost base. So there's been a lot of cost work actually done today, so even before the merger happened.

Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $182 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.
It's worth highlighting that for the first 9 months, reported revenues were $6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, a noncash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America Marketing.
Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the Digital Real Estate Services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel-Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of our volatile advertising market.
The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months, as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corp, under the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.
The end of Google's prejudicial First Click Free policy, which punished high-quality journalism, has already benefited our mastheads, and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is, however, just the first step on the pathway to prominence. 
We and other publishers are also in discussion with Facebook, which certainly professes concern about virtue and veracity. While authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance an experience that is being polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. 
The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. 
These algorithms are already potent, but they are destined to be much more formidable. And their abundance, potential to skew news and skew our customers' needs to be better understood and monitored. 
And an Algorithm Review Board, or ARB, would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our mastheads, our journalism and our advertising clients, who are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses, but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.
Now let's examine in more detail this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which continue to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter, and Tracey Fellows and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients, while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the site. 
REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by its emerging financial services business. 
REA gained traction with its home mortgage operations. And as of the end of March, had more than 0.25 million self-completed financial profiles. Given the concern about the financial services industry in Australia, the team perceives an opening for a business that truly focus on customers' needs and aspirations. 
Meanwhile, REA saw strong traffic growth in Southeast Asia with signs of improving revenue trends from the previous quarter, in a market that is still in the early days of its digital evolution.
Last week, REA announced the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, a provider of innovative property data to the financial services sector. This will allow REA to deliver an increasing flow of insightful intelligence to customers and consumers, and should further strengthen its position at the heart of the Australian property market.
At Move, there was 15% revenue growth, overall, with a healthy 19% coming from its core real estate business. It was a robust performance in the lead base Connections for Buyers product as well as strong audience growth and more intense engagement.
In the next few months, realtor.com will be launching Realsuite, a mobile-based system which will enable advertisers to provide the best possible service to their clients, increasing responsiveness, highlighting meaningful leads and providing consumers with the level of service they expect throughout the transaction process. 
Meanwhile, we note with much interest that Zillow is expanding its Instant Offers program. Understandably, agents and brokers are eyeing this move with legitimate concern, as we believe Zillow's focus on house flipping is indicative of its long-term intent. Our very close relationship with agents and brokers is even more valuable today as we work with the industry to drive high-quality lead volume and provide sophisticated market intelligence to sellers and buyers.
At News and Information Services, while print advertising remains challenging, we saw an overall improvement in advertising trends in the third quarter. News UK reported the second consecutive quarter of ad revenue growth for the first time in 7 years. And under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, all our U.K. mastheads gained market share in circulation. 
Also in the U.K., Wireless Group experienced strong listenership and improved revenues compared to the prior year, with standout performances at Virgin Radio and talkRADIO. Wireless' audience growth has outpaced the U.K. radio market, in general, based on the latest [ radio ] data. talkSPORT is also looking forward, expectantly, to its coverage of the World Cup this June. Clearly, audience interest will, in part, depend on England's on-field exploits. Let us hope that past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Unruly had another strong quarter, driven by growth in the U.S., U.K. and Japan as programmatic continues to burgeon. Unruly's consistent innovation in the ad distribution market and its provision of authenticated audiences make it particularly valuable at a time when advertisers are questioning value and veracity.
At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal's digital-only subscriber growth was 24% year-over-year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones, again, increased 10% as our publications served a growing public demand for a timely and reliable news. Total subscribers across Dow Jones recently passed its 3 million target based on preliminary internal metrics, and we expect continued growth in coming quarters.
Revenues at the Professional Information Business expanded 9%, led by the sterling performance of Risk and Compliance, with 45% year-over-year growth in its revenues. Reducing risk and ensuring compliance are clearly imperatives for our corporate clients.
While advertising declined overall, it did so at a slower rate compared to Q2, driven by low teens digital ad growth. The New York Post had strong advertising and audience numbers with 87 million uniques in March, a 72% year-over-year spike. In Australia, we made progress in reviewing our regional papers and continue to focus on core metro titles and The Australian, streamlining the business and improving operating efficiencies. Digital paid subscribers in News Corp Australian grew 23% and we also saw robust digital ad revenue growth.
One final note for the News and Information Services segment. Taken together, our premium publications, The Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian, experienced an average growth in digital subscriptions for Q3 of more than 20%, a testament to the success of the digital transformation of these mastheads.
In Book Publishing, we experienced a strong quarter with robust revenue and profitability at HarperCollins. This success was driven in part by best-selling U.S. titles such as A.J. Finn's The Woman In The Window, the only debut work of fiction in the past 12 years to immediately reach #1, and the continuing strength of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. 
Notably, our Christian publishing arm performed well with one of the year's best-performing titles, Kathie Lee Gifford's The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi, and renewed interest in the works of Billy Graham. Brain Murray's team continues to look for ways to leverage our global platform, including an important pact with best-selling author, Daniel Silva, acquiring the world rights to 6 more of his books starting with The Other Woman in July 2018.
We have finalized a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, underscoring the power of our back list. We expect to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as a result of this deal.
We're excited about the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, giving News Corp 65% of the business and our partners at Telstra of 35%. This agreement creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and comes at a time when over-the-top is becoming a significant part of our consumer portfolio. We believe Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, together, will provide consumers a compelling offering with incomparable programming and a tangibly improved user experience.
Cricket is core to Australian culture, and we have secured prime rights for 6 years with Cricket Australia. Fox Sports has plans to launch a dedicated cricket channel in the coming months to make the most of those rights. For the first time, fans will be able to watch the game without interruption where and when they want. 
Fox Sports will simulcast all cricket matches both in linear and digital formats, and will have valuable exclusivity for a number of crucial encounters. The cricket contract also means that we are now able to boast strong sports programming year-round, given our core NRL and IFL rights. And we are optimistic that our more complete sports offering will minimize churn. The coming year is, obviously, of vital importance and we expect the repositioning to be followed by a renaissance of the company.
In summary, we are pleased with the revenue growth we've seen across every segment of our business. We cherish the strength of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads, the vigor of our Digital Real Estate and global Book Publishing businesses and the promise of a significant transformation of News Corp with the consolidation of Foxtel in the current quarter. The character of our company will be enhanced and our reported revenue and EBITDA will be boosted significantly. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."
212741644,559963478,1460728,"News Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBI",2026,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year, with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $182 million, down from $215 million in the prior year.
For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.94 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The loss was primarily driven by the pretax noncash write-downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, as we communicated in March, and impairments related to News America Marketing which totaled $165 million.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes those and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we closed the Foxtel transaction at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and those results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during quarter 4, which I'll discuss in a few moments.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenue for the quarter were $1.3 billion, up 2% versus the prior year, a slightly improved rate over the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed $50 million this quarter to revenue.
Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 3%, and circulation and subscription revenues increased 7%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 3% and circulation and subscription revenues by 5%. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%, News UK rose 10%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 5%. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.
News and Information segment EBITDA this quarter was $85 million, down 31% versus the prior year. You may also recall that last year's results included a $12 million benefit related to an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly. We also had higher expenses this quarter at News UK, much of which was timing related.
There are also a few highlights that I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from strong growth in The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 24% year-over-year and up 7%, or 101,000, versus our fiscal second quarter. 
Pleasingly, we also saw an increase in subscriber ARPU at Dow Jones. In addition, we again saw strong year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times up 24% and at News Australia up 23%. At Dow Jones, we saw further revenue acceleration in the professional information business, which contributes to over 1/4 of the Dow Jones revenues. This past quarter, the Professional Information Business posted 9% revenue growth, led by Risk and Compliance, which grew 45%, and is on pace to exceed $100 million in total sales this year.
Advertising continues to be mixed across our news portfolio, but overall showed slightly better performance than last quarter. The U.K. was again a solid performer with advertising up 16% versus the prior year, or 3% in local currency, similar to its Q2 performance, led by digital advertising growth and moderating print advertising declines, particularly at The Sun. News Australia advertising declined 5% versus the prior year, or 9% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the second quarter rate.
Dow Jones advertising was down low double digits, improving on the trend from the second quarter, led by a strong performance in digital advertising. The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million, which represented about half of the decline this quarter.
Our cost initiatives are being centered around Australia, given the reliance on print advertising in that market. We have already significantly exceeded last year's AUD 40 million in cost savings during the first 9 months of the year, and continue to look for additional efficiencies. We are also continuing to review our portfolio in Australia as we focus on improving our profitability. And globally, as we have done in the U.K., we are in discussions with industry participants about potentially sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies.
Finally, at News America Marketing, overall results were lower but saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter benefiting from one additional insert and higher digital growth, as we expected and communicated on the last earnings call.
Turning to our publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter led by strong front list and back list performances. Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $398 million and segment EBITDA increased 16% to $43 million. Total results from general books and Christian publishing drove overall performance this quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, this quarter benefited from the continued performance of The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn and strong performances from the back list. Overall, the back list contributed approximately 58% of revenues in the quarter, up from 52% last year, helping to drive higher margin.
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5% and represented 22% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year, due to the strength in the downloadable audiobooks which now comprises 25% of digital revenue. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 27% to $279 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 17% to $88 million. REA Group revenues grew 35% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. 
While listing volumes were down modestly, partly due to an early Easter, we saw relatively stable trends in both Melbourne and Sydney. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose 15% to $115 million versus the prior year driven by strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher customer flow and higher yield. While core real estate revenues grew at a notably higher rate than the base growth rate, we saw slower growth in non-listing advertising revenues this quarter as part of a plan to test reducing advertising loads in select markets to drive engagement and lead volume, with early results encouraging.
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 61 million for the quarter, rising 10% versus the prior year, and reached 65 million in April. Move's operating expenses were higher this quarter, driven by planned incremental marketing to drive revenue growth and partly to increased traction in New York. We are also rebranding our core fleet of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the next few months.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $7 million, or 6%, to $129 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $16 million from $34 million in the prior year, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization and higher programming costs related to the NRL, which led to approximately $22 million higher costs this quarter. 
We also incurred approximately $2 million of expenditure related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The bulk of the transaction costs will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses of affiliates of $974 million reflects the $957 million noncash write-down of the carrying value of Foxtel in the quarter, as we had previously disclosed in March. This compares with negative $23 million in the prior year period. 
Foxtel revenues for the third quarter declined 1% to $587 million, and EBITDA decreased 21% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $80 million, primarily related to The Australian Football League rights and carriage fees for Fox Sports Australia as well as lower revenues.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of March 31, up nearly 1% versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, which were offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of T-Box subscribers, as part of the planned wind-down in the quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn were 15.4%, down from 16.1% and ARPU was down 1%. 
In early April, we completed the transaction with Telstra to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company, in which News Corp now owns 65%. The Foxtel results would be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during the fourth quarter, and it will also include approximately $1.7 billion of debt. 
As a consequence of the transaction, there will be some initial reinvestment required to improve the earnings and subscriber trajectory. To that end, one big step, as Robert highlighted, was securing long-term domestic Cricket rights, which will now materially improve Fox Sports with some offering, focusing on both subscriber volume and churn.
On the core broadcast business, our goal will be to maintain the subscriber base and manage churn effectively. We are progressing with the rollout of iQ3, which is showing promising signs on churn reduction and ARPU lift, and today has been deployed to approximately 1/4 of our broadcast base. We expect to continue to expand penetration of new set-top boxes and also to develop a next-generation box with enhanced customer features. 
Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative. This past fiscal year, our product development was focused on launching an IT version of our broadcast offering, which has helped to extend our reach and capture more of the affordable segments. Our goal in fiscal '19 is to launch new sports and non-sports products built on an IP-only platform targeted at specific demographics. 
With new management in the business, we are reviewing the cost base looking across content and operations to deliver further efficiencies and to ensure the business is rightsized to deliver the new initiatives.
Looking to the fourth quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, advertising trends, so far, appear broadly in line with the third quarter. However, we do expect slightly higher marketing costs in the fourth quarter at Dow Jones, mostly related to driving higher digital paid subscriber growth.
At Fox Sports and Foxtel, we will consolidate Foxtel in the fourth quarter, which will be reflected in newly formed segment called [ Subscription Video Services ], which will also include the Australian News Channel operator, Sky News. Overall, we expect subscriber trends at Foxtel to be relatively similar to the prior quarter, but do expect some additional OTT investment.
Results in the segment are also expected to include transaction costs in the $10 million to $15 million range. In Book Publishing, we expect to realize over $20 million in additional revenues in the fourth quarter from the agreement with Amazon to license The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien for a TV series. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, which should show some improvement in listing volumes, helped by the absence of Easter. And like the third quarter, we anticipate higher investment spending at Move to drive traffic and support new products.
While we're in the process of completing our purchase price allocation of Foxtel and evaluating the related impact from the profit and loss, there are a few items below the line worth mentioning regarding the Foxtel consolidation. 
Foxtel standalone depreciation and amortization for the first 9 months totaled $187 million, including $69 million for the quarter. In addition, we have also amortized an additional $49 million and $17 million for the first 9 months of the quarter and the quarter, respectively, related to the excess cost of our 50% share of the business that we acquired by the CMH acquisition in 2012. 
Foxtel results will be removed from the equity income and the 35% stake Telstra owns at the combined company will be reflected in minority interest going forward. We will also consolidate Foxtel's interest expense, which will reflect the $1.7 billion in debt that we will include on our balance sheet.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And there's much discussion at the moment about the general health of the housing market in the U.S., so listing volumes down about 7.2% year-on-year at present. But when you look at the broader trends in the U.S. economy, we're clearly going through a phase -- at least I would argue, en route to significantly more liquidity. The March seasonally adjusted annualized figures for sales are around $5.6 million. The median sales price was up 5.8% to around $250,400. And significantly, the number of homes in the U.S. seriously underwater, in Q2 2012, that was 28.6% of U.S. homes seriously underwater. That's down to 9.5% of homes. And given the issue at the market, at the moment, is not a problem of demand but a problem with supply and a compounding factor in the past has been a lack of job security. What -- with the strengthening of the U.S. job market, you'll see more people more confident about moving homes to a better job. Job mobility means mobility -- mobility means people moving and that will be good for business."

One in which premium content was actually diminished in stature by the very fact that, in Google Search, as you weren't basically able to find it. That has changed and we applaud that measure by Google. But as I mentioned, that's really step 1 on the pathway to provenance.

And one, cost of that summer lull has been significant churn, and with churn comes cost. So I think we are very confident that the team will put together a compelling summer package that will make Foxtel a year-round experience. It's a little early for us to give you details, meaningful details about the level of investment in the coming year. But as Susan mentioned, we will be focusing on the development of OTT and frankly, addressing issues that in the past have been problematic at Foxtel around the user interface. We want a user interface that's not in your face. And there's a real opportunity given the new structure at Foxtel, a clearer management lines and the new team under the leadership of Patrick Delany, to take advantage of what is a peerless portfolio of sports and entertainment rights."

And we're also looking to improve the customer service, obviously, in order to get more customers in. We've also mentioned that we're looking to expand the OTT propositions, and we want to look at sport as well as non-sports genres, but we also are rightsizing the cost base. So there's been a lot of cost work actually done today, so even before the merger happened. And the team down there is still heavily focused on looking at getting costs out so they go and set up with the reinvestment that we're looking at. So there's going to be lots of activity, obviously, that's going to happen going forward, but you're always in the quest to drive subscribers at a higher value going forward."

These are certainly uncertain times for some media companies, including social media companies. So it is quite significant that during fiscal 2018, News Corp grew revenues and total segment EBITDA and was an influential voice of reason and reform in the sector that is evolving, but remains indeed a profound change. When the New News Corp was launched 5 years ago, we promised to be relentlessly digital and global and that we would remain faithful to the principles and values inherited from the founding company. 
It was also crucial for our shareholders that we become more than some of our parts. And while we ardently believe there's much to look ahead, we are confident that closer integration between and among our companies is helping us realize that potential. Our News Masters and Digital property sites continue to work closely to drive valuable audience and traffic. And while our higher-quality journalism is crucial to the burgeoning of Storyful and to the exponential expansion of Mansion Global. 
These are not just contrive concepts but measurable outcomes and our full year numbers provide hard evidence of the company successful evolution. This past year, as a result of the transformative combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and muscular performance of the Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services, the News Corp crossed $1 billion threshold in profitability. And for the fourth quarter, both revenues and EBITDA were distantly higher compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, constructive conversations are underway with Google, YouTube and Facebook to recognize providence, contract, privacy and share the permission data that was generated by our journalism and our creative work. We sense that these companies are conscious that the editorial ecosystem is changing and that IP is a priority, while piracy and pedantry are anathema to the growth of a healthy and harmonious community. We are watching closely as Amazon, a dominant horizontal platform, expands into more verticals, beginning the possibility of polymeric abuse. We are reassured that the dominant algorithms are under increasingly close scrutiny, international. Thankfully, the credulous have been succeeded by the settlers. 1 important development reflected in the most recent quarters is the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We now control the combined company. And with the inherent structure and a new leadership in place, the combined business, obviously, increases the share of subscription revenues. At the time of our separation, almost half of News Corp revenue came from advertising. Today's, our revenues from advertising for the year accounted for less than a third of the half. In fact, this quarter, subscription and other non-advertising revenues now exceeded 70%, giving News Corp the foundation for growth in an age in which subscription is increasingly important, the revenues and for a deeper relationship with customers. The new Foxtel will also work much more closely with our markets, which we expect to be come an important marketing that form for subscriber growth. I was in Australia in recent days, and it's patent that there is an renewed vigor, creativity and customer consciousness at the company. We have traditionally suffered from poor city of some sports offerings, but the securing of rights from cricket Australia for 6 years and the launch of a dedicated ticket channel, mean that we will have a year around offering for the first time and believe that seasonal customer churn will decline. Our masters will certainly pay a crucial role in complement in our broadcast platform in the pursuit cricket victory. At Foxtel, we are confident that current sales of investment in rights and technology should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investors. 
The new team is acutely aware of the importance of improving the user interface and customer service and the need to innovate. Such as the introduction of an over-the-top streaming service, later this year, to give more Australian easier access to premium sports. We indicated our plans with IPL when we announced the combining of Foxtel and Foxtel Australia and that continues to be our goal. In News and Information Services, we were able to offset print advertising declines through our expanding digital revenues. We have seen notable success in subscriber growth at Dow Jones, which crossed the 3 million subscriber mark in June, with digital, accounting for 60% of the Wall Street journal subscribers. Also, at The Australian and The Times and The Sunday Times, digital subscribers are now more than half of the total subscriber base. Notably, at The Times and Sunday Times, we surpassed 500,000 total subscribers in June. Meanwhile, according to ComScore, in May, Sun Online topped Male Online in the U.K. in unique visitors. It is no coincidence that such growth in leadership comes alongside independent research, highlighting the trustworthiness of the Times of London and the Wall Street Journal. In an era in which veracity is a particular virtue and hyperbaly is no longer hip, we are proud to have the most trusted news brands around the world. 
These brands offer increasingly important venues for advertisers who want their reputation furnished, not tarnished. These thus, unsurprising that The Sun and The Times grew there full year ad revenues for the first time in 7 years. Wireless Group saw another set of audience figures this quarter. With the listening hours acute stations up [ 14% ] versus the prior year based on the latest industry data, outpacing the overall market. And revenues in the most recent quarter rose significantly. Thanks, in part, to England success at the World Cup but also because of the marketing progress of our U.K. and digital platforms. At Dow Jones, fiscal year circulation revenues grew 10%, largely due to digital subscriber growth at Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, there was a solid 7% increase in full year revenues at the professional information business, which is the largest year-on-year jump in their annual revenues since the creation of the new news. There was a particularly pleasing performance in Risk and Compliance as companies recognize the importance of Dow Jones inside the intelligence in areas crucial to the health of the business. And Dow Jones team is also working closely with the team at Storyfulis. It's unique understanding of social media around the world is crucial for company seeking to avoid reputational roadkill. The New York Post is gathering momentum in a tough tabloid market and is standup performer in greater New York, where its positive influence is matched by a positive audience response. The post digital network, including basics.com had 101 million unique visitors in June, up 51% on the previous year. 
Clearly, that growth is far superior to that of the New York Times and the struggling Daily News. The Wall Street Journal also added more digital subscribers and had significantly higher circulation revenue growth this quarter than the New York Times. In Australia, digital subscriber growth continue to pace. While our team address the cost base to stabilize and strengthen the business. The results of that vigilance reflected in a positive segment EBITDA contribution for the year and a platform for future growth. Cost savings and potential partnerships with traditional rivals around the world, such as Fairfax and Australia and Patro publish in the U.K. have become possible as the media landscape has changed dramatically. But we will never enter into agreements that undermine the essential character of commercial purpose and social role of their publications, as for Book Publishing. Our team at HarperCollins, through their expert discovery of great orders and apathetic curating of manuscripts and clever marketing campaigns, insured strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That success was reflected in the popularity with franchise titles and the effective leveraging of its substantial backlist. On benefit of that backlist was a $28 million in revenues coming from the sublicensing deals involving JRR tokens works. As Gandolf observed, perhaps with Chief Executive and Investors were most in mind, all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. Proper Collins also saw a continued growth in its digital revenues, thanks to the rising popularity of downloadable audio books. And we had substantial success in financial '18 with the strong sales and the best-selling, the Subtle Art Of Not Giving a Expletive, and from Joanne Magnolias Table, which, according to book scan, is a fastest-selling U.S. good book in history. In children's books, we had particular success with the actual group, which you'll see in the theaters later this year as a film from 20th century Fox. Now we come to our fastest-growing segment, Digital Real Estate Services, which is been a particular priority since the formation of the new news. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues rose 22% and segment EBITDA rose 24% for the year. We have become the most Global Digital Property company, and we certainly still have the potential for rapid growth without alienating realtors by becoming hot to trot house withers. At move, realtor.com core real estate revenues for fiscal '18 grew 20% with total revenues up by healthy 15% for the year. realtor.com continued to show strong audience games and maintain its lead -- tangible lead with 1.5x higher engagement compared to its nearest competitor. We are continuously working to improve returns for realtors and enhance experience for customers. It is worth noting that realtor.com has nearly doubled its revenue since the acquisition by News Corp less than 4 years ago. We believe that our largest investment, since the split, which has been both lucrative and transforming, is undervalued by Wall Street, given realtor.com significant revenue expansion, impressive increase in audience and the value of its peers in the Digital Real Estate sector. We remain committed to users of this site who are making an important investment for their families and to realtors, whom we have no intention of serving unlike certain other companies. Meanwhile, in Australia, REA continued to be an industry leader in both audience and innovation. Expanding into adjacencies like the mortgage brokerage business, which has quickly gained traction with 350,000 self-completed financial profiles as of June 30. At the close of this fiscal year, 5 years since our rebirth as company, we are proud to have leaders and creators so strong, passionate and purposeful, and number so self evidently robust, and a future that holds much promise for growth in audience, revenue and profit. Behind the impressive results, are the people of News Corp. We say our readers, members, and audiences and advertisers, all have contributed over success this year, and over the past 5 years. And have laid the foundation for a particularly prosperous and future for our investors. With that, I will turn the microphone over to Susan Panuccio."

But it before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 things from this past year-end and the quarter where have made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize news Information Services segment. And this showed tangible improvement through a combination of cost initiatives and digital investments. We are seeing strong digital paid subscriber growth across many of our key properties where digital subscribers now exceed print. Revenue was stable for the quarter and the fiscal year and a segment EBITDA reflected moderation decline and material improvement from recent trends. In addition, we continue to focus on potential industry solutions, which include our recently announced printing agreement for Fairfax in Australia. When we are focused on strengthening Real Estate Services Platform this year, which we have done by expanding into relevant adjacencies, investing in new businesses and products and growing our core audiences. This segment was our biggest EBITDA contributor and annual revenues now exceed well over $1 billion and have more than cyclical separation. The performance at our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting record revenue since a company separation. We completed the Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia combination which gives operational control to News Corp, reshapes our revenue base and provides more flexibility from News Corp, moving forward. And we continually to actively look at our portfolio. This year, we sold several non-core investments, including our technician and Mexican Australian continue to evaluate our options with respect to our regional community newspapers in Australia. With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full year fiscal 2018, total revenues of over $9 billion and 11% increase compared to prior year. This includes a consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestments and currency fluctuations, as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 2%. Reported total segment EBITDA for year was nearly $1.1 billion compared to $885 million in the prior year, a 21% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items that disclosed in the press release rose 6%. During the full year, we had several nonrecurring items impacting EPS. Those items included pretax noncash write-downs of $1.2 billion, primarily related to Foxtel Fox Sports Australia and News America Marketing, which we reported in the third quarter. And a [ $237 ] million charge, reflecting certain onetime adjustments as a consequence of the U.S. Tax Act. Finally, the fourth quarter included a loss of $337 million related to the Foxtel transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement and the result of the transaction, which is reflected on to other matters. Reported EPS from continuing operations were negative $2.60 compared to negative $1.27 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year. And now to the quarterly financial data. We reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 29% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 5%. Reported total segment EBITDA was $312 million compared to $215 million in the prior year, adjusted segment EBITDA, which excludes the Foxtel impact, rose 13%. For the quarter, reported EPS were negative $0.64 compared to negative $0.74 a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.08 versus $0.11 in the prior year. Turning now to the individual operation segment. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $143 billion and rose 1% versus the prior year. Within the segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 2% and circulation subscription revenues increased 5%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 1% and circulation and subscription revenues by 2%. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News U.K. rose 4% News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 2%. User Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $94 million, down 9% versus the prior year, which is a notable improvement on the decline we have experienced in the third quarter. There are a few highlights, which I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw strong digital subscriber growth across avenues businesses. At Dow Jones, calculation revenues grew 9% at the Wall Street Journal they grew 10% benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriber, which were up 35% year-over-year and up 7% versus our fiscal third quarter. In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 27% and also, at News Australia, up 14%. The professional information in business at Dow Jones posted 6% revenue growth, led again by Risk and Compliance which grew 35% in the quarter versus the prior year, and as expected exceeded $100 million in total sales this year. We remain very encouraged by the path and trajectory of growth. Just to fantasize, our key product in fiscal 2018 generated 27% of Dow Jones revenue. 
Fourth quarter at the advertising trends across avenues portfolio increased modestly from the fiscal third quarter rate. The U.K. was again a solid performer, with advertising up 6% versus the prior year of flattened local currency, led by digital advertising growth and higher year-on-year performances of both The Sun and The Times. News Australia advertising decline 6% versus the prior year and reported in local currency, showing further moderation advertising decline. Dow Jones advertising was down 10%, also affecting an improvement in printed lines at the Wall Street Journal. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print editions in Q2 impacted Dow Jones advertising revenue by $5 million, accounted for nearly half of the advertising decline in the quarter. We remain very focused on cost initiatives particularly in News Australia. While much work is still to be done, pleasingly News Australia showed some stability and profitability held by ongoing cost initiatives, which have exceeded our initial expectations and also high digital revenue. As we mentioned last quarter, we've been working with industry participants that potentially shaping or sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operation efficiencies across our key markets. News Corp Australia entered into a commericial printing arrangement with FX media to provide printing services in New South Wales and Queensland. We expect to realize approximately AUD 10 million of cost savings on an annualized basis from this agreement and continue to explore other opportunities to increase efficiencies. Finally, at News America marketing, revenues was relatively stable as weakness inset products were mostly off set by mid-single digit growth in installed advertising products. Profit contribution improved due to effective cost management. Turning to other Book Publishing segment. We posted very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backwards performances, combined with the contribution from the previously announced sublicensees agreement of Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings trilogy with Amazon. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 20% to $490 million and segment EBITDA increased 82% to $71 million. The Tolkien agreement, which highlights the value of intellectual property impacted revenue by $28 million or 7%. This quarter also benefited from several successfully news releases include Magnolia Table by Jaoanna Gains, or The Dark by Michelle MaCamara and Bill, Watch Your Face by Richard Hollis as well as the continued strength of backlist titles such as the Subtle Art by Mark Manson. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 49% of consumer revenue in the quarter, down 54% last year. While revenue this quarter were driven by success of the frontlist, backwards revenue still grew at a healthy rate on absolute basis. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, the highest growth in recent periods due to the strength of the downloadable audiobooks and represented 20% of consumer revenue in line with the prior year. In and the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 19% to $299 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 14% to $99 million. REA group revenue grew 27% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for premier and increase yield. The integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. Revenue growth was partially offset by low listing volumes. As always, please refer to REA earnings release and a conference call which will commence shortly after the call for additional details. News revenues rose 11% to $120 million versus the prior-year, driven by continued success in Connections for Buyers product. Connections for Buyers benefited from higher customer flow on yield as well as increased lead volume albeit a slower pace in the prior year. Category listed revenues which includes listing and lean base products grew 17%. As I mentioned last quarter, we've been rinsing of non-Listing advertising loads or part of the site redesign initially within slide markets improve engagement and lead volume with encouraging nearly sign. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com approximately [ $63 ] million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year. As expected, news expensive for higher this quarter due to planned, our aunt marketing and traffic acquisition cost to drive revenue growth and partly to increase our attraction in New York City. We're also rebranding upper core region professional services and to that of the commercial launch in the coming months. Turning to Subscription Video Services, which includes the newly combined Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia businesses and Sky News. You will see that we've attached a press release the pro forma statements for the past [ few ] years. Revenue were $610 million versus $140 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, last year's revenues were $643 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $97 million versus $24 million the prior year. As I alluded to last quarter, reported results for the segment include onetime transaction cost of $12 million. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined to $109 million from $178 million in the prior year, primarily due to the revenue impact on our just noted higher programming costs which reflect increased NRL and SSRI cost as well as $10 million of transition costs. On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribes arose 2.8 million as of June 30, nearly 2% versus the prior year and prior quarter, driven by Foxtel now subscription, offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of the line down of the T-Box and Foxtel subscribers. In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite residential tones 12.5%, down from 13.3% and ARPU was down 3% to AUD 80 per month. In the segment, subscription revenue totaled $523 million for the quarter accounted for 85% of segment revenue. The preachers revenue were down 4%, year-on-year, on a pro forma basis, resulting from the subscriber. At that time revenue totaled $67 million for the quarter accounted for over 10% of segment revenues. Advertising were down 12% year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to lower advertising at the Foxtel network channel. As I mentioned last quarter, there'll be some short-term reinvestment required at Foxtel to drive volume and improve the subscriber growth trajectory. I will briefly describe what these are. Firstly, beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we will start to incur the cost associated with the recently acquired Cricket Australia rights. We also face the full year NRL cost related to the step-up from the new rights contract which will likely be in the region of AUD 20 million or USD 15 million. Secondly, we anticipate the launch of an IP-only sports offering in the second quarter and are also actively considering other non-sports IP-only products targeted at specific demographic. Thirdly, the incremental depreciation and amortization as a consequence of the consolidation was approximately $75 million in the quarter. Finally, our full year results include approximately $60 million of capital related to the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, Foxtel CapEx was approximately $285 million. At this point, we expect Foxtel's fiscal 2019 CapEx to increase by at least [ $50 ] million to reflect expenditures related to higher penetration of next-generation set-top boxes including faulty upgrade and some additional project spend relating to improving its IP platform. These important to note that significant amount of Foxtel CapEx subscriber related, which include set-top boxes and capitalize installation cost and will be driven by sin volunteered as Robert mentioned, our goal continues to be driving to what an IPO and believe that improving subscription volumes will be key to our long-term value creation. Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative and our goal will be to maintain the broker subscriber base in many effectively. Finally, I would like to mention a few other things as we entered into fiscal 2019. At News and Information Services, while print advertising trends continue downward to have been relatively stable but visibility remains limited. As a consequence, we're very focused on driving higher penetration of digital paid subscriptions, rolling out new digital advertising solutions and delivering ongoing cost initiative particularly in Astoria and it sounded the segment achieved some stability this year and we remain focused on continued improvement. At Subscription Video Services, the expect to reinvestment if there is a mention focusing on launching new OTT products fork the next generation of the IQ box and managing our valuable broadcast space. And Book Publishing, overall, we're very pleased with the performance half Collins and applying trends seem relatively stable and we remain focused on expanding our foreign-language penetration. We will cycle from challenging comparisons in the coming year but we're excited about our new releases including the recent release of Daniel Feels, The Other Woman, and the November release of Homebody by Jaonna gains. At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued revenue growth at both REA and move into the segment to continue to play an important role in our revenue and EBITDA mix. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

These are certainly uncertain times for some media companies, including social media companies. So it is quite significant that during fiscal 2018, News Corp grew revenues and total segment EBITDA and was an influential voice of reason and reform in a sector that is evolving but remains in need of profound change. When the new News Corp was launched 5 years ago, we promised to be relentlessly digital and global and that we would remain faithful to the principles and the values inherited from the founding company. It was also crucial for our shareholders that we become more than the sum of our parts. And while we ardently believe there is much toil ahead, we are confident that closer integration between and among our companies is helping us realize that potential. 
Our news mastheads and digital property sites continue to work closely to drive valuable audience and traffic. And while our higher-quality journalism is crucial to the burgeoning of Storyful and to the exponential expansion of Mansion Global. 
These are not just contrived concepts but measurable outcomes, and our full year numbers provide hard evidence of the company's successful evolution. This past year, as a result of the transformative combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and muscular performances of Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services, the new News Corp crossed the $1 billion threshold in profitability. And for the fourth quarter, both revenues and EBITDA were distinctly higher compared to the previous year. 
Meanwhile, constructive conversations are underway with Google, YouTube and Facebook to recognize prominence, contract, piracy and share the permission data that was generated by our journalism and our creative work. We sense that these companies are conscious that the editorial ecosystem is changing and that IP is a priority, while piracy and pedantry are anathema to the growth of a healthy and harmonious community. We are watching closely as Amazon, a dominant horizontal platform, expands into more verticals, bringing the possibility of algorithmic abuse. We are reassured that the dominant algorithms are under increasingly close scrutiny internationally. Thankfully, the credulous have been succeeded by the sedulous. 
One important development reflected in the most recent quarter is the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We now control the combined company. And with the enhanced structure and a new leadership team in place, the combined business, obviously, increases the share of subscription revenues. 
At the time of our separation, almost half of News Corp revenue came from advertising. Today, our revenues from advertising for the year accounted for less than 1/3 of the whole. In fact, this quarter, subscription and other nonadvertising revenues now exceeded 70%, giving News Corp a healthy foundation for growth in an age in which subscription is increasingly important for revenues and for a deeper relationship with customers. 
The new Foxtel will also work much more closely with our mastheads, which we expect to become an important marketing platform for subscriber growth. I was in Australia in recent days, and it's patent that there is an renewed vigor, creativity and customer consciousness at the company. 
We have traditionally suffered from a paucity of summer sports offerings, but the securing of rights from Cricket Australia for 6 years and the launch of a dedicated cricket channel mean that we will have a year-round offering for the first time and believe that seasonal customer churn will decline. Our mastheads will certainly play a crucial role in complementing our broadcast platform in the pursuit of cricket victories. 
For Foxtel, we are confident that the current phase of investment in rights and technology should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investors. The new team is acutely aware of the importance of improving the user interface and customer service and the need to innovate, such as the introduction of an over-the-top streaming service later this year to give more Australian easier access to premium sports. 
We indicated our plans for an IPO when we announced the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and that continues to be our goal. 
In News and Information Services, we were able to offset print advertising declines through our expanding digital revenues. We have seen notable success in subscriber growth at Dow Jones, which crossed the 3 million subscriber mark in June, with digital accounting for 60% of the Wall Street Journal subscribers. Also, at The Australian and The Times and The Sunday Times, digital subscribers are now more than half of the total subscriber base. Notably, at The Times and Sunday Times, we surpassed 500,000 total subscribers in June. Meanwhile, according to ComScore, in May, Sun Online topped MaleOnline in the U.K. in unique visitors. It is no coincidence that such growth in readership comes alongside independent research, highlighting the trustworthiness of the Times of London and the Wall Street Journal. 
In an era in which veracity is a particular virtue and hyperbole is no longer hip, we are proud to have the most-trusted news brands around the world. These brands offer increasingly important venues for advertisers who want their reputation burnished, not tarnished. It is, thus, unsurprising that The Sun and The Times grew their full year ad revenues for the first time in 7 years. 
Wireless Group saw another set of audience figures this quarter, with the listening hours at our [indiscernible] station is up 14% versus the prior year based on the latest industry data, outpacing the overall market. And revenues in the most recent quarter rose significantly, thanks in part to England serendipitous success at the World Cup but also because of the marketing prowess of our U.K. and digital platforms. 
At Dow Jones, fiscal year circulation revenues grew 10%, largely due to digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, there was a solid 7% increase in full year revenues at the Professional Information Business, which is the largest year-on-year jump in their annual revenues since the creation of the new News. There was a particularly pleasing performance in Risk and Compliance as companies recognized the importance of Dow Jones' insight and the intelligence in areas crucial to the health of the business. 
Dow Jones' team is also working closely with the team at Storyful, whose unique understanding of social media around the world is crucial for companies seeking to avoid reputational roadkill. The New York Post is gathering momentum in a tough turbulent market and is a standup performer in greater New York, where its positive influence is matched by a positive audience response. The Post digital network, including pagesix.com, had 101 million unique visitors in June, up 51% on the previous year. Clearly, that growth is far superior to that of the New York Times and the struggling Daily News. The Wall Street Journal also added more digital subscribers and had significantly higher circulation revenue growth this quarter than the New York Times. 
In Australia, digital subscriber growth continue to pace, while our team addressed the cost base to stabilize and strengthen the business. The results of that vigilance were reflected in a positive segment EBITDA contribution for the year and a platform for future growth. Cost savings and potential partnerships with traditional rivals around the world, such as Fairfax in Australia and a plethora of publishers in the U.K., have become possible as the media landscape has changed dramatically. But we will never enter into agreements that undermine the essential character of commercial purpose and social role of their publications. 
As for Book Publishing, our team at HarperCollins, through their expert discovery of great orders and apathetic curating of manuscripts and clever marketing campaigns, ensured strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That success was reflected in the popularity of its frontlist titles and in the effective leveraging of its substantial backlist. One benefit of that backlist was the $28 million in revenues coming from the sublicensing deals involving J. R. R. Tolkien's works. As Gandalf observed, perhaps we're Chief Executives and investors almost in mind, ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.""
HarperCollins also saw continued growth in its digital revenues, thanks to the rising popularity of downloadable audio books. And we had substantial success in financial '18 with the strong sales of the best-selling The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Expletive, and from Joanne Gaines' Magnolia Table, which, according to BookScan, is the fastest-selling U.S. cookbook in history. 
In children's books, we had particular success with The Hate U Give, which you'll see in the theaters later this year as a film from 20th Century Fox. 
Now we come to our fastest-growing segment, Digital Real Estate Services, which has been a particular priority since the formation of the new News. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues rose 22% and segment EBITDA rose 24% for the year. We have become the most global digital property company, and we certainly still have the potential for rapid growth without alienating realtors by becoming hot to trot house-livers. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, core real estate revenues for fiscal '18 grew 20%, with total revenues up a healthy 15% for the year. realtor.com continued to show strong audience gains and maintained its lead -- tangible lead with 1.5x higher engagement compared to its nearest competitor. We are continuously working to improve returns for realtors and enhance experience for customers. It is worth noting that realtor.com has nearly doubled its revenues since the acquisition by News Corp less than 4 years ago. We believe that our largest investment since the split, which has been both lucrative and transforming, is undervalued by Wall Street, given realtor.com's significant revenue expansion, impressive increase in audience and the value of its peers in the digital real estate sector. We remain committed to users of this site, who are making an important investment for their families, and to realtors, whom we have no intention of usurping, unlike certain other companies. 
Meanwhile, in Australia, REA continued to be an industry leader in both audience and innovation, expanding into adjacencies like the mortgage broker business, which has quickly gained traction with 350,000 self-completed financial profiles as of June 30. 
At the close of this fiscal year, 5 years since our rebirth as a company, we are proud to have leaders and creators so strong, passionate and purposeful, and numbers so self-evidently robust and a future that holds much promise for growth in audience, revenue and profit. Behind the impressive results, are the people of News Corp, who serve our readers, members audiences and advertisers, all have contributed to our success this year and over the past 5 years, and have laid the foundations for a particularly prosperous and a fecund future for our investors. 
With that, I will turn the microphone over to Susan Panuccio."
212741644,574725142,1530062,"News Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year",2385,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year, showed tangible improvement through a combination of cost initiatives and digital investments. We are seeing strong digital paid subscriber growth across many of our key properties where digital subscribers now exceed print. Revenues were stable for the quarter and the fiscal year, and the segment EBITDA reflected moderation in declines, a material improvement from recent trends. In addition, we continue to focus on potential industry solutions, which include our recently announced printing agreement for Fairfax in Australia. 
We have focused on strengthening our Digital Real Estate Services platform this year, which we have done by expanding into relevant adjacencies, investing in new businesses and products and growing our core audiences. This segment was our biggest EBITDA contributor, and annual revenues now exceed well over $1 billion and have more than cyclical separation. 
The performance at our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting record revenues since the company separated. 
We completed the Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia combination, which gives operational control to News Corp, reshapes our revenue base and provides more flexibility for News Corp moving forward. 
And we continually to actively look at our portfolio. This year, we sold several noncore investments, including our stake in SEEK Asia and magazines in Australian and continue to evaluate our options with respect to our regional and community newspapers in [indiscernible]. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full year fiscal 2018, total revenues were over $9 billion, an 11% increase compared to prior year. This includes the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestments and currency fluctuations, as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 2%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was nearly $1.1 billion compared to $885 million in the prior year, a 21% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 6%. 
During the full year, we had several nonrecurring items impacting EPS. Those items included pretax noncash write-downs of $1.2 billion, primarily related to Foxtel/Fox Sports Australia and News America Marketing, which we reported in the third quarter, and a $237 million charge, reflecting certain onetime adjustments as a consequence of the U.S. Tax Act. 
Finally, the fourth quarter included a loss of $337 million related to the Foxtel transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement and the result of the transaction, which is reflected under other net. 
Reported EPS from continuing operations were negative $2.60 compared to negative $1.27 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year. 
And now to the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 29% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 5%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $312 million compared to $215 million in the prior year, adjusted segment EBITDA, which excludes the Foxtel impact, rose 13%. 
For the quarter, reported EPS were negative $0.64 compared to negative $0.74 a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.08 versus $0.11 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion and rose 1% versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 2% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 5%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 1% and circulation and subscription revenues by 2%. 
Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News U.K. rose 4%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 2%. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $94 million, down 9% versus the prior year, which is a notable improvement on the decline we experienced in the third quarter. 
There are a few highlights, which I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw strong digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 9% and at the Wall Street Journal they grew 10%, benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriber, which were up 25% year-over-year and up 7% versus our fiscal third quarter. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 27%; and also at News Australia, up 14%. 
The Professional Information Business, or PIB, at Dow Jones posted 6% revenue growth, led again by Risk and Compliance, which grew 35% in the quarter versus the prior year and, as expected, exceeded $100 million in total sales this year. We remain very encouraged by the path line and trajectory of growth. Just to frame the size, our PIB products in fiscal 2018 generated 27% of Dow Jones revenues. 
Fourth quarter advertising trends across our news portfolio improved modestly from the fiscal third quarter rate. The U.K. was again a solid performer, with advertising up 6% versus the prior year of flat in local currency, led by digital advertising growth and higher year-on-year performances of both The Sun and The Times. 
News Australia advertising declined 6% versus the prior year in reported and local currency, showing further moderation of print advertising declines. 
Dow Jones advertising was down 10%, also reflecting an improvement in print declines at the Wall Street Journal. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print editions in Q2 impacted Dow Jones advertising revenue by $5 million, accounting for nearly half of the advertising decline in this quarter. 
We remain very focused on cost initiatives, particularly at News Australia. While much work is still to be done, pleasingly, News Australia showed some stability and profitability, helped by ongoing cost initiatives, which have exceeded our initial expectations, and also high digital revenues. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we have been working with industry participants without potentially shaping or sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies across our key markets. News Corp Australia entered into a commercial printing arrangement with Fairfax Media to provide printing services in New South Wales and Queensland. We expect to realize approximately AUD 10 million of cost savings on an annualized basis from this agreement and continue to explore other opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were relatively stable as weakness in inset products were mostly offset by mid-single digit growth in in-store advertising products. Profit contribution improved due to effective cost management. 
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backwards performances, combined with the contribution from the previously announced sublicensing agreement of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 20% to $490 million, and segment EBITDA increased 82% to $71 million. The Tolkien agreement, which highlights the value of intellectual property, impacted revenues by $28 million or 7%. 
This quarter also benefited from several successfully new releases, including Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, as well as the continued strength of backlist titles, such as The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. 
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 49% of consumer revenues in the quarter, down 54% last year. While revenues this quarter were driven by the success of the frontlist, backlist revenues still grew at a healthy rate on an absolute basis. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, the highest growth in recent periods due to the strength of the downloadable audiobooks and represented 20% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 19% to $299 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 14% to $99 million. 
REA Group revenues grew 27% due to very strong residential debt-to-revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for premier [indiscernible] and increased yield, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. Revenue growth was partially offset by lower listing volumes. As always, please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details. 
Move revenues rose 11% to $120 million versus the prior year, driven by continued success of its Connections for Buyers product. Connections for Buyers benefited from higher customer flow and yield as well as increased lead volume, albeit at a slower pace than the prior year. 
[indiscernible] real estate revenues, which includes listing and lead-based products, grew 17%. As I mentioned last quarter, we have been reducing our non-listing advertising loads as part of the site redesign, initially within select markets to improve engagement and lead volume with encouraging nearly sign. 
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 63 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year. 
As expected, Move's expensive were higher this quarter due to planned brand marketing and traffic-acquisition costs to drive revenue growth and partly to increase our traction in New York City. 
We are also rebranding our core suite of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the coming months. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services, which includes the newly combined Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia businesses and Sky News. You will see that we have attached with the press release the pro forma statements for the past 2 years. Revenues were $610 million versus $140 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, last year's revenues were $643 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $97 million versus $24 million in the prior year. As I alluded to last quarter, reported results for the segment include onetime transaction cost of $12 million. 
On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined to $109 million from $178 million in the prior year, primarily due to the revenue impact I just noted; higher programming costs, which reflect increased NRL and SSI rights cost; as well as $10 million of transition costs. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribes were over 2.8 million as of June 30, up nearly 2% versus the prior year and prior quarter, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of the wind down of the T-Box and Optus subscribers. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite residential churn was 12.5%, down from the 13.3%, and ARPU was down 3% to AUD 80 per month. 
In the segment, subscription revenues totaled $523 million for the quarter, accounting for 85% of segment revenues. Subscription revenues were down 4% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, resulting from the subscriber mix. 
Advertising revenues totaled $67 million for the quarter, accounting for over 10% of segment revenues. Advertising was down 12% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily due to lower advertising at the Foxtel network channel. 
As I mentioned last quarter, there will be some short-term reinvestment required at Foxtel to drive volume and improve the subscriber trajectory. I will briefly describe what these are. Firstly, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we will start to incur the costs associated with the recently acquired Cricket Australia rights. We also face the full year of NRL costs related to the step-up from the new rights contract, which will likely be in the region of AUD 20 million or USD 15 million. 
Secondly, we anticipate the launch of an IP-only sports offering in the second quarter and are also actively considering other nonsports IP-only products targeted at specific demographics. 
Thirdly, the incremental depreciation and amortization as a consequence of the consolidation was approximately $75 million in the quarter. 
Finally, our full year results include approximately $60 million of CapEx related to the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, Foxtel CapEx was approximately $285 million. At this point, we expect Foxtel's fiscal 2019 CapEx to increase by at least $50 million to reflect expenditures related to higher penetration of next-generation set-top boxes, including 4k upgrade and some additional project spend relating to improving its IP platform. It is important to note that a significant amount of Foxtel's CapEx is subscriber related, which includes set-top boxes and capitalized installation costs and will be driven by sales volume.
As Robert mentioned, our goal continues to be driving towards an IPO and believe that improving subscription volumes will be key to our long-term value creation. Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative, and our goal will be to maintain the broadcast subscriber base and manage churn effectively. 
Finally, I would like to mention a few other themes as we enter into fiscal 2019. At News and Information Services, while print advertising trends continue downwards, they have been relatively stable, but visibility remains limited. As a consequence, we are very focused on driving higher penetration of digital paid subscriptions, rolling out new digital advertising solutions and delivering ongoing cost initiatives, particularly in Australia and at New U.K. The segment achieved some stability this year, and we remain focused on continued improvements. 
At Subscription Video Services, we expect reinvestments this year, as I mentioned, focusing on launching new OTT products, 4K, the next generation of the IQ box and managing our valuable broadcast space. 
In Book Publishing, overall, we are very pleased with the performance of HarperCollins. Underlying trends seem relatively stable, and we remain focused on expanding our foreign language penetration. We will cycle some challenging comparisons in the coming year, but we are excited about our new releases, including the recent release of Daniel Silva's The Other Woman and the November release of Homebody by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued revenue growth of both REA and Move and for the segment to continue to play an important role in our revenue and EBITDA mix. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And you would expect over coming quarters, though I'm not a Super Saiyan, that if the housing market picks up, you'll see a pickup also in core realtor revenues."

The second question, you're right. If you adjust for M&A and other matters then the costs were flat across News and Information Services. And I think it's fair to say we've probably got business at different growth rates and different parts of their cycles. So Dow Jones we'll probably see as more of an investment going forward. They have got revenue growth. Obviously, they had revenue growth this year. We're expecting to continue to invest in marketing and acquisition costs as they continue to push those digital subscribers. I think it will be fair to say that News Australia, we're balancing cost reinvestments with costs out. And we do believe that there's more work that can be done down there, and the team is very focused on that. And at News U.K., there is indeed still opportunities around costs out there. We'd expect those probably to be lesser than the ones that we would see in Australia as they continue to reinvest in their digital products over there. So I think it's a mixed bag across the group, but we certainly see more opportunities in front of us."

These are certainly uncertain times for some media companies, including social media companies. So it is quite significant that during fiscal 2018, News Corp grew revenues and total segment EBITDA and was an influential voice of reason and reform in a sector that is evolving but remains in need of profound change. When the new News Corp was launched 5 years ago, we promised to be relentlessly digital and global and that we would remain faithful to the principles and the values inherited from the founding company. It was also crucial for our shareholders that we become more than the sum of our parts. And while we ardently believe there is much toil ahead, we are confident that closer integration between and among our companies is helping us realize that potential. 
Our news mastheads and digital property sites continue to work closely to drive valuable audience and traffic. And while our higher-quality journalism is crucial to the burgeoning of Storyful and to the exponential expansion of Mansion Global. 
These are not just contrived concepts but measurable outcomes, and our full year numbers provide hard evidence of the company's successful evolution. This past year, as a result of the transformative combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and muscular performances of Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services, the new News Corp crossed the $1 billion threshold in profitability. And for the fourth quarter, both revenues and EBITDA were distinctly higher compared to the previous year. 
Meanwhile, constructive conversations are underway with Google, YouTube and Facebook to recognize providence, contract [Audio Gap], piracy and share the permission data that was generated by our journalism and our creative work. We sense that these companies are conscious that the editorial ecosystem is changing and that IP is a priority, while piracy and pedantry are anathema to the growth of a healthy and harmonious community. We are watching closely as Amazon, a dominant horizontal platform, expands into more verticals, bringing the possibility of algorithmic abuse. We are reassured that the dominant algorithms are under increasingly close scrutiny internationally. Thankfully, the credulous have been succeeded by the sedulous. 
One important development reflected in the most recent quarter is the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We now control the combined company. And with the enhanced structure and a new leadership team in place, the combined business, obviously, increases the share of subscription revenues. 
At the time of our separation, almost half of News Corp revenue came from advertising. Today, our revenues from advertising for the year accounted for less than 1/3 of the whole. In fact, this quarter, subscription and other nonadvertising revenues now exceeded 70%, giving News Corp a healthy foundation for growth in an age in which subscription is increasingly important for revenues and for a deeper relationship with customers. 
The new Foxtel will also work much more closely with our mastheads, which we expect to become an important marketing platform for subscriber growth. I was in Australia in recent days, and it's patent that there is an renewed vigor, creativity and customer consciousness at the company. 
We have traditionally suffered from a paucity of summer sports offerings, but the securing of rights from Cricket Australia for 6 years and the launch of a dedicated cricket channel mean that we will have a year-round offering for the first time and believe that seasonal customer churn will decline. Our mastheads will certainly play a crucial role in complementing our broadcast platform in the pursuit of cricket victories. 
For Foxtel, we are confident that the current phase of investment in rights and technology should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investors. The new team is acutely aware of the importance of improving the user interface and customer service and the need to innovate, such as the introduction of an over-the-top streaming service later this year to give more Australians easier access to premium sports. 
We indicated our plans for an IPO when we announced the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and that continues to be our goal. 
In News and Information Services, we were able to offset print advertising declines through our expanding digital revenues. We have seen notable success in subscriber growth at Dow Jones, which crossed the 3 million subscriber mark in June, with digital accounting for more than 60% of the Wall Street Journal subscribers. Also, at The Australian and The Times and The Sunday Times, digital subscribers are now more than half of the total subscriber base. Notably, at The Times and Sunday Times, we surpassed 500,000 total subscribers in June. Meanwhile, according to ComScore, in May, Sun Online topped MailOnline in the U.K. in unique visitors. It is no coincidence that such growth in readership comes alongside independent research, highlighting the trustworthiness of the Times of London and the Wall Street Journal. 
In an era in which veracity is a particular virtue and hyperbole is no longer hip, we are proud to have the most-trusted news brands around the world. These brands offer increasingly important venues for advertisers who want their reputation burnished, not tarnished. It is, thus, unsurprising that The Sun and The Times grew their full year ad revenues for the first time in 7 years. 
Wireless Group saw another strong set of audience figures this quarter, with the listening hours at our [indiscernible] stations up 14% versus the prior year based on the latest industry data, outpacing the overall market. And revenues in the most recent quarter rose significantly, thanks in part to England serendipitous success at the World Cup but also because of the marketing prowess of our U.K. and digital platforms. 
At Dow Jones, fiscal year circulation revenues grew 10%, largely due to digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, there was a solid 7% increase in full year revenues at the Professional Information Business, which is the largest year-on-year jump in their annual revenues since the creation of the new News. There was a particularly pleasing performance in Risk and Compliance as companies recognized the importance of Dow Jones' insight and intelligence in areas crucial to the health of the business. 
The Dow Jones' team is also working closely with the team at Storyful, whose unique understanding of social media around the world is crucial for companies seeking to avoid reputational roadkill. The New York Post is gathering momentum in a tough [ tabloidient ] market and is a standup performer in greater New York, where its positive influence is matched by a positive audience response. The Post digital network, including pagesix.com, had 101 million unique visitors in June, up 51% on the previous year. Clearly, that growth is far superior to that of the New York Times and the struggling Daily News. The Wall Street Journal also added more digital subscribers and had significantly higher circulation revenue growth this quarter than the New York Times. 
In Australia, digital subscriber growth continue to pace, while our team addressed the cost base to stabilize and strengthen the business. The results of that vigilance were reflected in a positive segment EBITDA contribution for the year and a platform for future growth. Cost savings and potential partnerships with traditional rivals around the world, such as Fairfax in Australia and a plethora of publishers in the U.K., have become possible as the media landscape has changed dramatically. But we will never enter into agreements that undermine the essential character of commercial purpose and social role of their publications. 
As for Book Publishing, our team at HarperCollins, through their expert discovery of great authors and empathetic curating of manuscripts and clever marketing campaigns, ensured strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That success was reflected in the popularity of its frontlist titles and in the effective leveraging of its substantial backlist. One benefit of that backlist was the $28 million in revenues coming from the sublicensing deals involving J.R.R. Tolkien's works. As Gandalf observed, perhaps with Chief Executives and investors foremost in mind, ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.""
HarperCollins also saw continued growth in its digital revenues, thanks to the rising popularity of downloadable audio books. And we had substantial success in financial '18 with the strong sales of the best-selling The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Expletive, and from Joanne Gaines' Magnolia Table, which, according to BookScan, is the fastest-selling U.S. cookbook in history. 
In children's books, we had particular success with The Hate U Give, which you'll see in the theaters later this year as a film from 20th Century Fox. 
Now we come to our fastest-growing segment, Digital Real Estate Services, which has been a particular priority since the formation of the new News. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues rose 22% and segment EBITDA rose 24% for the year. We have become the most global digital property company, and we certainly still have the potential for rapid growth without alienating realtors by becoming hot to trot house-flippers. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, core real estate revenues for fiscal '18 grew 20%, with total revenues up a healthy 15% for the year. realtor.com continued to show strong audience gains and maintained its lead -- tangible lead with 1.5x higher engagement compared to its nearest competitor. We are continuously working to improve returns for realtors and enhance experience for customers. It is worth noting that realtor.com has nearly doubled its revenues since the acquisition by News Corp less than 4 years ago. We believe that our largest investment since the split, which has been both lucrative and transforming, is undervalued by Wall Street, given realtor.com's significant revenue expansion, impressive increase in audience and the value of its peers in the digital real estate sector. We remain committed to users of this site, who are making an important investment for their families, and to realtors, whom we have no intention of usurping, unlike certain other companies. 
Meanwhile, in Australia, REA continued to be an industry leader in both audience and innovation, expanding into adjacencies like the mortgage broker business, which has quickly gained traction with 350,000 self-completed financial profiles as of June 30. 
At the close of this fiscal year, 5 years since our rebirth as a company, we are proud to have leaders and creators so strong, passionate and purposeful, and numbers so self-evidently robust and a future that holds much promise for growth in audience, revenue and profit. Behind the impressive results, are the people of News Corp, who serve our readers, members audiences and advertisers, all have contributed to our success this year and over the past 5 years, and have laid the foundations for a particularly prosperous and fecund future for our investors. 
With that, I will turn the microphone over to Susan Panuccio."

Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year",2390,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year, showed tangible improvement through a combination of cost initiatives and digital investments. We are seeing strong digital paid subscriber growth across many of our key properties where digital subscribers now exceed print. Revenues were stable for the quarter and the fiscal year, and the segment EBITDA reflected moderation in declines, a material improvement from recent trends. In addition, we continue to focus on potential industry solutions, which include our recently announced printing agreement for Fairfax in Australia. 
We have focused on strengthening our Digital Real Estate Services platform this year, which we have done by expanding into relevant adjacencies, investing in new businesses and products and growing our core audiences. This segment was our biggest EBITDA contributor, and annual revenues now exceed well over $1 billion and have more than tripled since separation. 
The performance at our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting record revenues since the company separated. 
We completed the Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia combination, which gives operational control to News Corp, reshapes our revenue base and provides more flexibility for News Corp moving forward. 
And we continue to actively look at our portfolio. This year, we sold several noncore investments, including our stake in SEEK Asia and magazines in Australian and continue to evaluate our options with respect to our regional and community newspapers in [indiscernible]. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full year fiscal 2018, total revenues were over $9 billion, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. This includes the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestments and currency fluctuations, as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 2%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was nearly $1.1 billion compared to $885 million in the prior year, a 21% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 6%. 
During the full year, we had several non-reoccurring items impacting EPS. Those items included pretax noncash write-downs of $1.2 billion, primarily related to Foxtel/Fox Sports Australia and News America Marketing, which we reported in the third quarter, and a $237 million charge, reflecting certain onetime adjustments as a consequence of the U.S. Tax Act. 
Finally, the fourth quarter included a loss of $337 million related to the Foxtel transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement and the result of the transaction, which is reflected under other net. 
Reported EPS from continuing operations were negative $2.60 compared to negative $1.27 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year. 
And now to the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 29% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 5%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $312 million compared to $215 million in the prior year, adjusted segment EBITDA, which excludes the Foxtel impact, rose 13%. 
For the quarter, reported EPS were negative $0.64 compared to negative $0.74 a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.08 versus $0.11 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion and rose 1% versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 2% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 5%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 1% and circulation and subscription revenues by 2%. 
Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News U.K. rose 4%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 2%. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $94 million, down 9% versus the prior year, which is a notable improvement on the declines we experienced in the third quarter. 
There are a few highlights, which I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw strong digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 9% and at the Wall Street Journal they grew 10%, benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 25% year-over-year and up 7% versus our fiscal third quarter. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 27%; and also at News Australia, up 14%. 
The Professional Information Business, or PIB, at Dow Jones posted 6% revenue growth, led again by Risk and Compliance, which grew 35% in the quarter versus the prior year and, as expected, exceeded $100 million in total sales this year. We remain very encouraged by the pipeline and trajectory of growth. Just to frame the size, our PIB products in fiscal 2018 generated 27% of Dow Jones revenues. 
Fourth quarter advertising trends across our news portfolio improved modestly from the fiscal third quarter rate. The U.K. was again a solid performer, with advertising up 6% versus the prior year or flat in local currency, led by digital advertising growth and higher year-on-year performances of both The Sun and The Times. 
News Australia advertising declined 6% versus the prior year in reported and local currency, showing further moderation of print advertising declines. 
Dow Jones advertising was down 10%, also reflecting an improvement in print declines at the Wall Street Journal. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print editions in Q2 impacted Dow Jones advertising revenue by $5 million, accounting for nearly half of the advertising decline in this quarter. 
We remain very focused on cost initiatives, particularly at News Australia. While much work is still to be done, pleasingly, News Australia showed some stability and profitability, helped by ongoing cost initiatives, which have exceeded our initial expectations, and also higher digital revenues. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we have been working with industry participants about potentially shaping or sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies across our key markets. News Corp Australia entered into a commercial printing arrangement with Fairfax Media to provide printing services in New South Wales and Queensland. We expect to realize approximately AUD 10 million of cost savings on an annualized basis from this agreement and continue to explore other opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were relatively stable as weakness in inset products were mostly offset by mid-single digit growth in in-store advertising products. Profit contribution improved due to effective cost management. 
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, combined with the contribution from the previously announced sublicensing agreement of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 20% to $490 million, and segment EBITDA increased 82% to $71 million. The Tolkien agreement, which highlights the value of intellectual property, impacted revenues by $28 million or 7%. 
This quarter also benefited from several successfully new releases, including Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, as well as the continued strength of backlist titles, such as The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. 
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 49% of consumer revenues in the quarter, down 54% from last year. While revenues this quarter were driven by the success of the frontlist, backlist revenues still grew at a healthy rate on an absolute basis. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, the highest growth in recent periods due to the strength of the downloadable audiobooks and represented 20% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 19% to $299 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 14% to $99 million. 
REA Group revenues grew 27% due to very strong residential debt-to-revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for premier [indiscernible] and increased yield, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. Revenue growth was partially offset by lower listing volumes. As always, please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details. 
Move revenues rose 11% to $120 million versus the prior year, driven by continued success of its Connections for Buyers product. Connections for Buyers benefited from higher customer flow and yield as well as increased lead volume, albeit at a slower pace than the prior year. 
[indiscernible] real estate revenues, which includes listing and lead-based products, grew 17%. As I mentioned last quarter, we have been reducing our non-listing advertising loads as part of the site redesign, initially within select markets to improve engagement and lead volume with encouraging nearly sign. 
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 63 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year. 
As expected, Move's expensive were higher this quarter due to planned brand marketing and traffic-acquisition costs to drive revenue growth and partly to increase our traction in New York City. 
We are also rebranding our core suite of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the coming months. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services, which includes the newly combined Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia businesses and Sky News. You will see that we have attached to the press release the pro forma statements for the past [ 2 ] years. Revenues were $610 million versus $140 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, last year's revenues were $643 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $97 million versus $24 million in the prior year. As I alluded to last quarter, reported results for the segment include onetime transaction cost of $12 million. 
On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined to $109 million from $178 million in the prior year, primarily due to the revenue impact I just noted; higher programming costs, which reflect increased NRL and SSI rights cost; as well as $10 million of transition costs. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribes were over 2.8 million as of June 30, up nearly 2% versus the prior year and prior quarter, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of the wind down of the T-Box and Optus subscribers. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite residential churn was 12.5%, down from the 13.3%, and ARPU was down 3% to AUD 80 per month. 
In the segment, subscription revenues totaled $523 million for the quarter, accounting for over 85% of segment revenues. Subscription revenues were down 4% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, resulting from the subscriber mix. 
Advertising revenues totaled $67 million for the quarter, accounting for over 10% of segment revenues. Advertising was down 12% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, primarily due to lower advertising at the Foxtel network channels. 
As I mentioned last quarter, there will be some short-term reinvestment required at Foxtel to drive volume and improve the subscriber trajectory. I will briefly describe what these are. Firstly, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we will start to incur the costs associated with the recently acquired Cricket Australia rights. We also face a full year of NRL costs related to the step-up from the new rights contract, which will likely be in the region of AUD 20 million or USD 15 million. 
Secondly, we anticipate the launch of an IP-only sports offering in the second quarter and are also actively considering other nonsports IP-only products targeted at specific demographics. 
Thirdly, the incremental depreciation and amortization as a consequence of the consolidation was approximately $75 million in the quarter. 
Finally, our full year results include approximately $60 million of CapEx related to the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, Foxtel CapEx was approximately $285 million. At this point, we expect Foxtel's fiscal 2019 CapEx to increase by at least $50 million to reflect expenditures related to higher penetration of next-generation set-top boxes, including 4K upgrade and some additional project spend relating to improving its IP platform. It is important to note that a significant amount of Foxtel's CapEx is subscriber related, which includes set-top boxes and capitalized installation costs and will be driven by sales volume.
As Robert mentioned, our goal continues to be driving towards an IPO and believe that improving subscription volumes will be key to our long-term value creation. Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative, and our goal will be to maintain the broadcast subscriber base and manage churn effectively. 
Finally, I would like to mention a few other themes as we enter into fiscal 2019. At News and Information Services, while print advertising trends continue downwards, they have been relatively stable, but visibility remains limited. As a consequence, we are very focused on driving higher penetration of digital paid subscriptions, rolling out new digital advertising solutions and delivering ongoing cost initiatives, particularly in Australia and at News UK. The segment achieved some stability this year, and we remain focused on continued improvements. 
At Subscription Video Services, we expect reinvestments this year, as I mentioned, focusing on launching new OTT products, 4K, the next generation of the IQ box and managing our valuable broadcast space. 
In Book Publishing, overall, we are very pleased with the performance of HarperCollins. Underlying trends seem relatively stable, and we remain focused on expanding our foreign language penetration. We will cycle some challenging comparisons in the coming year, but we are excited about our new releases, including the recent release of Daniel Silva's The Other Woman and a November release of Homebody by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued revenue growth of both REA and Move and for the segment to continue to play an important role in our revenue and EBITDA mix. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

These are certainly uncertain times for some media companies, including social media companies. So it is quite significant that during fiscal 2018, News Corp grew revenues and total segment EBITDA and was an influential voice of reason and reform in a sector that is evolving but remains in need of profound change. When the new News Corp was launched 5 years ago, we promised to be relentlessly digital and global and that we would remain faithful to the principles and the values inherited from the founding company. It was also crucial for our shareholders that we become more than the sum of our parts. And while we ardently believe there is much toil ahead, we are confident that closer integration between and among our companies is helping us realize that potential. 
Our news mastheads and digital property sites continue to work closely to drive valuable audience and traffic. And while our higher-quality journalism is crucial to the burgeoning of Storyful and to the exponential expansion of Mansion Global. 
These are not just contrived concepts but measurable outcomes, and our full year numbers provide hard evidence of the company's successful evolution. This past year, as a result of the transformative combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and muscular performances of Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services, the new News Corp crossed the $1 billion threshold in profitability. And for the fourth quarter, both revenues and EBITDA were distinctly higher compared to the previous year. 
Meanwhile, constructive conversations are underway with Google, YouTube and Facebook to recognize providence, contract [Audio Gap], piracy and share the permission data that was generated by our journalism and our creative work. We sense that these companies are conscious that the editorial ecosystem is changing and that IP is a priority, while piracy and pedantry are anathema to the growth of a healthy and harmonious community. We are watching closely as Amazon, a dominant horizontal platform, expands into more verticals, bringing the possibility of algorithmic abuse. We are reassured that the dominant algorithms are under increasingly close scrutiny internationally. Thankfully, the credulous have been succeeded by the sedulous. 
One important development reflected in the most recent quarter is the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We now control the combined company. And with the enhanced structure and a new leadership team in place, the combined business, obviously, increases the share of subscription revenues. 
At the time of our separation, almost half of News Corp revenue came from advertising. Today, our revenues from advertising for the year accounted for less than 1/3 of the whole. In fact, this quarter, subscription and other nonadvertising revenues now exceeded 70%, giving News Corp a healthy foundation for growth in an age in which subscription is increasingly important for revenues and for a deeper relationship with customers. 
The new Foxtel will also work much more closely with our mastheads, which we expect to become an important marketing platform for subscriber growth. I was in Australia in recent days, and it's patent that there is an renewed vigor, creativity and customer consciousness at the company. 
We have traditionally suffered from a paucity of summer sports offerings, but the securing of rights from Cricket Australia for 6 years and the launch of a dedicated cricket channel mean that we will have a year-round offering for the first time and believe that seasonal customer churn will decline. Our mastheads will certainly play a crucial role in complementing our broadcast platform in the pursuit of cricket victories. 
For Foxtel, we are confident that the current phase of investment in rights and technology should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investors. The new team is acutely aware of the importance of improving the user interface and customer service and the need to innovate, such as the introduction of an over-the-top streaming service later this year to give more Australians easier access to premium sports. 
We indicated our plans for an IPO when we announced the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and that continues to be our goal. 
In News and Information Services, we were able to offset print advertising declines through our expanding digital revenues. We have seen notable success in subscriber growth at Dow Jones, which crossed the 3 million subscriber mark in June, with digital accounting for more than 60% of the Wall Street Journal subscribers. Also, at The Australian and The Times and The Sunday Times, digital subscribers are now more than half of the total subscriber base. Notably, at The Times and Sunday Times, we surpassed 500,000 total subscribers in June. Meanwhile, according to ComScore, in May, Sun Online topped MailOnline in the U.K. in unique visitors. It is no coincidence that such growth in readership comes alongside independent research, highlighting the trustworthiness of the Times of London and the Wall Street Journal. 
In an era in which veracity is a particular virtue and hyperbole is no longer hip, we are proud to have the most-trusted news brands around the world. These brands offer increasingly important venues for advertisers who want their reputation burnished, not tarnished. It is, thus, unsurprising that The Sun and The Times grew their full year ad revenues for the first time in 7 years. 
Wireless Group saw another strong set of audience figures this quarter, with the listening hours at our [indiscernible] stations up 14% versus the prior year based on the latest industry data, outpacing the overall market. And revenues in the most recent quarter rose significantly, thanks in part to England serendipitous success at the World Cup but also because of the marketing prowess of our U.K. and digital platforms. 
At Dow Jones, fiscal year circulation revenues grew 10%, largely due to digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, there was a solid 7% increase in full year revenues at the Professional Information Business, which is the largest year-on-year jump in their annual revenues since the creation of the new News. There was a particularly pleasing performance in Risk and Compliance as companies recognized the importance of Dow Jones' insight and intelligence in areas crucial to the health of the business. 
The Dow Jones' team is also working closely with the team at Storyful, whose unique understanding of social media around the world is crucial for companies seeking to avoid reputational roadkill. The New York Post is gathering momentum in a tough [ tabloidient ] market and is a standup performer in greater New York, where its positive influence is matched by a positive audience response. The Post digital network, including pagesix.com, had 101 million unique visitors in June, up 51% on the previous year. Clearly, that growth is far superior to that of the New York Times and the struggling Daily News. The Wall Street Journal also added more digital subscribers and had significantly higher circulation revenue growth this quarter than the New York Times. 
In Australia, digital subscriber growth continue to pace, while our team addressed the cost base to stabilize and strengthen the business. The results of that vigilance were reflected in a positive segment EBITDA contribution for the year and a platform for future growth. Cost savings and potential partnerships with traditional rivals around the world, such as Fairfax in Australia and a plethora of publishers in the U.K., have become possible as the media landscape has changed dramatically. But we will never enter into agreements that undermine the essential character of commercial purpose and social role of their publications. 
As for Book Publishing, our team at HarperCollins, through their expert discovery of great authors and empathetic curating of manuscripts and clever marketing campaigns, ensured strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That success was reflected in the popularity of its frontlist titles and in the effective leveraging of its substantial backlist. One benefit of that backlist was the $28 million in revenues coming from the sublicensing deals involving J.R.R. Tolkien's works. As Gandalf observed, perhaps with Chief Executives and investors foremost in mind, ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.""
HarperCollins also saw continued growth in its digital revenues, thanks to the rising popularity of downloadable audio books. And we had substantial success in financial '18 with the strong sales of the best-selling The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Expletive, and from Joanne Gaines' Magnolia Table, which, according to BookScan, is the fastest-selling U.S. cookbook in history. 
In children's books, we had particular success with The Hate U Give, which you'll see in the theaters later this year as a film from 20th Century Fox. 
Now we come to our fastest-growing segment, Digital Real Estate Services, which has been a particular priority since the formation of the new News. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues rose 22% and segment EBITDA rose 24% for the year. We have become the most global digital property company, and we certainly still have the potential for rapid growth without alienating realtors by becoming hot to trot house-flippers. 
At Move, home of realtor.com, core real estate revenues for fiscal '18 grew 20%, with total revenues up a healthy 15% for the year. realtor.com continued to show strong audience gains and maintained its lead -- tangible lead with 1.5x higher engagement compared to its nearest competitor. We are continuously working to improve returns for realtors and enhance experience for customers. It is worth noting that realtor.com has nearly doubled its revenues since the acquisition by News Corp less than 4 years ago. We believe that our largest investment since the split, which has been both lucrative and transforming, is undervalued by Wall Street, given realtor.com's significant revenue expansion, impressive increase in audience and the value of its peers in the digital real estate sector. We remain committed to users of this site, who are making an important investment for their families, and to realtors, whom we have no intention of usurping, unlike certain other companies. 
Meanwhile, in Australia, REA continued to be an industry leader in both audience and innovation, expanding into adjacencies like the mortgage broker business, which has quickly gained traction with 350,000 self-completed financial profiles as of June 30. 
At the close of this fiscal year, 5 years since our rebirth as a company, we are proud to have leaders and creators so strong, passionate and purposeful, and numbers so self-evidently robust and a future that holds much promise for growth in audience, revenue and profit. Behind the impressive results, are the people of News Corp, who serve our readers, members audiences and advertisers, all have contributed to our success this year and over the past 5 years, and have laid the foundations for a particularly prosperous and fecund future for our investors. 
With that, I will turn the microphone over to Susan Panuccio."
212741644,574725142,1541846,"News Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2018",2018-08-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year",2390,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight 5 themes from this past year-end and the quarter where we've made significant progress. We've taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment, and this year, showed tangible improvement through a combination of cost initiatives and digital investments. We are seeing strong digital paid subscriber growth across many of our key properties where digital subscribers now exceed print. Revenues were stable for the quarter and the fiscal year, and the segment EBITDA reflected moderation in declines, a material improvement from recent trends. In addition, we continue to focus on potential industry solutions, which include our recently announced printing agreement for Fairfax in Australia. 
We have focused on strengthening our Digital Real Estate Services platform this year, which we have done by expanding into relevant adjacencies, investing in new businesses and products and growing our core audiences. This segment was our biggest EBITDA contributor, and annual revenues now exceed well over $1 billion and have more than tripled since separation. 
The performance at our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting record revenues since the company separated. 
We completed the Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia combination, which gives operational control to News Corp, reshapes our revenue base and provides more flexibility for News Corp moving forward. 
And we continue to actively look at our portfolio. This year, we sold several noncore investments, including our stake in SEEK Asia and magazines in Australian and continue to evaluate our options with respect to our regional and community newspapers in [indiscernible]. 
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full year fiscal 2018, total revenues were over $9 billion, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. This includes the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestments and currency fluctuations, as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 2%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was nearly $1.1 billion compared to $885 million in the prior year, a 21% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 6%. 
During the full year, we had several non-reoccurring items impacting EPS. Those items included pretax noncash write-downs of $1.2 billion, primarily related to Foxtel/Fox Sports Australia and News America Marketing, which we reported in the third quarter, and a $237 million charge, reflecting certain onetime adjustments as a consequence of the U.S. Tax Act. 
Finally, the fourth quarter included a loss of $337 million related to the Foxtel transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement and the result of the transaction, which is reflected under other net. 
Reported EPS from continuing operations were negative $2.60 compared to negative $1.27 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year. 
And now to the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 29% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 5%. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $312 million compared to $215 million in the prior year, adjusted segment EBITDA, which excludes the Foxtel impact, rose 13%. 
For the quarter, reported EPS were negative $0.64 compared to negative $0.74 a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.08 versus $0.11 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion and rose 1% versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 2% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 5%, with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 1% and circulation and subscription revenues by 2%. 
Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News U.K. rose 4%, News Australia declined 3% and News America Marketing fell 2%. 
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $94 million, down 9% versus the prior year, which is a notable improvement on the declines we experienced in the third quarter. 
There are a few highlights, which I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw strong digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 9% and at the Wall Street Journal they grew 10%, benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 25% year-over-year and up 7% versus our fiscal third quarter. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 27%; and also at News Australia, up 14%. 
The Professional Information Business, or PIB, at Dow Jones posted 6% revenue growth, led again by Risk and Compliance, which grew 35% in the quarter versus the prior year and, as expected, exceeded $100 million in total sales this year. We remain very encouraged by the pipeline and trajectory of growth. Just to frame the size, our PIB products in fiscal 2018 generated 27% of Dow Jones revenues. 
Fourth quarter advertising trends across our news portfolio improved modestly from the fiscal third quarter rate. The U.K. was again a solid performer, with advertising up 6% versus the prior year or flat in local currency, led by digital advertising growth and higher year-on-year performances of both The Sun and The Times. 
News Australia advertising declined 6% versus the prior year in reported and local currency, showing further moderation of print advertising declines. 
Dow Jones advertising was down 10%, also reflecting an improvement in print declines at the Wall Street Journal. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print editions in Q2 impacted Dow Jones advertising revenue by $5 million, accounting for nearly half of the advertising decline in this quarter. 
We remain very focused on cost initiatives, particularly at News Australia. While much work is still to be done, pleasingly, News Australia showed some stability and profitability, helped by ongoing cost initiatives, which have exceeded our initial expectations, and also higher digital revenues. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we have been working with industry participants about potentially shaping or sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies across our key markets. News Corp Australia entered into a commercial printing arrangement with Fairfax Media to provide printing services in New South Wales and Queensland. We expect to realize approximately AUD 10 million of cost savings on an annualized basis from this agreement and continue to explore other opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were relatively stable as weakness in inset products were mostly offset by mid-single digit growth in in-store advertising products. Profit contribution improved due to effective cost management. 
Turning to our Book Publishing segment. We posted a very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, combined with the contribution from the previously announced sublicensing agreement of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 20% to $490 million, and segment EBITDA increased 82% to $71 million. The Tolkien agreement, which highlights the value of intellectual property, impacted revenues by $28 million or 7%. 
This quarter also benefited from several successfully new releases, including Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, as well as the continued strength of backlist titles, such as The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. 
Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 49% of consumer revenues in the quarter, down 54% from last year. While revenues this quarter were driven by the success of the frontlist, backlist revenues still grew at a healthy rate on an absolute basis. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, the highest growth in recent periods due to the strength of the downloadable audiobooks and represented 20% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year. 
In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 19% to $299 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 14% to $99 million. 
REA Group revenues grew 27% due to very strong residential debt-to-revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for premier [indiscernible] and increased yield, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. Revenue growth was partially offset by lower listing volumes. As always, please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details. 
Move revenues rose 11% to $120 million versus the prior year, driven by continued success of its Connections for Buyers product. Connections for Buyers benefited from higher customer flow and yield as well as increased lead volume, albeit at a slower pace than the prior year. 
[indiscernible] real estate revenues, which includes listing and lead-based products, grew 17%. As I mentioned last quarter, we have been reducing our non-listing advertising loads as part of the site redesign, initially within select markets to improve engagement and lead volume with encouraging nearly sign. 
Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 63 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year. 
As expected, Move's expensive were higher this quarter due to planned brand marketing and traffic-acquisition costs to drive revenue growth and partly to increase our traction in New York City. 
We are also rebranding our core suite of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the coming months. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services, which includes the newly combined Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia businesses and Sky News. You will see that we have attached to the press release the pro forma statements for the past [ 2 ] years. Revenues were $610 million versus $140 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, last year's revenues were $643 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $97 million versus $24 million in the prior year. As I alluded to last quarter, reported results for the segment include onetime transaction cost of $12 million. 
On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined to $109 million from $178 million in the prior year, primarily due to the revenue impact I just noted; higher programming costs, which reflect increased NRL and SSI rights cost; as well as $10 million of transition costs. 
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribes were over 2.8 million as of June 30, up nearly 2% versus the prior year and prior quarter, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of the wind down of the T-Box and Optus subscribers. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite residential churn was 12.5%, down from the 13.3%, and ARPU was down 3% to AUD 80 per month. 
In the segment, subscription revenues totaled $523 million for the quarter, accounting for over 85% of segment revenues. Subscription revenues were down 4% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, resulting from the subscriber mix. 
Advertising revenues totaled $67 million for the quarter, accounting for over 10% of segment revenues. Advertising was down 12% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, primarily due to lower advertising at the Foxtel network channels. 
As I mentioned last quarter, there will be some short-term reinvestment required at Foxtel to drive volume and improve the subscriber trajectory. I will briefly describe what these are. Firstly, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we will start to incur the costs associated with the recently acquired Cricket Australia rights. We also face a full year of NRL costs related to the step-up from the new rights contract, which will likely be in the region of AUD 20 million or USD 15 million. 
Secondly, we anticipate the launch of an IP-only sports offering in the second quarter and are also actively considering other nonsports IP-only products targeted at specific demographics. 
Thirdly, the incremental depreciation and amortization as a consequence of the consolidation was approximately $75 million in the quarter. 
Finally, our full year results include approximately $60 million of CapEx related to the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, Foxtel CapEx was approximately $285 million. At this point, we expect Foxtel's fiscal 2019 CapEx to increase by at least $50 million to reflect expenditures related to higher penetration of next-generation set-top boxes, including 4K upgrade and some additional project spend relating to improving its IP platform. It is important to note that a significant amount of Foxtel's CapEx is subscriber related, which includes set-top boxes and capitalized installation costs and will be driven by sales volume.
As Robert mentioned, our goal continues to be driving towards an IPO and believe that improving subscription volumes will be key to our long-term value creation. Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative, and our goal will be to maintain the broadcast subscriber base and manage churn effectively. 
Finally, I would like to mention a few other themes as we enter into fiscal 2019. At News and Information Services, while print advertising trends continue downwards, they have been relatively stable, but visibility remains limited. As a consequence, we are very focused on driving higher penetration of digital paid subscriptions, rolling out new digital advertising solutions and delivering ongoing cost initiatives, particularly in Australia and at News UK. The segment achieved some stability this year, and we remain focused on continued improvements. 
At Subscription Video Services, we expect reinvestments this year, as I mentioned, focusing on launching new OTT products, 4K, the next generation of the IQ box and managing our valuable broadcast space. 
In Book Publishing, overall, we are very pleased with the performance of HarperCollins. Underlying trends seem relatively stable, and we remain focused on expanding our foreign language penetration. We will cycle some challenging comparisons in the coming year, but we are excited about our new releases, including the recent release of Daniel Silva's The Other Woman and a November release of Homebody by Joanna Gaines. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued revenue growth of both REA and Move and for the segment to continue to play an important role in our revenue and EBITDA mix. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

So it's fair to say both the circumstances on the ground and the context of the Australian market give us confidence in the future of Foxtel."

The second question, you're right. If you adjust for M&A and other matters then the costs were flat across News and Information Services.

They have got revenue growth. Obviously, they had revenue growth this year. We're expecting to continue to invest in marketing and acquisition costs as they continue to push those digital subscribers. I think it would be fair to say that News Australia, we're balancing cost reinvestments with costs out. And we do believe that there's more work that can be done down there, and the team is very focused on that. And at News U.K., there is indeed still opportunities around costs out there.

We have comm",1306,"Thanks, Mike. Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We have committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continue to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in realtime and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about prominence and propriety in these countries after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest Panko survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture, and we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand to brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched AT&T Sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year while overall revenues including B2B software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with realtors in realtime. REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion to Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist title like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman, Gregg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax, and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, witch and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate You Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it beholds us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock bonds. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance at HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a [ $48 million ] benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership to Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News U.K. rose 12%, News Australia declined 7% and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, and at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in to existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and marketed, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia along with the onetime impact in News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4%, $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for premier and increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which just concluded for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with connections to buyers lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million and on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding growth age and adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues on transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of [ $680 million ] in the prior year with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues, including a mix shift to lower-priced packages, lower advertising revenue and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the Macgregor Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also was noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscriptions.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly to stabilize and revitalize the broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving content offerings integration marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and [indiscernible] over 10% increase in build ARPU per month, double the pay-per-view buy rates and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a larger base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiatives to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I also remind you that News UK received a onetime benefit relation to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Description Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight: And All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grant. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

The -- really varies paper by paper and country by country. I'll focus on Dow Jones because it's obviously the largest of our properties.

We are commi",1309,"Thanks, Mike. Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continue to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in real time and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about prominence and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. 
We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched AT&T Sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2P software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with realtors in real time. REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock bonds. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in to existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for premier or an increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues on transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the Macgregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offering and the great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a large base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiative to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind  you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to Cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grant. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And having broken through that ceiling, it creates extra opportunities for the highest quality provider. And we are certainly, in terms of programming, the highest quality provider, like in terms of sports, entertainment, documentaries, children's programming. But we haven't, in the past, delivered those services in the way that potential customers have necessarily wanted. So as you know, we have new leadership, we have new technology. We have a new marketing team. And we are genuinely confident that this confluence of an expanded market and an improved product will make a difference to our percentage share."

And we're very optimistic, as I mentioned, not only about the opportunity in the U.S. but actually around the world, where the same trend is now preeminent.

They obviously get the benefit of lower newsprint coming through because of the volumes. And they've also been looking at distribution savings. So they've been going really hard on this with the organizational structure and design and taking cost out where they think it's not going to impact on the end product. So I think they have been very focused on that. They obviously have got the benefit of the cost-out in the previous year. From an annualized perspective it's going through into this year, but they also have to be looking at other cost opportunities in the current year. Just in relation to Subscription Video Services. So your question, can you maybe just repeat your question again in relation to that?"

Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continue to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in real time and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about prominence and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. 
We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched AT&T Sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2P software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with realtors in real time. REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."
212741644,589362239,1604554,"News Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2018",2018-11-07,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert.

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock bonds. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in to existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for premier or an increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues on transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the Macgregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offering and the great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a large base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiative to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind  you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to Cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grant. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

We are commi",1309,"Thanks, Mike. Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continued to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in realtime and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about provenance and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. 
We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched OTT sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. 
As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2B software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with REALTORS in real time. 
REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of the U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock grants. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K., whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in through existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All and increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues upon transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the McGregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly, to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offerings and a great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule, and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a larger base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiatives to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind  you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grants. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

So one thing I'd like to say, if any other publisher around the world, which is now profiting from our efforts would like to send us commission checks, we're welcome to that. The -- really varies paper-by-paper and country-by-country. I'll focus on Dow Jones because it's obviously the largest of our properties. But what -- we're seeing 2 phenomena, which are fruitful: one, continuing to use artificial intelligence to identify, through propensity modeling, new customers and using that modeling as well to provide them with a more satisfying experience; and two, from that, an ability to upsell those customers to higher value-added products from our Professional Information Services."

And that's particularly so as I said with the release this very week of Homebody, which we have great expectations on and the other authors that I mentioned. But it's a tribute, one, to the ability of Brian Murray and his team and Charlie Redmayne in the U.K. to put together groups of editors, who can get the best out of authors and then to make the most of the product by marketing it in a clever way, and also being open to new opportunities, which is what you see with the exponential increase in digital audiobooks. And we're very optimistic, as I mentioned, not only about the opportunity in the U.S. but actually around the world, where the same trend is now preeminent. And in that sense, the team deserves particular praise because, at HarperCollins, we have been the author of our own success."

Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. We are commi",1309,"Thanks, Mike. Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continued to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in realtime and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about provenance and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. 
We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched OTT sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. 
As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2B software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with REALTORS in real time. 
REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of the U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock grants. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K., whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in through existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All and increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues upon transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the McGregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly, to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offerings and a great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule, and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a larger base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiatives to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind  you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grants. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And having broken through that ceiling, it creates extra opportunities for the highest quality provider. And we are certainly, in terms of programming, the highest quality provider, like in terms of sports, entertainment, documentaries, children's programming. But we haven't, in the past, delivered the services in the way that potential customers have necessarily wanted. So as you know, we have new leadership, we have new technology. We have a new marketing team. And we are genuinely confident that this confluence of an expanded market and an improved product will make a difference to our percentage share."

And we're very optimistic, as I mentioned, not only about the opportunity in the U.S. but actually around the world, where the same trend is now preeminent.

So they've been going really hard on this with the organizational structure and design and taking cost out where they think it's not going to impact on the end product. So I think they have been very focused on that. They obviously have got the benefit of the cost-out in the previous year. From an annualized perspective it's going through into this year, but they also have to be looking at other cost opportunities in the current year. Just in relation to Subscription Video Services.

Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. 
We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. 
Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continued to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year.  
In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in realtime and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.
We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about provenance and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.
Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.
Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last 3 years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. 
The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. 
At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the #1 news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.
In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. 
We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.
Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. 
News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.
Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. 
It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.
Our soon-to-be-launched OTT sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. 
As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2B software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company 4 years ago. 
We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with REALTORS in real time. 
REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of the U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.
Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.
Just over 5 years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.
And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers."

We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock grants. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.
We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.
The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.
With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K., whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.
For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.
Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.
At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. 
At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. 
News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.
Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. 
At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in through existing members throughout the year. 
In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.
Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. 
At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All and increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.
Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.
Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.
Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues upon transaction closing.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.
Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the McGregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.
It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.
In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.
The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on 3 key priorities: firstly, to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offerings and a great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule, and drive subscription growth.
The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.
Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. 
The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a larger base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. 
The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.
The third key priority will be focused on cost initiatives to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. 
I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind  you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to cricket should be around USD 25 million to USD 30 million for the second quarter. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grants. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."
