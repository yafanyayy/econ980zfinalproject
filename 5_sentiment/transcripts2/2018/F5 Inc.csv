Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to se",874,"Thank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. 
We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud, and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth. 
First quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.
Product revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; Arrow and Cynics, each accounted for 11%; and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue. 
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by 2 large nonrecurring items, an estimated $7 million tax related to Dean's repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings and an $11.6 million impact from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rates. Turning to the balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million and deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q2. We continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of our next-generation application architectures. While this trend has linked themselves cycles for hardware, days solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of fiscal year '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
We expect the GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%. We anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and will continue to update on a quarterly basis.
And while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year '19, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step-down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year '19 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation. 
Our Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor and analysts meeting in New York on March 8. And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our Virtual Edition and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the competition in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying application across multi-cloud environments. 
Earlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3,000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results showed digital transformation is at the forefront of our customer's mind as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications. 
Multi-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best of breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per application basis. 
Our customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation, aligned with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year. 
During the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and Web application of our services, and we made platform enhancements that reduce the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments. These offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity. 
Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud. 
Taking a closer look at first quarter results. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continue to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security. 
We are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest growing areas of the business. And while we have seen instances of longer sign-up periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. 
We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our client's mix in the coming quarters. We believe this product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.
iSeries provides advantages in key use cases for customers, including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We had several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries. These includes 7-figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization, where our ability to efficiently inspect and reencrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator over competing offerings. 
A large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data. This includes: Inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS production, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5's ability to innovate around scaling to support bidirectional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win. 
During the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring-your-own license and utility offerings. We are present within all 3 major public clouds and providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.
We accelerate growth within the public cloud. We continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business-critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October. 
We joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer's applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption. 
Over the past 6 months, we launched a subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments. 
Our enterprise security momentum remained strong in the first quarter, driven by our life and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customer's growing needs around application security. At F5's core is an unmatched level of application fluency with large, complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base. We continue to extend our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments.
Building on our market-leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security roles available to our common customers through the AWS Marketplace. To date, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Anna, Cara, Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call, focused on clearly aligning our product road map with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that Cara and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business long-term strategy as well as overseeing corporate development in our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March. 
We are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions. We are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority, and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter. With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So I'll start on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation. And we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having. Over the last, I'd say, 2 quarters, we felt the number of these have gotten -- have moved in the right direction. So a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe, I think, our reserve more clarity around Brexit. Generally, the European economies and Continental Europe are doing much better. And so we feel that the macro environment is generally better. And we've made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We've made some leadership changes. We've also realigned our teams towards the what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we're doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We're cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we're also optimistic about what we're seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution. Your second question was on product revenue growth and generally, the customer behaviors that we're seeing. There hasn't been much change on that front since last quarter. In fact, we're seeing 2 things specifically on the iSeries refresh. Number one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product. So we're continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform. On the other hand, we're also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now. As they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we're seeing elongated cycles of decision-making, and that's one of the reasons. I think the key reason why we don't think we've seen the growth acceleration that we would have expected at this point in past cycles."

So that's definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud. But we're also seeing net new use cases. So we do acquire and we did again this quarter, acquired a number of net new logos. So these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in public cloud partners. AWS, Azure or Google. And we're also seeing some types of deployments that we would not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility based.

We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow. We continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular, driven by WAF and the increasing trend towards encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position us very well to deal with that. So security, virtual editions and public cloud, I think, will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year. And then there's some changes we've made. We talked about a realignment during our earnings call 3 months ago. There's some changes we've made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY '18.

And we see opportunity more and demand from our customers to pick on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a SEC ops spire. And so Ram is looking at what's the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that's an immediate priority. And then more broadly, in the space of application security, we're seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by our -- the research we did in our state of application delivery report, where we're seeing as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.

You will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year, and we've reported on that in the state of application delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud. And as part of that, they're having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they're making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per app basis in cloud versus noncloud. And as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You are correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality. For us, frankly, while this has given, I would say, short-term headwinds specifically on hardware and as we said, I think, last quarter, we didn't see on hardware the uptake that we would have seen at this tape in the cycle.

Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we've provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to",875,"Thank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we've provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. 
We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud, and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth. 
First quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.
Product revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; Arrow and Cynics, each accounted for 11%; and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue. 
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by 2 large nonrecurring items, an estimated $7 million tax related to Dean's repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings and an $11.6 million impact from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rates. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million and deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share, for a total of $150 million. 
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q2. We continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of our next-generation application architectures. While this trend has linked the sale cycles for hardware day solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of fiscal year '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
We expect the GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%. We anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and we'll continue to update on a quarterly basis.
And while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year '19, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step-down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year '19 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation. 
Our Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor and analysts meeting in New York on March 8. And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our virtual editions and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the conversation in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying applications across multi-cloud environments. 
Earlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3,000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results show digital transformation is at the forefront of our customers' mind as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications. 
Multi-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best-of-breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds, with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per-application basis. 
Our customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation align with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year. 
During the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and web application firewall services, and we made platform enhancements that reduce the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments. These offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity.  Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud. 
Taking a closer look at first quarter results. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continue to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security. 
We are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest-growing areas of the business. And while we have seen instances of longer sign-up periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. 
We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our client's mix in the coming quarters. We believe this product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.
iSeries provides advantages in key use cases for customers, including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We have several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries. These includes 7-figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization, where our ability to efficiently inspect and re-encrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator over competing offerings. 
A large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data. This includes: Inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS protection, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5's ability to innovate around scaling to support bidirectional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win. 
During the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring-your-own license and utility offerings. We are present within all 3 major public clouds and providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.
To accelerate growth within the public cloud. We continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services' networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business-critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October. 
We joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer's applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption. 
Over the past 6 months, we launched our subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments. 
Our enterprise security momentum remained strong in the first quarter, driven by our WAF and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers' growing needs around application security. At F5's core is an unmatched level of application fluency with large, complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base. We continue to expand our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments.
Building on our market-leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security roles available to our common customers through the AWS Marketplace. 
To date, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Anna, Cara, Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call, focused on clearly aligning our product roadmap with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that Cara and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business' long-term strategy as well as overseeing corporate development in our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March. 
We are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions. We are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority, and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter. With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So I'll start on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation. And we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having. Over the last, I'd say, 2 quarters, we felt a number of these have got -- have moved in the right direction. So a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe, I think, our resolve is more clarity around Brexit. Generally, the European economies and Continental Europe are doing much better. And so we feel that the macro environment is generally better. And we've made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We've made some leadership changes. We've also realigned our teams towards the -- what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we're doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We're cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we're also optimistic about what we're seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution. Your second question was on product revenue growth and, generally, the customer behaviors that we're seeing. There hasn't been much change on that front since last quarter. In fact, we're seeing 2 things specifically on the iSeries refresh. Number one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product. So we're continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform. On the other hand, we're also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware, in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now. As they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we're seeing elongated cycles of decision-making, and that's one of the reasons. I think the key reason, why we don't think we've seen the growth acceleration that we would've expected at this point in past cycles."

And generally, we have a very strong attach rate to these applications, but I can't -- I think in these use cases, it is substituted to something we would've done on-prem in the past. So that's definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud. But we're also seeing net new use cases. So we do acquire, and we did again this quarter, acquired a number of net new logos. So these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in public cloud partners, AWS, Azure or Google. And we're also seeing some types of deployments that we would have not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility-based. This is where customers are essentially renting F5 virtual editions for hours, and we're already billing several millions of hours of virtual edition in public cloud today. And that's net new incremental for us. That's not opportunities we would've had access to before."

We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow. We continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular, driven by WAF, and the increasing trend towards encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position very well -- position us very well to deal with that. So security, virtual editions and public cloud, I think, will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year. And then there's some changes we've made. We talked about a realignment during our earnings call 3 months ago. There's some changes we've made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY '18.

And when we renew, we can capture the revenue for the period of time that's gone by between the expiration of the contract and the renewal.

One of the immediate elements of what Ram is working on is we have been quite successful selling security attached to our ADC. And we see opportunity more and more and demand from our customers to pick on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a sec ops hire. And so Ram is looking at what's the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that's an immediate priority. And then more broadly, in the space of application security, we're seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by our -- the research we did in our state of application delivery report, where we're seeing that as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.

You will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year, and we've reported on that in the State of Application Delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud, and as part of that, they're having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they're making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per-app basis in cloud versus noncloud. And as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You are correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality.

Overall, we think over the long run, it bodes very well for us because we feel that we are probably uniquely positioned to serve these needs across multi-cloud environments with our hardware, on-premises, our software on-premise, and increasingly, our software in the public cloud with multiple consumption models across all these environments. There aren't -- there isn't any other company that really has the breadth of offerings for supporting these multi-cloud strategies.."

Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to se",879,"Thank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. 
We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud, and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth. 
First quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.
Product revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; Arrow and [ Cynics ], each accounted for 11%; and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue. 
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by 2 large nonrecurring items, an estimated $7 million tax related to Dean's repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings and an $11.6 million impact from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rates. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million and deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share, for a total of $150 million. 
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q2. We continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of the next-generation application architectures. While this trend has linked [ the sale ] cycles for hardware day solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of fiscal year '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%. We anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and we'll continue to update on a quarterly basis.
And while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year '19, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step-down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year '19 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation. 
Our Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor and analysts meeting in New York on March 8. And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our virtual editions and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the conversation in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying applications across multi-cloud environments. 
Earlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3,000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results show digital transformation is at the forefront of our customers' minds as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications. 
Multi-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best-of-breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds, with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per-application basis. 
Our customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation align with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year. 
During the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and web application firewall services, and we made platform enhancements that reduce the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments. These offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity.  Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud. 
Taking a closer look at first quarter results. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continue to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security. 
We are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest-growing areas of the business. And while we have seen instances of longer sign-up periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. 
We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our clients' mix in the coming quarters. We believe this product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.
iSeries provides advantages in key use cases for customers, including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We have several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries. These includes 7-figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization, where our ability to efficiently inspect and re-encrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator over competing offerings. 
A large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data. This includes: Inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS protection, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5's ability to innovate around scaling to support bidirectional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win. 
During the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring-your-own license and utility offerings. We are present within all 3 major public clouds and providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.
To accelerate growth within the public cloud, we continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services' networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business-critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October. 
We joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer's applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption. 
Over the past 6 months, we launched our subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments. 
Our enterprise security momentum remained strong in the first quarter, driven by our WAF and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers' growing needs around application security. At F5's core is an unmatched level of application fluency with large, complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base. We continue to expand our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments.
Building on our market-leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security [ roles ] available to our common customers through the AWS Marketplace. 
Today, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Anna, [ Cara ], Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call. Focus on clearly aligning our product roadmap with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that [ Cara ] and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business' long-term strategy as well as overseeing corporate development in our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March. 
We are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions. We are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority, and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter. With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So I'll start on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation. And we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having. Over the last, I'd say, 2 quarters, we felt a number of these have got -- have moved in the right direction. So a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe, I think, our resolve is more clarity around Brexit. Generally, the European economies and Continental Europe are doing much better. And so we feel that the macro environment is generally better. And we've made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We've made some leadership changes. We've also realigned our teams towards the -- what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we're doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We're cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we're also optimistic about what we're seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution. Your second question was on product revenue growth and, generally, the customer behaviors that we're seeing. There hasn't been much change on that front since last quarter. In fact, we're seeing 2 things specifically on the iSeries refresh. Number one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product. So we're continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform. On the other hand, we're also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware, in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now. As they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we're seeing elongated cycles of decision-making, and that's one of the reasons. I think the key reason, why we don't think we've seen the growth acceleration that we would've expected at this point in past cycles."

So that's definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud. But we're also seeing net new use cases. So we do acquire, and we did again this quarter, acquired a number of net new logos. So these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in public cloud partners, AWS, Azure or Google. And we're also seeing some types of deployments that we would have not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility-based. This is where customers are essentially renting F5 virtual editions for hours, and we're already billing several millions of hours of virtual edition in public cloud today. And that's net new incremental for us. That's not opportunities we would've had access to before."

So I think the -- actually, from an iSeries refresh perspective, we don't see a change. We think the demand for the product is very healthy. And as I've said, we're seeing new use cases for the product in IoT, high transactional applications, et cetera. And we think that's going to continue for the longer term. There are, though, some product drivers of product revenue growth that we think are kicking in and probably will accelerate in the second half of the year. Virtual editions will continue to grow. We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow. We continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular, driven by WAF, and the increasing trend towards encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position very well -- position us very well to deal with that. So security, virtual editions and public cloud, I think, will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year. And then there's some changes we've made. We talked about a realignment during our earnings call 3 months ago. There's some changes we've made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY '18. So when you factor all of that, I think we feel pretty good about what we've said last quarter, which is continued improvement in product revenue performance throughout the year."

And we see opportunity more and more and demand from our customers to pick on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a sec ops hire. And so Ram is looking at what's the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that's an immediate priority. And then more broadly, in the space of application security, we're seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by our -- the research we did in our State of Application Delivery report, where we're seeing that as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.

You will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year, and we've reported on that in the State of Application Delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud, and as part of that, they're having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they're making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per-app basis in cloud versus noncloud. And as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You are correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality. For us, frankly, while this has given, I would say, short-term headwinds, specifically on hardware and as we said, I think, last quarter, we didn't see on hardware the uptake that we would have seen at this tape in the cycle. Overall, we think over the long run, it bodes very well for us because we feel that we are probably uniquely positioned to serve these needs across multi-cloud environments with our hardware, on-premises, our software on-premise, and increasingly, our software in the public cloud with multiple consumption models across all these environments. There aren't -- there isn't any other company that really has the breadth of offerings for supporting these multi-cloud strategies."

Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to se",879,"Thank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 '18 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. 
We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud, and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth. 
First quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.
Product revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; Arrow and [ Cynics ], each accounted for 11%; and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue. 
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by 2 large nonrecurring items, an estimated $7 million tax related to Dean's repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings and an $11.6 million impact from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rates. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million and deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share, for a total of $150 million. 
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q2. We continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of the next-generation application architectures. While this trend has linked [ the sale ] cycles for hardware day solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. 
With this in mind, for the second quarter of fiscal year '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%. We anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and we'll continue to update on a quarterly basis.
And while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year '19, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step-down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year '19 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation. 
Our Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor and analysts meeting in New York on March 8. And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our virtual editions and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the conversation in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying applications across multi-cloud environments. 
Earlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3,000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results show digital transformation is at the forefront of our customers' minds as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications. 
Multi-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best-of-breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds, with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per-application basis. 
Our customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation align with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year. 
During the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and web application firewall services, and we made platform enhancements that reduce the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments. These offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity.  Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud. 
Taking a closer look at first quarter results. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continue to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security. 
We are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest-growing areas of the business. And while we have seen instances of longer sign-up periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. 
We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our clients' mix in the coming quarters. We believe this product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.
iSeries provides advantages in key use cases for customers, including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We have several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries. These includes 7-figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization, where our ability to efficiently inspect and re-encrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator over competing offerings. 
A large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data. This includes: Inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS protection, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5's ability to innovate around scaling to support bidirectional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win. 
During the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring-your-own license and utility offerings. We are present within all 3 major public clouds and providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.
To accelerate growth within the public cloud, we continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services' networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business-critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October. 
We joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer's applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption. 
Over the past 6 months, we launched our subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments. 
Our enterprise security momentum remained strong in the first quarter, driven by our WAF and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers' growing needs around application security. At F5's core is an unmatched level of application fluency with large, complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base. We continue to expand our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments.
Building on our market-leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security [ roles ] available to our common customers through the AWS Marketplace. 
Today, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Anna, [ Cara ], Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call. Focus on clearly aligning our product roadmap with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that [ Cara ] and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business' long-term strategy as well as overseeing corporate development in our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March. 
We are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions. We are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority, and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter. With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So I'll start on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation. And we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having. Over the last, I'd say, 2 quarters, we felt a number of these have got -- have moved in the right direction. So a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe, I think, our resolve is more clarity around Brexit. Generally, the European economies and Continental Europe are doing much better. And so we feel that the macro environment is generally better. And we've made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We've made some leadership changes. We've also realigned our teams towards the -- what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we're doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We're cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we're also optimistic about what we're seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution. Your second question was on product revenue growth and, generally, the customer behaviors that we're seeing. There hasn't been much change on that front since last quarter. In fact, we're seeing 2 things specifically on the iSeries refresh. Number one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product. So we're continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform. On the other hand, we're also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware, in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now. As they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we're seeing elongated cycles of decision-making, and that's one of the reasons. I think the key reason, why we don't think we've seen the growth acceleration that we would've expected at this point in past cycles."

So that's definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud. But we're also seeing net new use cases. So we do acquire, and we did again this quarter, acquired a number of net new logos. So these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in public cloud partners, AWS, Azure or Google. And we're also seeing some types of deployments that we would have not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility-based.

And that's net new incremental for us. That's not opportunities we would've had access to before."

And as I've said, we're seeing new use cases for the product in IoT, high transactional applications, et cetera. And we think that's going to continue for the longer term. There are, though, some product drivers of product revenue growth that we think are kicking in and probably will accelerate in the second half of the year. Virtual editions will continue to grow. We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow. We continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular, driven by WAF, and the increasing trend towards encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position very well -- position us very well to deal with that. So security, virtual editions and public cloud, I think, will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year. And then there's some changes we've made. We talked about a realignment during our earnings call 3 months ago. There's some changes we've made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY '18. So when you factor all of that, I think we feel pretty good about what we've said last quarter, which is continued improvement in product revenue performance throughout the year."

And we see opportunity more and more and demand from our customers to pick on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a sec ops hire. And so Ram is looking at what's the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that's an immediate priority. And then more broadly, in the space of application security, we're seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by our -- the research we did in our State of Application Delivery report, where we're seeing that as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.

And I would say qualitatively that, that portion of the business that's driven by security is growing every quarter. The other data point I'd give you is that as our public cloud business grows, the security attach rate in the public cloud is about double what it is on-prem, and that's because of the complexities of securing applications in public cloud. So that's as far as I'll go as far as quantifying our security business. Generally, the trends are up and more important for us."

So there are multiple responsibilities for Tom Fountain, who's joined us last week as our Chief Strategy Officer. One is we have initiated a number of incubation initiatives, where we're looking at new developments that would have a potentially long-term growth opportunities for F5. And these are under Tom, in part because Tom has also background in venture capital and can help us provide the right oversight for this part of the business. Tom also owns our business development group and our relationships with a number of companies with whom we have partnerships in the IT space. And these partnerships are actually quite important for the top line because we co-market, we co-sale, we do certifications, we are integrated in their environments, whether it be SDN environments or next generation IT architectures. And so those partnerships are key to short-term revenues, and Tom is going to help drive that with the business development group. And then the last portion of Tom's responsibility is in fact corporate development. And in that, Tom has the experience to help us with the build versus buy decisions that we think we will be making as we assess opportunities in security and elsewhere around developing our portfolio."

You will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year, and we've reported on that in the State of Application Delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud, and as part of that, they're having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they're making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per-app basis in cloud versus noncloud. And as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You are correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality. For us, frankly, while this has given, I would say, short-term headwinds, specifically on hardware and as we said, I think, last quarter, we didn't see on hardware the uptake that we would have seen at this tape in the cycle. Overall, we think over the long run, it bodes very well for us because we feel that we are probably uniquely positioned to serve these needs across multi-cloud environments with our hardware, on-premises, our software on-premise, and increasingly, our software in the public cloud with multiple consumption models across all these environments. There aren't -- there isn't any other company that really has the breadth of offerings for supporting these multi-cloud strategies."

We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures. And our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Second quarter revenue of $533 million, up 3% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $525,000 to $535,000,000. GAAP EPS of $1.77 per share was above our guidance of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.31 per share was also above our guidance of $2.24 to $2.27 per share.
Product revenue of $238 million in the second quarter was down 1% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Software in Q2 was 15% of product revenue and was up 28% year-over-year. Systems revenue declined 5% year-over-year and made up 85% of product revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 26% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, grew 2% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 6% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21% and government sales were 13%, including 5% from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 17% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; and Arrow, Cynics and Westcon each accounted for 11% of revenue.
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses of $300 million were within our $296 million to $306 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $264 million.  Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.9% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%. 
Turning to the balance sheet.
In Q2, we generated $185 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.7% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,385 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $140.82 per share for a total of $150 million.
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q3. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see momentum building in the business, as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We expect further improvement in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter, highlighted by a return to year-over-year product revenue growth. With this in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal '18, we are targeting revenue in the range of $535 million to $545 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $297 million to $307 million, including approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the third quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. And our Q3 GAAP earnings target is $1.79 to $1.82 per share.
Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to to François."

During the second quarter, we saw momentum across the business. Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by deployments in the public cloud, as our customers increasing you look to support and protect our applications across multi-cloud environment. We saw strong demand for our security solutions and our enterprise customers and the web application firewall, identity and access management and SSL capabilities. 
Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margin above 86%.  This group provides customer support that is unmatched by any of our competitors, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction and stickiness. The value of our services capabilities only grows as complexities associated with multi-cloud deployment impact more customers. We have strong execution during the second quarter and we are encouraged by the underlying trends as we move into the second half of fiscal 2018. Our software solutions are gaining traction across deployment environments with strength in public cloud, bring-your-own license and utility-based consumption.
We saw good customer interest in our recently introduced consumption models, particularly enterprise license agreements. The ability to offer more flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual edition is enabling more strategic competition with customers allowing us to reach a broader set of buyers. 
During the quarter, we closed several meaningful ELAs including a transaction with a U.S.-based communication services company, which also included a hardware refresh and service renewal.
Through an ELA structure for our virtual edition, we were able to meet the customer's need for enabling speed to market for their applications and frictionless movement between cloud providers, as the aggressively rollout a multi-cloud strategy. Our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial technology provider helped us replace an incumbent vast vendor in an account where we were not historically, the primary ADC all WAP. Key to winning this deal was the breadth of our last functionality. The flexibility for enabling speed to market for application services provisioning.  And the ability for our virtual editions to interact with our Silverline WAF and DDoS services. 
In both transactions, our ability to structure ELAs build larger overall opportunities for F5. The traction we are seeing in software will be further enhanced by the introduction of big IT cloud edition, which we officially announced earlier today. This release allows us to better reach the next tier of applications within our existing customers through improvements and usability and comprehensive visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution gives customers a lightweight option, when developing, deploying and securing all application at every step in the testing and production pipeline, including used cases designed around public and private clouds.
Security is a critical component of an increasing number of our customer interactions. We saw good momentum in our WAF offering, which delivered a solid year-over-year growth during Q2. We also saw growing customer interest in our identity and SSL solutions targeted at enterprise accounts. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at the U.S. government agency driven by the performance of our BIG-IP appliances with our WAF modules. A key differentiation in this deal was our ability to scale well in excess of the competition to meet the customers' need to protect over 100 global Web-based applications.
Our industry leading WAF portfolio takes another meaningful step ahead of the competition with the availability of our advanced WAF offering, an important component of our stand-alone security strategy. We have customized the form factor, features and user interface in ways that enable securities to use the focus on getting the information they need to know, when they need to know it. As we outlined in March, we see additions to our security portfolio over the course of 2018, opening substantial new addressable opportunity. Coenhancements with advanced WAF include both the section beyond signatures and repetition to block evolving automated attacks. Application layer encryption to protect against potential threats and DDoS detection using machine learning and behavioral analytics and Layer 7. 
Advanced WAF supports a variety of consumption and licensing models including a per-app perpetual, subscription and utility billing. We are already seeing strong customer interest in the differentiated capabilities provided by our advanced WAF, which is evident in a deal we won during the second quarter at a large African Stock Exchange, where our behavioral DDoS capabilities in-browser encryption and our ability to integrate with our Silverline offering allowed us to stand out from traditional WAF vendors and cloud native solutions.
In a situation where the customer is migrating workloads to a multi-cloud environment, the ability to centralize critical security services and the cost savings versus individual cloud provider offerings resonated with the customer. 
From an organizational perspective, we are excited to announce Frank Pelzer has agreed to joint F5 team as our new CFO starting on May 21. Frank brings to F5 tremendous software and cloud experience, most recently, as the President and COO of the Cloud Business Group at SAP. Previously, he was CFO at Concur Technologies, a leading publicly traded cloud-based travel and expense management solution that was purchased by SAP in 2014.
Frank's background makes him an ideal fit for the next phase of F5's growth. We also announced today that John DiLullo, our EVP of Worldwide Sales will be leaving the company in May to pursue other opportunities. McMillan Our Head of Global Services will oversee the, while we undertake a full search to find John's permanent successor. In John's time at F5, he laid a restructuring of F5 sales organization, including evolving our channel program to better address cloud enablement partners in security opportunities. With a strong set of leads now in place, the organization is structured for success, as is evident in our improved execution over the past several quarters. 
As we outlined at our March Analyst and Investor Meeting, we are evolving from an ADC company to a multi-cloud application service company that will reach every app anywhere. Our conviction that multi-cloud application services will define the next phase of F5's growth is only bolstered by my with our customers. Having spent time with dozens of vendors past year in every theater and across a diverse set of industries, not 1 of them believes the complexities they are facing managing their apps across multiple clouds can be solved by a single generalist cloud provider.
They require a focused player, who understand the intricacies of enterprise applications. While we have meaningful work ahead of us to achieve the goals we outlined in early March, I am pleased with our execution over the past several quarters, both in delivering to the near-term financial targets that they we have laid out and with the progress in prioritizing and accelerating efforts in product development and go-to-market. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we see momentum both in terms of growing our product revenue and continuing to deliver strong profitability, and cash generation.
We are focused on executing to the long-term strategy that we outlined in March and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming quarters. 
Finally, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the second quarter. In particular, I want to thank, Andy for his contributions over the past 20 years, as he will be retiring from F5 in May. Andy was a key part of growing F5 into the $2 billion annual business it is today and filling the structure and discipline that helped drive our enviable margin and cash generations. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year, and I know, I speak for everyone at F5 in wishing him nothing, but happiness and success in his future endeavors.
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I'll start with the latter part. I think what we've seen last year is that a number of customers, who are considering or reconsidering their architecture, especially looking to move towards a multi-cloud environment and try to figure out how much they would deploy in hardware, how much they would deploy in software, what will be in public cloud and private cloud, and so forth. I think we talked about last year saying the decision cycle in some cases was causing some pause in their decision-making. I think to a certain extent that still exist, and we still see that dynamic in the marketplace. But I think we see also a number of customers that have kind of major decisions on their architecture and therefore, they are moving forward on their decisions. And whether it's ELAs in software or some hardware deployments, they're just moving forward. So I think, that's the dynamic we're seeing in the market. I think in a number of cases, we also see customers, who have waited to make these decisions, but application traffic and the pressure is on traffic kind of catches up with them and at the point they had to move forward and make their decisions. So that's a dynamic in the market. In terms of ELAs, Jason, that's an offering and that's only been in the market for us really only a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased with the traction that we're seeing with this mode of consumption. It just gives a lot more flexibility to our customers to deploy their -- our technologies in a frictionless way across on-prem or public cloud.

In terms of the implications for the sales organization. I would say, number one, we are largely going after our existing customer. So that the same large enterprises and large service providers that have been customers of F5 are the customers that want to consume us in the ELA. So it doesn't require for our sales organization to find an entirely new set of customers. We're talking about providing a different consumption model to our existing customers. We have been preparing the sales organization for this. So it's really more about enablement and making sure that the team understand the intricacies of these commercial models, and also making sure we have the right incentives in place. And so at the beginning of this year, we put some incentives in place for our sales organization to make sure that it was attractive for them to sell and market these ELAs. And I think, we're seeing the traction as a result of that."

So there's a broad range of products that we introduced actually in our Q1 that are getting strong traction. We are talking about WAF in part because we introduced an advanced WAF product that is very differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to extend our addressable opportunity, because it addresses a number of used cases, we weren't addressing before, including things like 7 DDoS analytics are preventing credential theft and abuse we're the only vendor will provide these capabilities today. So we're highlighting, not introduction, but the traction is pretty broad. Overall, in terms of growth in the security space, I'd say we did expect to be growing in the area.

I would say first of all, the majority of our software business is in the virtual editions. But a growing part of the consumption of the virtual edition is across multiple cloud, including consumptions of virtual editions in the public cloud. And so today, our customers by virtual editions for on-prem deployment, but they also buy them to them in Amazon or Azure or Google public cloud and that's growing part of this software business. The other factor, which is going to be, I think, an accelerating factor in that is introduction of our cloud edition today, really makes the consumption of virtual editions in the public cloud a lot easier. A, because it provides a lighter weight virtual editions to be used and a lot of deployed in the public cloud want to do in on per-app basis. And B, because we provide a -- with the cloud edition, a centralized orchestration mechanism that allows customers to turn virtual editions on and off or even to scale the deployment of virtual editions across multiple clouds or across on-prem in public clouds. So it's a big catalyst for virtual editions deployment across multi-cloud."

The short answer to that is no, we are not. And largely because customers who use the virtual edition today, they use it to typically support multiple applications, basically 5 to 8 applications, I would say on average. And the virtual edition is only to be used on a per-app basis, and there are very few customers who use our classic VE on a per-app basis. So I think, the cannibalization will be minimal. The other aspect of that is, the per-app virtual edition also allows our customers to support and put virtual editions in front of applications that traditionally would not had them. So it's an expansion of used cases for us. Including in security. Virtual edition -- this cloud edition is a great vehicle for our customers to put, for example, a web application filed in front of all their applications, which increasingly they want to do and sometimes they are required to do by regulation. So to the second point around, which customers are deploying our software. I would say, it's actually in both existing and new customers. Most of our large customers are considering some form of addition of software to their existing hardware deployments. But we also have net-new customers who haven't bought any hardware from F5 and are going straight to overture addition, either in the cloud or in their own data centers."

It's actually linked to your second question. What we're seeing is both in web firewall market and in the DDoS market, which is where Silverline has been focused, is the ability to offer both the on-prim solution and essentially in offprem center solution is actually key for a lot of large enterprise customers. And beyond that the ability for us to signal from an on-prem solution to a customer that they should divert their traffic to scrubbing center on an automated basis is absolutely a key differentiator and that's really what Silverline brings to the table is, that we have this ability to offer on Prem in our prime solution and very strong signaling between the 2 solutions. And that's really the differentiator between us and other vendors that are either purely in the cloud DDoS or cloud WAF space or purely on the on-prem space. In terms of software and security. I think I'd talked to separate those 2. In security, we compete with basically a number of players, and it really depends on the used case and that type of solution. In the space of -- in software, really, I think we have perhaps smaller competitors that have an interesting story around nimbleness and agility of deployment. But what we've seen is really what the customer wants is both the agility of deployment and a depth and breadth of features to support critical applications. And I think with the cloud edition, we're essentially the only player that really brings both of those things to the market for the first time.

So what you should see in terms of new products is, so we did announce some of the products in our app protect portfolio and campaign in February, including the event We are going to release the cloud edition at the end of May this year.

And then you will see, also from us, in the first half of '19, some exciting announcements, generally in the software space and cloud solutions. So I think, over the next 12 months, we're bringing to market some new solutions that essentially extend our addressable market into new use cases. In the hardware space, we have released a new variant of our iSeries, both at the low end and at the high-end. First iSeries with 100 gig capabilities, and we're seeing quite a bit of traction with that capability coming up because moving to 100-gig in data centers is not just in our ADC category, but across a number of other categories, that's a hot topic at the moment. So that's the -- that's what's ahead. Well, your Second question was about share gains in virtual ADC and hardware. On that topic, I think, what we've said at our conference really stands in that. We feel that overall, our hardware business, if you look at 2018, we expect that to decline in the low single digit to flat. I think overall, based on what we see is market forecast, we will gain share because the expectation in the market is declining at mid-single digit. And the reason I feel pretty good about that share gain is because, I feel good about our position with service providers. I feel very good about the use cases that iSeries is enabling and the breadth of use cases that we can attack. And I feel very good about the composition we are having with customers, having made their decisions on architecture. So I think, I stand by what we set our aim. In case of virtual ADC space, it's more of a nascent space, but growing fast, and I think, if we maintain the growth rate that you've been seeing for the first half of the year, we clearly will be gaining share in that market."

We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures. And our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Second quarter revenue of $533 million, up 3% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $525 million to $535 million. GAAP EPS of $1.77 per share was above our guidance of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.31 per share was also above our guidance of $2.24 to $2.27 per share.
Product revenue of $238 million in the second quarter was down 1% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Software in Q2 was 15% of product revenue and was up 28% year-over-year. Systems revenue declined 5% year-over-year and made up 85% of product revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 26% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, grew 2% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 6% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%. And government sales were 13%, including 5% from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 17% of total revenue. Tech Data accounted for 12%. And Arrow, Cynics and Westcon each accounted for 11% of revenue.
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses of $300 million were within our $296 million to $306 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $264 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.9%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $185 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.4 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.7% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,385 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $140.82 per share for a total of $150 million.
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q3. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see momentum building in the business as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We expect further improvement in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter, highlighted by a return to year-over-year product revenue growth. With this in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $535 million to $545 million. We expect the GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. 
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $297 million to $307 million, including approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect the GAAP our effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the third quarter and the non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. And our Q3 GAAP earnings target is $1.79 to $1.82 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the second quarter, we saw momentum across the business. Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by deployments in the public cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environment. 
We saw strong demand for our security solutions at our enterprise customers as they embrace our Web Application Firewall, identity and access management and SSL capabilities. 
Our Services business had another solid quarter, with revenue up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margins above 86%. This group provides customer support that is unmatched by any of our competitors, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction and stickiness.  The value of our services capabilities only grows, as complexities associated with multi-cloud deployment impact more customers. 
We have strong execution during the second quarter, and we are encouraged by the underlying trends as we move into the second half of fiscal 2018. Our software solutions are gaining traction across deployment environments, with strength in public cloud, bring your own license and utility-based consumption.
We saw good customer interest in our recently introduced consumption models, particularly Enterprise License Agreements. The ability to offer more flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions is enabling more strategic conversations with customers, allowing us to reach a broader set of buyers. 
During the quarter, we closed several meaningful ELAs, including a transaction with a U.S.-based communication services company, which also included a hardware refresh and service renewal. Through an ELA structure for our virtual editions, we were able to meet the customer's need for enabling speed-to-market for their applications and frictionless movement between cloud providers, as they aggressively roll out a multi-cloud strategy. 
Our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial technology provider helped us replace an incumbent WAF vendor in an account where we were not historically the primary ADC or WAF. Key to winning this deal was the breadth of our WAF functionality, the flexibility for enabling speed-to-market for application services provisioning and the ability for our virtual editions to interact with our Silverline WAF and DDoS services. In both transactions, our ability to structure ELAs drove larger overall opportunities for F5. 
The traction we are seeing in software will be further enhanced by the introduction of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially announced earlier today. This release allows us to better reach the next tier of applications within our existing customers through improvements and usability and comprehensive per-app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution gives customers a lightweight option when developing, deploying and securing all applications at every step in the testing and production pipeline, including use cases designed around public and private clouds.
Security is a critical component of an increasing number of our customer interactions. We saw good momentum in our WAF offerings, which delivered a solid year-over-year growth during Q2. We also saw growing customer interest in our identity and SSL solutions targeted at enterprise accounts. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a U.S. government agency driven by the performance of our BIG-IP appliances with our WAF modules. A key differentiation in this deal was our ability to scale well in excess of the competition to meet the customer's need to protect over 100 global Web-based applications.
Our industry-leading WAF portfolio takes another meaningful step ahead of the competition with the availability of our advanced WAF offering, an important component of our stand-alone security strategy. We have customized the form factor, features and user interface in way that enables security teams to focus on getting the information they need to know when they need to know it. 
As we outlined in March, we see additions to our security portfolio over the course of 2018, opening substantial new addressable opportunity. Core enhancements with Advanced WAF include bug detection beyond signatures and repetition to block evolving automated attacks, application-layer encryption to protect against credential theft and DDoS detection using machine learning and behavioral analytics at Layer 7. Advanced WAF supports a variety of consumption and licensing models, including a per-app, perpetual, subscription and utility billing. 
We are already seeing strong customer interest in the differentiated capabilities provided by our Advanced WAF, which is evident in a deal we won during the second quarter at a large African stock exchange, where our behavioral DDoS capabilities, in-browser encryption and ability to integrate with our Silverline offering allowed us to stand out from traditional WAF vendors and cloud-native solutions. In a situation where the customer is migrating workloads to a multi-cloud environment, the ability to centralize critical security services and the cost savings versus individual cloud provider offerings resonated with the customer. 
From an organizational perspective, we are excited to announce Frank Pelzer has agreed to join the F5 team as our new CFO starting on May 21. Frank brings to F5 tremendous software and cloud experience, most recently as the President and COO of the Cloud Business Group at SAP. Previously, he was CFO at Concur Technologies, a leading publicly traded cloud-based travel and expense management solution that was purchased by SAP in 2014.  Frank's background makes him an ideal fit for the next phase of F5's growth. 
We also announced today that John DiLullo, our EVP of Worldwide Sales, will be leaving the company in May to pursue other opportunities. Steve McMillan, our Head of Global Services, will oversee the sales organization while we undertake a full search to find John's permanent successor. In John's time at F5, he laid a restructuring of F5's sales organization, including evolving our channel program to better address cloud enablement partners and security opportunities. With a strong set of theater leads now in place, the organization is structured for success, as is evident in our improved execution over the past several quarters. 
As we outlined at our March Analyst and Investor Meeting, we are evolving from an ADC company to a multi-cloud application service company that will reach every app anywhere. Our conviction that multi-cloud application services will define the next phase of F5's growth is only bolstered by my conversations with our customers. Having spent time with dozens of vendors past year in every theater and across a diverse set of industries, not one of them believes the complexities they are facing in managing their apps across multiple clouds can be solved by a single generalist cloud provider. They require a focused player who understands the intricacies of enterprise applications. 
While we have meaningful work ahead of us to achieve the goals we outlined in early March, I am pleased with our execution over the past several quarters, both in delivering to the near-term financial targets we have laid out and with the progress in prioritizing and accelerating efforts in product development and go-to-market. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we see momentum both in terms of growing our product revenue and in continuing to deliver strong profitability and cash generation. We are focused on executing to the long-term strategy that we outlined in March, and we look forward to updating you on our continued -- on continued progress over the coming quarters. 
Finally, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the second quarter. In particular, I want to thank, Andy for his contributions over the past 20 years, as he will be retiring from F5 in May. Andy was a key part of growing F5 into the $2 billion annual business it is today, instilling the structure and discipline that helped drive our enviable margins and cash generations. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year, and I know I speak for everyone at F5 in wishing him nothing but happiness and success in his future endeavors.
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I'll start with the latter part. The -- I think what we've seen last year is a number of customers, who are considering or reconsidering their architecture, especially looking to move towards a multi-cloud environment and trying to figure out how much they would deploy in hardware, how much they would deploy in software, what would be in public cloud and private clouds and so forth. I think we talked about it last year, saying the decision cycle in some cases was causing some pause in their decision-making. I think to a certain extent, that still exists and we still see that dynamic in the marketplace. But I think we see also a number of customers that have kind of made their decisions on their architecture, and therefore, they're moving forward on their decisions. And whether it's ELAs in software or some hardware deployments, they're just moving forward. So I think that's the dynamic we're seeing in the market. I think in a number of cases, we also see customers, who have waited to make these decisions, but application traffic and the pressures on traffic kind of catches up with them. And at some point, they have to move forward and make their decisions. So that's a dynamic in the market. In terms of ELAs, Jason, we're -- that's an offering and that's only been in the market for us for really only a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased with the traction that we're seeing with this mode of consumption. It just gives a lot more flexibility to our customers to deploy our technologies in a frictionless way across on-prem or public cloud. And the -- both the initial traction and the initial deals that we're seeing are in fact pretty chunky."

In terms of the implications for the sales organization, I would say, number one, we are largely going after our existing customers. So the same large enterprises and large service providers that have been customers of F5 are the customers that want to consume us in these ELAs. So it doesn't require for our sales organization to find an entirely new set of customers. We're talking about providing a different consumption model to our existing customers. We have been preparing the sales organization for this. So it's really more about enablement and making sure that the team understands the intricacies of these commercial models and also making sure we have the right incentives in place. And so at the beginning of this year, we put some incentives in place for our sales organization to make sure that it was attractive for them to sell and market these ELAs.

Our -- also in DDoS with the introduction of our DDoS Hybrid Defender. So there's a broad range of products that we introduced actually in our Q1 that are getting strong traction. We are talking about WAF in part, because we introduced an Advanced WAF product that is very differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to extend our addressable opportunity, because it addresses a number of use cases we weren't addressing before, including things like Layer 7 DDoS with machine learning and behavioral analytics or preventing credential theft and abuse, which essentially we're the only vendor who provide these capabilities today. And so we're highlighting that introduction, but the traction is pretty broad. Overall, in terms of growth in the security space, I'd say we did expect to be growing in this area. We have said it was a strong driver, and it continues to be strong driver and will be in the second half of the year."

I would say, first of all, a majority of our software business is in the virtual edition. But a growing part of the consumption of the virtual edition is across multiple cloud, including consumptions of virtual editions in the public cloud. And so today, our customers buy virtual editions for on-prem deployment, but they also buy them to instantiate them in Amazon or Azure or Google's public clouds, and that's growing part of the software business. The other factor, which is going to be, I think, an accelerating factor in that is the introduction of our Cloud Edition today, really makes the consumption of virtual editions in the public cloud a lot easier. A, because it provides a lighter weight virtual edition to be used on a per-app basis and a lot of folks who want to deploy in the public cloud want to do it on a per-app basis. And B, because we provide a, with the Cloud Edition, a centralized orchestration mechanism that allows customers to turn virtual editions on and off or even to scale the deployment of virtual editions across multiple clouds or across on-prem in public clouds. So it's a big catalyst for virtual editions deployment across multi-clouds."

And the virtual edition is only to be used on a per-app basis. And there are very few customers who use a classic VE on a per-app basis. So I think the cannibalization will be minimal. The other aspect of that is the per-app virtual edition also allows our customers to support and put virtual editions in front of applications that traditionally would not have had them. So it's an expansion of use cases for us, including in security. Virtual -- this Cloud Edition is a great vehicle for our customers to put, for example, a Web Application Firewall in front of all their applications, which increasingly they want to do and sometimes they are required to do by regulation. So to the second point around, which customers are deploying our software, I would say, it's actually both existing and new customers. Most of our large customers are considering some form of addition of software to their existing hardware deployments. But we also have net new customers who haven't bought any hardware from F5 and are going straight to a virtual edition, either in the cloud or in their own data centers."

What -- it's actually linked to your second question. What we're seeing is key-ish both in the web application firewall market and in the DDoS market, which is where the Silverline offering has been focused, is the ability to offer both on on-prem solution and essentially an off-prem scrubbing center solution is actually key for a lot of large enterprise customers. And beyond that, the ability for us to signal from an on-prem solution to a customer that they should divert their traffic to a scrubbing center on an automated basis is absolutely a key differentiator. And that's really what Silverline brings to the table is, we have this ability to offer on-prem and off-prem solution and very strong signaling between the 2 solutions. And that's really the differentiator between us and other vendors that are either purely in the cloud DDoS or cloud WAF space or purely on the on-prem space. In terms of software and security, I think I'd have to separate those 2. In security, we compete with basically a number of players, and it really depends on the use case and the type of solution. In the space of -- in software, really, I think we have perhaps smaller competitors that have an interesting story around nimbleness and agility of deployment. But what we've seen is really the -- what the customer wants is both the agility of deployment and a depth and breadth of features to support critical applications. And I think with the Cloud Edition, we're essentially the only player that really brings both of those things to the market for the first time, and we think it's actually going to grow the addressable market for virtual ADCs."

On the on-prem versus cloud offerings for F5, I think overall, the message I'd give you is that on-prem deployment for us is still the majority of the business, though cloud deployments are growing relatively fast and certainly faster than on-prem deployment. The thing, though, for us that is the catalyst is that we're seeing, I would say, not a single one of the customers that I have spoken to in the last 6 months has articulated to me a strategy that was not a multi-cloud strategy. And so every one of our customers has plans for evolving their on-prem architectures and potentially growing their deployment and doing some things in one or multiple clouds. And a lot of time, they want to replicate their on-prem environment across multiple clouds.

So what you should see in terms of new products is -- so we did announce some of the products in our app protect portfolio and campaign in February, including the Advanced WAF.

In the second half of this year, you should see more security, new stand-alone security products in our portfolio come to market, and we'll talk about that at the right time. And then you will see, also from us, in the first half of '19 some exciting announcements, generally in the software space and cloud solutions. So I think over the next 12 months, we're bringing to market some new solutions that essentially extend our addressable market into new use cases. In the hardware space, we have released a new variant of our iSeries, I think, both at the low end and at the high end, first iSeries with 100-gig capabilities. And we're seeing quite a bit of traction with that capability coming up, because moving to 100 gig in data centers is not just in our ADC category, but across a number of other categories. That's a hot topic at the moment. So that's the -- that's what's ahead. Well, your Second question was about share gains in virtual ADC and hardware. On that topic, I think what we've said at our AIM conference really stands in that. We feel that overall, our hardware business, if you look at 2018, we expect that to decline in the low single digit to flat. I think overall, based on what we see as market forecast, we will gain share, because the expectation is that market is declining at mid-single digits. And the reason I feel pretty good about that share gain is because I feel good about our position with service providers. I feel very good about the use cases that the iSeries is enabling and the breadth of use cases that we can attack. And I feel very good about the conversation we're having with customers having made their decisions on architecture. So I think I stand by what we said at AIM. In the case of the virtual ADC space, it's more of a nascent space, but growing fast. And I think if we maintain the growth rate that you've been seeing for the first half of the year, we clearly will be gaining share in that market."

Look, if you recall, George, in the -- I think it was in our Q4 -- at the end of our Q4 in the October earnings call, we shared at the time that we felt pretty good that we would return to product revenue growth in 2018. And at that time, we said the reasons were: number one, we had put the number of initiatives in -- with our sales organization in terms of some restructuring and some better alignment of our teams against some opportunities. And I feel John and his team have been executing very well against these initiatives, and we're seeing that. Number two, we were also expecting to see traction with some new offerings we had put in place, including ELAs and subscriptions. And we are actually seeing that, and that's contributing. And then number three, the offerings that you're hearing, iSeries -- what we've done on the iSeries and the refresh, some of these new security offerings that we've put in place, all of these are catalysts for enhancement in product revenue growth. And we now have better line of sight to this than we did 6 months ago. So all of the above are actually contributing, frankly, in line with what we felt would happen throughout the year."

And our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit.",643,"Thank you, Jason. Q2 was a quarter of solid execution. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures. And our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Second quarter revenue of $533 million, up 3% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $525 million to $535 million. GAAP EPS of $1.77 per share was above our guidance of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.31 per share was also above our guidance of $2.24 to $2.27 per share.
Product revenue of $238 million in the second quarter was down 1% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Software in Q2 was 15% of product revenue and was up 28% year-over-year. Systems revenue declined 5% year-over-year and made up 85% of product revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 26% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, grew 2% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 6% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%. And government sales were 13%, including 5% from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 17% of total revenue. Tech Data accounted for 12%. And Arrow, Cynics and Westcon each accounted for 11% of revenue.
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses of $300 million were within our $296 million to $306 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $264 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.9%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $185 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.4 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.7% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,385 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $140.82 per share for a total of $150 million.
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q3. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see momentum building in the business as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We expect further improvement in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter, highlighted by a return to year-over-year product revenue growth. With this in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $535 million to $545 million. We expect the GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. 
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $297 million to $307 million, including approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect the GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the third quarter and the non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. And our Q3 GAAP earnings target is $1.79 to $1.82 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the second quarter, we saw momentum across the business. Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by deployments in the public cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environment. 
We saw strong demand for our security solutions at our enterprise customers as they embrace our Web Application Firewall, identity and access management and SSL capabilities. 
Our Services business had another solid quarter, with revenue up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margins above 86%. This group provides customer support that is unmatched by any of our competitors, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction and stickiness.  The value of our services capabilities only grows, as complexities associated with multi-cloud deployment impact more customers. 
We have strong execution during the second quarter, and we are encouraged by the underlying trends as we move into the second half of fiscal 2018. Our software solutions are gaining traction across deployment environments, with strength in public cloud, bring your own license and utility-based consumption.
We saw good customer interest in our recently introduced consumption models, particularly Enterprise License Agreements. The ability to offer more flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions is enabling more strategic conversations with customers, allowing us to reach a broader set of buyers. 
During the quarter, we closed several meaningful ELAs, including a transaction with a U.S.-based communication services company, which also included a hardware refresh and service renewal. Through an ELA structure for our virtual editions, we were able to meet the customer's need for enabling speed-to-market for their applications and frictionless movement between cloud providers, as they aggressively roll out a multi-cloud strategy. 
Our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial technology provider helped us replace an incumbent WAF vendor in an account where we were not historically the primary ADC or WAF. Key to winning this deal was the breadth of our WAF functionality, the flexibility for enabling speed-to-market for application services provisioning and the ability for our virtual editions to interact with our Silverline WAF and DDoS services. In both transactions, our ability to structure ELAs drove larger overall opportunities for F5. 
The traction we are seeing in software will be further enhanced by the introduction of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially announced earlier today. This release allows us to better reach the next tier of applications within our existing customers through improvements in usability and comprehensive per-app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution gives customers a lightweight option when developing, deploying and securing all applications at every step in the testing and production pipeline, including use cases designed around public and private clouds.
Security is a critical component of an increasing number of our customer interactions. We saw good momentum in our WAF offerings, which delivered a solid year-over-year growth during Q2. We also saw growing customer interest in our identity and SSL solutions targeted at enterprise accounts. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a U.S. government agency driven by the performance of our BIG-IP appliances with our WAF modules. A key differentiation in this deal was our ability to scale well in excess of the competition to meet the customer's need to protect over 100 global Web-based applications.
Our industry-leading WAF portfolio takes another meaningful step ahead of the competition with the availability of our advanced WAF offering, an important component of our stand-alone security strategy. We have customized the form factor, features and user interface in way that enables security teams to focus on getting the information they need to know when they need to know it. 
As we outlined in March, we see additions to our security portfolio over the course of 2018, opening substantial new addressable opportunity. Core enhancements with Advanced WAF include bug detection beyond signatures and repetition to block evolving automated attacks, application-layer encryption to protect against credential theft and DDoS detection using machine learning and behavioral analytics at Layer 7. Advanced WAF supports a variety of consumption and licensing models, including a per-app, perpetual, subscription and utility billing. 
We are already seeing strong customer interest in the differentiated capabilities provided by our Advanced WAF, which is evident in a deal we won during the second quarter at a large African stock exchange, where our behavioral DDoS capabilities, in-browser encryption and ability to integrate with our Silverline offering allowed us to stand out from traditional WAF vendors and cloud-native solutions. In a situation where the customer is migrating workloads to a multi-cloud environment, the ability to centralize critical security services and the cost savings versus individual cloud provider offerings resonated with the customer. 
From an organizational perspective, we are excited to announce Frank Pelzer has agreed to join the F5 team as our new CFO starting on May 21. Frank brings to F5 tremendous software and cloud experience, most recently as the President and COO of the Cloud Business Group at SAP. Previously, he was CFO at Concur Technologies, a leading publicly traded cloud-based travel and expense management solution that was purchased by SAP in 2014.  Frank's background makes him an ideal fit for the next phase of F5's growth. 
We also announced today that John DiLullo, our EVP of Worldwide Sales, will be leaving the company in May to pursue other opportunities. Steve McMillan, our Head of Global Services, will oversee the sales organization while we undertake a full search to find John's permanent successor. In John's time at F5, he led a restructuring of F5's sales organization, including evolving our channel program to better address cloud enablement partners and security opportunities. With a strong set of theater leads now in place, the organization is structured for success, as is evident in our improved execution over the past several quarters. 
As we outlined at our March Analyst and Investor Meeting, we are evolving from an ADC company to a multi-cloud application service company that will reach every app anywhere. Our conviction that multi-cloud application services will define the next phase of F5's growth is only bolstered by my conversations with our customers. Having spent time with dozens of vendors past year in every theater and across a diverse set of industries, not one of them believes the complexities they are facing in managing their apps across multiple clouds can be solved by a single generalist cloud provider. They require a focused player who understands the intricacies of enterprise applications. 
While we have meaningful work ahead of us to achieve the goals we outlined in early March, I am pleased with our execution over the past several quarters, both in delivering to the near-term financial targets we have laid out and with the progress in prioritizing and accelerating efforts in product development and go-to-market. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we see momentum both in terms of growing our product revenue and in continuing to deliver strong profitability and cash generation. We are focused on executing to the long-term strategy that we outlined in March, and we look forward to updating you on our continued -- on continued progress over the coming quarters. 
Finally, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the second quarter. In particular, I want to thank, Andy for his contributions over the past 20 years, as he will be retiring from F5 in May. Andy was a key part of growing F5 into the $2 billion annual business it is today, instilling the structure and discipline that helped drive our enviable margins and cash generations. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year, and I know I speak for everyone at F5 in wishing him nothing but happiness and success in his future endeavors.
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I'll start with the latter part. The -- I think what we've seen last year is a number of customers, who are considering or reconsidering their architecture, especially looking to move towards a multi-cloud environment and trying to figure out how much they would deploy in hardware, how much they would deploy in software, what would be in public cloud and private clouds and so forth. I think we talked about it last year, saying the decision cycle in some cases was causing some pause in their decision-making. I think to a certain extent, that still exists and we still see that dynamic in the marketplace. But I think we see also a number of customers that have kind of made their decisions on their architecture, and therefore, they're moving forward on their decisions. And whether it's ELAs in software or some hardware deployments, they're just moving forward. So I think that's the dynamic we're seeing in the market. I think in a number of cases, we also see customers, who have waited to make these decisions, but application traffic and the pressures on traffic kind of catches up with them. And at some point, they have to move forward and make their decisions. So that's a dynamic in the market. In terms of ELAs, Jason, we're -- that's an offering that's only been in the market for us for really only a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased with the traction that we're seeing with this mode of consumption. It just gives a lot more flexibility to our customers to deploy our technologies in a frictionless way across on-prem or public cloud. And the -- both the initial traction and the initial deals that we're seeing are in fact pretty chunky."

In terms of the implications for the sales organization, I would say, number one, we are largely going after our existing customers. So the same large enterprises and large service providers that have been customers of F5 are the customers that want to consume us in these ELAs. So it doesn't require for our sales organization to find an entirely new set of customers. We're talking about providing a different consumption model to our existing customers. We have been preparing the sales organization for this. So it's really more about enablement and making sure that the team understands the intricacies of these commercial models and also making sure we have the right incentives in place. And so at the beginning of this year, we put some incentives in place for our sales organization to make sure that it was attractive for them to sell and market these ELAs.

Our -- also in DDoS with the introduction of our DDoS Hybrid Defender. So there's a broad range of products that we introduced actually in our Q1 that are getting strong traction. We are talking about WAF in part, because we introduced an Advanced WAF product that is very differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to extend our addressable opportunity, because it addresses a number of use cases we weren't addressing before, including things like Layer 7 DDoS with machine learning and behavioral analytics or preventing credential theft and abuse, which essentially we're the only vendor who provide these capabilities today. And so we're highlighting that introduction, but the traction is pretty broad. Overall, in terms of growth in the security space, I'd say we did expect to be growing in this area. We have said it was a strong driver, and it continues to be strong driver and will be in the second half of the year."

I would say, first of all, a majority of our software business is in the virtual edition. But a growing part of the consumption of the virtual edition is across multiple cloud, including consumptions of virtual editions in the public cloud. And so today, our customers buy virtual editions for on-prem deployment, but they also buy them to instantiate them in Amazon or Azure or Google's public clouds, and that's growing part of the software business. The other factor, which is going to be, I think, an accelerating factor in that is the introduction of our Cloud Edition today, really makes the consumption of virtual editions in the public cloud a lot easier. A, because it provides a lighter weight virtual edition to be used on a per-app basis and a lot of folks who want to deploy in the public cloud want to do it on a per-app basis. And B, because we provide a, with the Cloud Edition, a centralized orchestration mechanism that allows customers to turn virtual editions on and off or even to scale the deployment of virtual editions across multiple clouds or across on-prem in public clouds. So it's a big catalyst for virtual editions deployment across multi-clouds."

And the virtual edition is only to be used on a per-app basis. And there are very few customers who use a classic VE on a per-app basis. So I think the cannibalization will be minimal. The other aspect of that is the per-app virtual edition also allows our customers to support and put virtual editions in front of applications that traditionally would not have had them. So it's an expansion of use cases for us, including in security. Virtual -- this Cloud Edition is a great vehicle for our customers to put, for example, a Web Application Firewall in front of all their applications, which increasingly they want to do and sometimes they are required to do by regulation. So to the second point around, which customers are deploying our software, I would say, it's actually both existing and new customers. Most of our large customers are considering some form of addition of software to their existing hardware deployments. But we also have net new customers who haven't bought any hardware from F5 and are going straight to a virtual edition, either in the cloud or in their own data centers."

What -- it's actually linked to your second question. What we're seeing is key-ish both in the web application firewall market and in the DDoS market, which is where the Silverline offering has been focused, is the ability to offer both an on-prem solution and essentially an off-prem scrubbing center solution is actually key for a lot of large enterprise customers. And beyond that, the ability for us to signal from an on-prem solution to a customer that they should divert their traffic to a scrubbing center on an automated basis is absolutely a key differentiator. And that's really what Silverline brings to the table is, we have this ability to offer on-prem and off-prem solution and very strong signaling between the 2 solutions. And that's really the differentiator between us and other vendors that are either purely in the cloud DDoS or cloud WAF space or purely on the on-prem space. In terms of software and security, I think I'd have to separate those 2. In security, we compete with basically a number of players, and it really depends on the use case and the type of solution. In the space of -- in software, really, I think we have perhaps smaller competitors that have an interesting story around nimbleness and agility of deployment. But what we've seen is really the -- what the customer wants is both the agility of deployment and a depth and breadth of features to support critical applications. And I think with the Cloud Edition, we're essentially the only player that really brings both of those things to the market for the first time, and we think it's actually going to grow the addressable market for virtual ADCs."

On the on-prem versus cloud offerings for F5, I think overall, the message I'd give you is that on-prem deployment for us is still the majority of the business, though cloud deployments are growing relatively fast and certainly faster than on-prem deployment. The thing, though, for us that is the catalyst is that we're seeing, I would say, not a single one of the customers that I have spoken to in the last 6 months has articulated to me a strategy that was not a multi-cloud strategy. And so every one of our customers has plans for evolving their on-prem architectures and potentially growing their deployment and doing some things in one or multiple clouds. And a lot of time, they want to replicate their on-prem environment across multiple clouds.

So what you should see in terms of new products is -- so we did announce some of the products in our app protect portfolio and campaign in February, including the Advanced WAF. We are going to release the Cloud Edition at the end of May this year. In the second half of this year, you should see more security, new stand-alone security products in our portfolio come to market, and we'll talk about that at the right time. And then you will see, also from us, in the first half of '19 some exciting announcements, generally in the software space and cloud solutions. So I think over the next 12 months, we're bringing to market some new solutions that essentially extend our addressable market into new use cases. In the hardware space, we have released a new variant of our iSeries, I think, both at the low end and at the high end, first iSeries with 100-gig capabilities. And we're seeing quite a bit of traction with that capability coming up, because moving to 100 gig in data centers is not just in our ADC category, but across a number of other categories. That's a hot topic at the moment. So that's the -- that's what's ahead. Well, your second question was about share gains in virtual ADC and hardware. On that topic, I think what we've said at our AIM conference really stands in that. We feel that overall, our hardware business, if you look at 2018, we expect that to decline in the low single digit to flat. I think overall, based on what we see as market forecast, we will gain share, because the expectation is that market is declining at mid-single digits. And the reason I feel pretty good about that share gain is because I feel good about our position with service providers. I feel very good about the use cases that the iSeries is enabling and the breadth of use cases that we can attack. And I feel very good about the conversation we're having with customers having made their decisions on architecture. So I think I stand by what we said at AIM. In the case of the virtual ADC space, it's more of a nascent space, but growing fast. And I think if we maintain the growth rate that you've been seeing for the first half of the year, we clearly will be gaining share in that market."

We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures. And our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit.",643,"Thank you, Jason. Q2 was a quarter of solid execution. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures. And our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Second quarter revenue of $533 million, up 3% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $525 million to $535 million. GAAP EPS of $1.77 per share was above our guidance of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.31 per share was also above our guidance of $2.24 to $2.27 per share.
Product revenue of $238 million in the second quarter was down 1% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Software in Q2 was 15% of product revenue and was up 28% year-over-year. Systems revenue declined 5% year-over-year and made up 85% of product revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.
On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 26% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, grew 2% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 6% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%. And government sales were 13%, including 5% from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 17% of total revenue. Tech Data accounted for 12%. And Arrow, Cynics and Westcon each accounted for 11% of revenue.
Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses of $300 million were within our $296 million to $306 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $264 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.9%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $185 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.4 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.7% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,385 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $140.82 per share for a total of $150 million.
Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q3. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see momentum building in the business as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We expect further improvement in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter, highlighted by a return to year-over-year product revenue growth. With this in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal '18, we are targeting revenue in a range of $535 million to $545 million. We expect the GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. 
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $297 million to $307 million, including approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect the GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the third quarter and the non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. And our Q3 GAAP earnings target is $1.79 to $1.82 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the second quarter, we saw momentum across the business. Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by deployments in the public cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environment. 
We saw strong demand for our security solutions at our enterprise customers as they embrace our Web Application Firewall, identity and access management and SSL capabilities. 
Our Services business had another solid quarter, with revenue up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margins above 86%. This group provides customer support that is unmatched by any of our competitors, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction and stickiness.  The value of our services capabilities only grows, as complexities associated with multi-cloud deployment impact more customers. 
We have strong execution during the second quarter, and we are encouraged by the underlying trends as we move into the second half of fiscal 2018. Our software solutions are gaining traction across deployment environments, with strength in public cloud, bring your own license and utility-based consumption.
We saw good customer interest in our recently introduced consumption models, particularly Enterprise License Agreements. The ability to offer more flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions is enabling more strategic conversations with customers, allowing us to reach a broader set of buyers. 
During the quarter, we closed several meaningful ELAs, including a transaction with a U.S.-based communication services company, which also included a hardware refresh and service renewal. Through an ELA structure for our virtual editions, we were able to meet the customer's need for enabling speed-to-market for their applications and frictionless movement between cloud providers, as they aggressively roll out a multi-cloud strategy. 
Our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial technology provider helped us replace an incumbent WAF vendor in an account where we were not historically the primary ADC or WAF. Key to winning this deal was the breadth of our WAF functionality, the flexibility for enabling speed-to-market for application services provisioning and the ability for our virtual editions to interact with our Silverline WAF and DDoS services. In both transactions, our ability to structure ELAs drove larger overall opportunities for F5. 
The traction we are seeing in software will be further enhanced by the introduction of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially announced earlier today. This release allows us to better reach the next tier of applications within our existing customers through improvements in usability and comprehensive per-app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution gives customers a lightweight option when developing, deploying and securing all applications at every step in the testing and production pipeline, including use cases designed around public and private clouds.
Security is a critical component of an increasing number of our customer interactions. We saw good momentum in our WAF offerings, which delivered a solid year-over-year growth during Q2. We also saw growing customer interest in our identity and SSL solutions targeted at enterprise accounts. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a U.S. government agency driven by the performance of our BIG-IP appliances with our WAF modules. A key differentiation in this deal was our ability to scale well in excess of the competition to meet the customer's need to protect over 100 global Web-based applications.
Our industry-leading WAF portfolio takes another meaningful step ahead of the competition with the availability of our advanced WAF offering, an important component of our stand-alone security strategy. We have customized the form factor, features and user interface in way that enables security teams to focus on getting the information they need to know when they need to know it. 
As we outlined in March, we see additions to our security portfolio over the course of 2018, opening substantial new addressable opportunity. Core enhancements with Advanced WAF include bug detection beyond signatures and repetition to block evolving automated attacks, application-layer encryption to protect against credential theft and DDoS detection using machine learning and behavioral analytics at Layer 7. Advanced WAF supports a variety of consumption and licensing models, including a per-app, perpetual, subscription and utility billing. 
We are already seeing strong customer interest in the differentiated capabilities provided by our Advanced WAF, which is evident in a deal we won during the second quarter at a large African stock exchange, where our behavioral DDoS capabilities, in-browser encryption and ability to integrate with our Silverline offering allowed us to stand out from traditional WAF vendors and cloud-native solutions. In a situation where the customer is migrating workloads to a multi-cloud environment, the ability to centralize critical security services and the cost savings versus individual cloud provider offerings resonated with the customer. 
From an organizational perspective, we are excited to announce Frank Pelzer has agreed to join the F5 team as our new CFO starting on May 21. Frank brings to F5 tremendous software and cloud experience, most recently as the President and COO of the Cloud Business Group at SAP. Previously, he was CFO at Concur Technologies, a leading publicly traded cloud-based travel and expense management solution that was purchased by SAP in 2014.  Frank's background makes him an ideal fit for the next phase of F5's growth. 
We also announced today that John DiLullo, our EVP of Worldwide Sales, will be leaving the company in May to pursue other opportunities. Steve McMillan, our Head of Global Services, will oversee the sales organization while we undertake a full search to find John's permanent successor. In John's time at F5, he led a restructuring of F5's sales organization, including evolving our channel program to better address cloud enablement partners and security opportunities. With a strong set of theater leads now in place, the organization is structured for success, as is evident in our improved execution over the past several quarters. 
As we outlined at our March Analyst and Investor Meeting, we are evolving from an ADC company to a multi-cloud application service company that will reach every app anywhere. Our conviction that multi-cloud application services will define the next phase of F5's growth is only bolstered by my conversations with our customers. Having spent time with dozens of vendors past year in every theater and across a diverse set of industries, not one of them believes the complexities they are facing in managing their apps across multiple clouds can be solved by a single generalist cloud provider. They require a focused player who understands the intricacies of enterprise applications. 
While we have meaningful work ahead of us to achieve the goals we outlined in early March, I am pleased with our execution over the past several quarters, both in delivering to the near-term financial targets we have laid out and with the progress in prioritizing and accelerating efforts in product development and go-to-market. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we see momentum both in terms of growing our product revenue and in continuing to deliver strong profitability and cash generation. We are focused on executing to the long-term strategy that we outlined in March, and we look forward to updating you on our continued -- on continued progress over the coming quarters. 
Finally, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the second quarter. In particular, I want to thank, Andy for his contributions over the past 20 years, as he will be retiring from F5 in May. Andy was a key part of growing F5 into the $2 billion annual business it is today, instilling the structure and discipline that helped drive our enviable margins and cash generations. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year, and I know I speak for everyone at F5 in wishing him nothing but happiness and success in his future endeavors.
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I'll start with the latter part. The -- I think what we've seen last year is a number of customers, who are considering or reconsidering their architecture, especially looking to move towards a multi-cloud environment and trying to figure out how much they would deploy in hardware, how much they would deploy in software, what would be in public cloud and private clouds and so forth. I think we talked about it last year, saying the decision cycle in some cases was causing some pause in their decision-making. I think to a certain extent, that still exists and we still see that dynamic in the marketplace. But I think we see also a number of customers that have kind of made their decisions on their architecture, and therefore, they're moving forward on their decisions. And whether it's ELAs in software or some hardware deployments, they're just moving forward. So I think that's the dynamic we're seeing in the market. I think in a number of cases, we also see customers, who have waited to make these decisions, but application traffic and the pressures on traffic kind of catches up with them. And at some point, they have to move forward and make their decisions. So that's a dynamic in the market. In terms of ELAs, Jason, we're -- that's an offering that's only been in the market for us for really only a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased with the traction that we're seeing with this mode of consumption. It just gives a lot more flexibility to our customers to deploy our technologies in a frictionless way across on-prem or public cloud. And the -- both the initial traction and the initial deals that we're seeing are in fact pretty chunky."

In terms of the implications for the sales organization, I would say, number one, we are largely going after our existing customers. So the same large enterprises and large service providers that have been customers of F5 are the customers that want to consume us in these ELAs. So it doesn't require for our sales organization to find an entirely new set of customers. We're talking about providing a different consumption model to our existing customers. We have been preparing the sales organization for this. So it's really more about enablement and making sure that the team understands the intricacies of these commercial models and also making sure we have the right incentives in place. And so at the beginning of this year, we put some incentives in place for our sales organization to make sure that it was attractive for them to sell and market these ELAs.

Our -- also in DDoS with the introduction of our DDoS Hybrid Defender. So there's a broad range of products that we introduced actually in our Q1 that are getting strong traction. We are talking about WAF in part, because we introduced an Advanced WAF product that is very differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to extend our addressable opportunity, because it addresses a number of use cases we weren't addressing before, including things like Layer 7 DDoS with machine learning and behavioral analytics or preventing credential theft and abuse, which essentially we're the only vendor who provide these capabilities today. And so we're highlighting that introduction, but the traction is pretty broad. Overall, in terms of growth in the security space, I'd say we did expect to be growing in this area. We have said it was a strong driver, and it continues to be strong driver and will be in the second half of the year."

I would say, first of all, a majority of our software business is in the virtual edition. But a growing part of the consumption of the virtual edition is across multiple cloud, including consumptions of virtual editions in the public cloud. And so today, our customers buy virtual editions for on-prem deployment, but they also buy them to instantiate them in Amazon or Azure or Google's public clouds, and that's growing part of the software business. The other factor, which is going to be, I think, an accelerating factor in that is the introduction of our Cloud Edition today, really makes the consumption of virtual editions in the public cloud a lot easier. A, because it provides a lighter weight virtual edition to be used on a per-app basis and a lot of folks who want to deploy in the public cloud want to do it on a per-app basis. And B, because we provide a, with the Cloud Edition, a centralized orchestration mechanism that allows customers to turn virtual editions on and off or even to scale the deployment of virtual editions across multiple clouds or across on-prem in public clouds. So it's a big catalyst for virtual editions deployment across multi-clouds."

And the virtual edition is only to be used on a per-app basis. And there are very few customers who use a classic VE on a per-app basis. So I think the cannibalization will be minimal. The other aspect of that is the per-app virtual edition also allows our customers to support and put virtual editions in front of applications that traditionally would not have had them. So it's an expansion of use cases for us, including in security. Virtual -- this Cloud Edition is a great vehicle for our customers to put, for example, a Web Application Firewall in front of all their applications, which increasingly they want to do and sometimes they are required to do by regulation. So to the second point around, which customers are deploying our software, I would say, it's actually both existing and new customers. Most of our large customers are considering some form of addition of software to their existing hardware deployments. But we also have net new customers who haven't bought any hardware from F5 and are going straight to a virtual edition, either in the cloud or in their own data centers."

What -- it's actually linked to your second question. What we're seeing is key-ish both in the web application firewall market and in the DDoS market, which is where the Silverline offering has been focused, is the ability to offer both an on-prem solution and essentially an off-prem scrubbing center solution is actually key for a lot of large enterprise customers. And beyond that, the ability for us to signal from an on-prem solution to a customer that they should divert their traffic to a scrubbing center on an automated basis is absolutely a key differentiator. And that's really what Silverline brings to the table is, we have this ability to offer on-prem and off-prem solution and very strong signaling between the 2 solutions. And that's really the differentiator between us and other vendors that are either purely in the cloud DDoS or cloud WAF space or purely on the on-prem space. In terms of software and security, I think I'd have to separate those 2. In security, we compete with basically a number of players, and it really depends on the use case and the type of solution. In the space of -- in software, really, I think we have perhaps smaller competitors that have an interesting story around nimbleness and agility of deployment. But what we've seen is really the -- what the customer wants is both the agility of deployment and a depth and breadth of features to support critical applications. And I think with the Cloud Edition, we're essentially the only player that really brings both of those things to the market for the first time, and we think it's actually going to grow the addressable market for virtual ADCs."

On the on-prem versus cloud offerings for F5, I think overall, the message I'd give you is that on-prem deployment for us is still the majority of the business, though cloud deployments are growing relatively fast and certainly faster than on-prem deployment. The thing, though, for us that is the catalyst is that we're seeing, I would say, not a single one of the customers that I have spoken to in the last 6 months has articulated to me a strategy that was not a multi-cloud strategy. And so every one of our customers has plans for evolving their on-prem architectures and potentially growing their deployment and doing some things in one or multiple clouds. And a lot of time, they want to replicate their on-prem environment across multiple clouds. That's a big driver for us, because we're, I think, uniquely positioned as a vendor that supports both across their journey. Andy?"

So what you should see in terms of new products is -- so we did announce some of the products in our app protect portfolio and campaign in February, including the Advanced WAF. We are going to release the Cloud Edition at the end of May this year. In the second half of this year, you should see more security, new stand-alone security products in our portfolio come to market, and we'll talk about that at the right time. And then you will see, also from us, in the first half of '19 some exciting announcements, generally in the software space and cloud solutions. So I think over the next 12 months, we're bringing to market some new solutions that essentially extend our addressable market into new use cases. In the hardware space, we have released a new variant of our iSeries, I think, both at the low end and at the high end, first iSeries with 100-gig capabilities. And we're seeing quite a bit of traction with that capability coming up, because moving to 100 gig in data centers is not just in our ADC category, but across a number of other categories. That's a hot topic at the moment. So that's the -- that's what's ahead. Well, your second question was about share gains in virtual ADC and hardware. On that topic, I think what we've said at our AIM conference really stands in that. We feel that overall, our hardware business, if you look at 2018, we expect that to decline in the low single digit to flat. I think overall, based on what we see as market forecast, we will gain share, because the expectation is that market is declining at mid-single digits. And the reason I feel pretty good about that share gain is because I feel good about our position with service providers. I feel very good about the use cases that the iSeries is enabling and the breadth of use cases that we can attack. And I feel very good about the conversation we're having with customers having made their decisions on architecture. So I think I stand by what we said at AIM. In the case of the virtual ADC space, it's more of a nascent space, but growing fast. And I think if we maintain the growth rate that you've been seeing for the first half of the year, we clearly will be gaining share in that market."

My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today, our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. 
Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million.
GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. This peak was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and the lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year.
Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue, grew 4% from year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue, and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue. Centex Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11% and Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.
I will now discuss our operating results. 
GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5% in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower-than-expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results.
We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by a build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.
Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. 
In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $166.22 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Now let me discuss our guidance for Q4. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see continuing momentum in the business as we close out the fiscal year. We expect to deliver another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued strength in product revenue. 
For the quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million. Today, we announced an initiative to further align spend with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we will be accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest growing areas of our business, cloud and security. As a result, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of $23 million to $25 million in Q4, that is reflected in our GAAP expense estimate.  We do not anticipate that this action will impact our Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 financial guidance that we laid out for you in March. 
In Q4, we expect GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%, including $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $317 million to $329 million, including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million to $25 million in restructuring expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and the non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. 
Our Q4 GAAP earnings target is $1.77 to $1.88 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.61 to $2.64 per share. 
On a final topic, I'm happy to report that my first few months as F5 CFO have gone very smoothly. I've had the opportunity to work with all areas and levels in the business and have been very impressed by the high quality and depth of knowledge of all F5 employees, particularly our world-class finance and accounting team.
I would like to thank, everyone for their warm acceptance of me to the organization and their tireless efforts in building a fantastic business. 
With that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth. Software revenue continues to expand driven by deployments in public and private cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environment. We also saw strong demand for our security solutions, protecting enterprise customers that gave application-based threats. 
Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 24% year-over-year. The pace of ELA and BEA subscription software deals accelerated in Q3, as customers continued to embrace flexible consumption models, a trend we think will be important in driving adoption of our new cloud offerings, including our recently introduced BIG-IP Cloud Edition.
While cloud edition was just released to market at the end of May, we are already seeing strong interest and pipeline across the theaters. The early feedback from customers, who purchased the product in Q3, confirms our view that right sized application services for every app opens up a large set of used cases that were not previously well addressed by existing software ADC offerings. We expect momentum for Cloud Edition to continue to build and that it will be a meaningful driver of software growth in FY '19 and beyond.
In addition, we are seeing our customers increasingly choose to deploy a blend of both iSeries system along with software in multi-cloud environment. Customers continue to utilize F5 security, application services and orchestration to seamlessly manage workloads across these hybrid environments. 
Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and deferred revenue of $1 billion. This team provides unparalleled customer support, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction. The value of our services capabilities will only grow, as the complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments become more prominent with our customers. 
We've shown strong execution during the third quarter for software solutions across all deployment environments with strength in public cloud, both in bring your license and utility-based consumption. We also saw a continued sequential growth for enterprise license agreements and subscription offerings. These offerings provide flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual edition, leading to software expansion in-service provider enterprise accounts.
For instance, our ability to structure and ELA at a large U.S. financial services company help create a high-capacity DNS infrastructure. The policy-based DNS functionality provides resiliency against outrages across regional hubs. The deployment works across the 3 major clouds, allowing the customer to choose the right cloud provider for the task at hand. This CLA is part of multi-cloud software infrastructure and the customer continues to buy hardware systems to support a hybrid environment.
The traction we are seeing in software is augmented with the early success of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially launched on May 31. As a reminder, this release improved per app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution provides app owners a virtual application delivery controller that can apply and automate policy when developing, deploying and securing applications across public and private clouds. 
A large online services company in Asia purchased Cloud Edition to automate application deployment and shorten scale out time. Utilizing BIG-IP functionality paired with Cloud Edition, the customer was able to auto scale instances at the app level with analytics and seamless interoperability with other F5 solutions. 
Application protection continues to be a driver of security solutions with good momentum in our WAF offerings. A leading independent research firm identified F5 as a WAF leader with multiple consumption models, including a traditional application security manager, Advanced web application firewall and Silverline managed service. In the first full quarter of sale, advanced graph showing strong adoption from both new and existing customers. The operational use of configuration and deployment is attracting new stand-alone security buyers. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at the European web hosting company, driven by our Advanced Web Application Firewall.
The customer deployed advanced WAF to protect their website portals and safeguard their brand reputation from application-level compromise by sophisticated Layer 7 DDoS attacks. 
The sales team participated in a competitive evaluation and demonstrated protection from bot-based attacks and superior behavior-based protection to catch subtle application layer DDoS attempts.
Highlighting our stated objective of offering stand-alone security products to a security buyer. Today, we are introducing F5 SSL Orchestrator. This dedicated security solution allows ease of deployment and configuration for enterprise customers that demand orchestration with high performance subscription, encryption and steering of SSL traffic. This product gives customers a security appliance, offering dynamic service across the security infrastructure. 
Consistent with our approach presented in our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, we will continue to expand our stand-alone security portfolio. And today, we also announced the availability of F5 Access Manager. 
Core enhancements include protection of sensitive data with adaptive authentication, while providing access for authorized users, devices and APIs, guarding against pervasive threads, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Access Manager enables organization to bridge on-prem app functionality to the cloud, effectively integrating with identity of the service solutions to support evolving, heterogeneous environments.
As we outlined over the past year, we are evolving to a multi-cloud application services company that will reach every app anywhere. With this in mind, we are realigning resources to better position F5 for 2019 and beyond. 
Today, we are taking steps to notify some employees that their roles are under consideration or will be eliminated in order to accelerate or hiring in geographic sales expansion, new sales go-to-market motions, multi-cloud software development and digital transformation initiatives. 
Our objective with these decisions is to further align our workforce with a long-term strategy and accelerate the transformation that we outlined in our Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this year.
The long-term vision set forth is seeing significant traction with continued momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environment and they deploy incremental workloads dynamically, both on-premise and in cloud environment. The expansion of our software asset portfolio and stand-alone security products positions us as the leader in multi-cloud application services.
Before moving on to the question-and-answer session, I wanted to highlight 3 key additions to the leadership team. First, I am excited to announce that Chad Whalen has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Chad joined F5 18 months ago, and has built up our cloud sales team, while significantly deepening our partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Chad also bought to F5 a depth of experience that spans complex, large enterprises to fast-moving startups. His past leadership roles included Fortunate, Worldwide Package, Jasper and Sienna. Chad brings a combination of cloud, security, IoT and service provider expertise that we will leverage in our transformation to become a multi-cloud application services leader.
We were also pleased to announce on July 11, that Mary Gartner joined the F5 team as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Mary is a seasoned security leader with extensive experience in the health and finance sectors, where the protection of highly sensitive customer data and compliance with stringent regulations are business-critical issues. 
Prior to F5, Mary has held security leadership roles at Seattle Children's Hospital, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and kept information and networks safe at Port of Seattle and Washington Mutual, JP Morgan Chase. 
Another important addition to our leadership team is James who joined this month as General Manager for our Service Provider Business. James comes to us with 14 years of where he held multiple leadership roles supporting the design and operation of their network architecture, including his most recent role as Vice President of Network Virtualization.
His hands-on insight into the challenges and opportunities service providers phase, as they rollout 5G, SSL and IoT services will be invaluable to F5 as we expanding our reach and role in these environments. 
I would like to welcome Chad, Mary and James to their roles on the F5 leadership team. 
As always, I would like to thank the entire time F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the third quarter. 
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

Well, the first thing I would say about the restructuring is that, I genuinely don't like having to make these decisions, because ideally and philosophically, we would like to embark every employee that's been part of the F5 into this exciting future that we're building with this company. And our Executive team has taken into immense consideration onto this because we know that we are making decision that impact the lives of many of our colleagues and friends. That being said, we are very focused on the transformation of F5 into a multi-cloud application services leader. And as a result, there is legacy spend that we have that is less relevant to the future than it has been for the past. And we are shifting our focus to the growth areas of F5. And specifically, we are intensifying our investments into software and multi-cloud technologies, in new go-to-market motion and also in building the necessary digital infrastructure that enables those go-to-market motions. And so today's restructuring is really not about cost cutting, it really is about real realignment of resources towards these areas and accelerating the execution of our strategy. In terms of how you should think about this action as it relates to long-term financial model. It's all very consistent with what we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, and so this action has no implied change in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 guidance, so this is FY '19 and also '21, '22."

I've said that, I consider acquisitions to be potential tool in the execution of our strategy as a technology company. If and when we find investment opportunity that makes sense, we will execute on that. And the key for me is that we'll continue to be disciplined in our investments, whether they be investments in organic innovation or potential investments in inorganic innovation in the future that we think is a very disciplined approach to both. And that's what you're seeing in our actions today. In terms of the tractions that we're getting with our new stand-alone security offerings, we don't disclose customer accounts, but I can tell you that the new stand-alone security solutions that we have announced, we have already won number of customers in those, including a number of customers that are net new customers to F5. And the thing that for me is a significant sign of traction we are getting there is number of deals we are willing with our SSL orchestration solutions or our advanced WAF solutions. We are not competing with any ADC vendors. We really are only competing with traditional or next-generation security vendors. And our win rate is very strong. A good example of that is, if you take our SSL Orchestration solution, we just released, it really is a use case that is absolutely, critical to the security infrastructure, largely because most of the traffic now is encrypted. So the traditional security appliances are not very efficient at doing this encryption, decryption work in addition to security service they have to offer. And so, in this case, actually, F5's hardware -- security hardware is extremely efficient in encryption and decryption and we marry that with an intelligent policy-based training of security services. And that allows us to provide a service chain across the full security stack, and really nobody else can do that. So that is a great use case for how security solutions are outperforming. And it is absolutely, in line with our strategy to be the leader in application security."

Public cloud is actually the fastest-growing part of our business.

I'm sure that we're now billing millions of hours per quarter on all the major public clouds.

So that we can understand either may be what proportion of product revenue the software sales are? Or some other KPI that you have got in mind that would help us track actual quantifiable progress on that strategy. So that's, I guess, one question. Another one is related to that, which is deferred revenue, which was flat quarter-on-quarter. And I guess, we expect the software to be pretty small at this point. But that deferred revenue suggests there's not a whole lot of movement in the direction of software yet from the point of view of the overall revenue. So I'm just curious, is that true? Or is there a bunch of some more software deferred revenue in there than we think? And if you could see the breakdown, we'd see more progress."

I think on your second question, on deferred revenue. It's actually up and close to 7%., 1.7% quarter-over-quarter, but 7% year-over-year. And we talked about that really the -- still the continued strength that we've seen in the maintenance. On the ELA side, and those are just a smaller portion of our total revenue.

So for the applications that are that's a very important capability. One of the companies, I mentioned in the script is the online services company in Asia. They really purchase cloud edition because they have naturally adverse to traffic. They don't have -- we have a sort of seasonal demand to their solutions. And so our ability to the capabilities and for them to really focus on what they're using is absolutely, critical. And all of that at the lower cost of ownership than in traditional VE. And so customers have not been able to get that from a vendor that has both the depth of features that we have and the world-class support that F5 brings to the table.

If we take a more of a longer term perspective, number of carriers are looking to virtualize their infrastructure and the more they moved to virtualization, the more they need solutions for A, traffic management and B, security. Those 2 challenges become more and more as they virtualize their environment. And F5 is a leading player in both areas. And so we are taking really more deliberate steps and more strategic investment in these areas as evidenced by bringing on board James figure and some of the announcements we have made about a lot we are doing in the NFB space really to make sure that we are aligned with these 5G architectures, which is virtualize architectures, because our customers are asking for more format wide as a partner as they evolve their architectures."

Number one, a lot of the customizations that we build with our customers over the last couple of years is, we've really now productized all these customization and therefore, the consumption motion or the ease of deployment is much greater for our customers. And so we would expect to see a lot more velocity in the deployment of these solutions. number two, we made substantial changes to the solution with things like ease of configuration, not make the solution consumable by security buyer not attached to an ADC.

My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. 
Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million.
GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. This beat was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and the lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year.
Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue, grew 4% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue, and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors.
Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue. SYNNEX Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11%, and Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.
I will now discuss our operating results. 
GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5% in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results.
We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by our build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.
Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. 
In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $166.22 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Now let me discuss our guidance for Q4. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see continuing momentum in the business as we close out the fiscal year. We expect to deliver another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued strength in product revenue. 
For the quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million. Today, we announced an initiative to further align spend with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we will be accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest growing areas of our business, cloud and security. As a result, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of $23 million to $25 million in Q4, that is reflected in our GAAP expense estimates.  We do not anticipate that this action will impact our Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 financial guidance that we laid out for you in March. 
In Q4, we expect GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%, including $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $317 million to $329 million, including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million to $25 million in restructuring expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. 
Our Q4 GAAP earnings target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.61 to $2.64 per share. 
On a final topic, I'm happy to report that my first few months as F5 CFO have gone very smoothly. I've had the opportunity to work with all areas and levels in the business and have been very impressed by the high quality and depth of knowledge of all F5 employees, particularly our world-class finance and accounting team.
I would like to thank everyone for their warm acceptance of me to the organization and their tireless efforts in building a fantastic business. 
With that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth.

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth. Software revenue continues to expand driven by deployments in public and private cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environments. We also saw strong demand for our security solutions, protecting enterprise customers against application-based threats. 
Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 24% year-over-year. The pace of ELA and VE subscription software deals accelerated in Q3, as customers continue to embrace flexible consumption models, a trend we think will be important in driving adoption of our new cloud offerings, including our recently introduced BIG-IP Cloud Edition.
While Cloud Edition was just released to market at the end of May, we are already seeing strong interest and pipeline across the theaters. The early feedback from customers, who purchased the product in Q3, confirms our view that rightsized application services for every app opens up a large set of use cases that were not previously well addressed by existing software ADC offerings. We expect momentum for Cloud Edition to continue to build and that it will be a meaningful driver of software growth in FY '19 and beyond.
In addition, we are seeing our customers increasingly choose to deploy a blend of both iSeries systems along with software in multi-cloud environment. Customers continue to utilize F5 security, application services and orchestration to seamlessly manage workloads across these hybrid environments. 
Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and deferred revenue of $1 billion. This team provides unparalleled customer support, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction. The value of our services capabilities will only grow, as the complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments become more prominent with our customers. 
We've shown strong execution during the third quarter for software solutions across all deployment environments with strength in public cloud, both in bring your own license and utility-based consumption. We also saw a continued sequential growth for enterprise license agreements and subscription offerings. These offerings provide flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual edition, leading to software expansion in service provider and enterprise accounts.
For instance, our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial services company help create a high-capacity DNS infrastructure. The policy-based DNS functionality provides resiliency against outages across regional hubs. The deployment works across the 3 major clouds, allowing the customer to choose the right cloud provider for the task at hand. This ELA is part of multi-cloud software infrastructure and the customer continues to buy hardware systems to support a hybrid environment.
The traction we are seeing in software is augmented with the early success of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially launched on May 31. As a reminder, this release improved per app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution provides app owners a virtual application delivery controller that can apply and automate policy when developing, deploying and securing applications across public and private clouds. 
A large online services company in Asia purchased Cloud Edition to automate application deployment and shorten scale out time. Utilizing BIG-IP functionality paired with Cloud Edition, the customer was able to auto scale instances at the app level with analytics and seamless interoperability with other F5 solutions. 
Application protection continues to be a driver of security solutions with good momentum in our WAF offerings. A leading independent research firm identified F5 as a WAF leader with multiple consumption models, including a traditional application security manager, Advanced Web Application Firewall and Silverline managed service. In the first full quarter of sale, Advanced WAF is showing strong adoption from both new and existing customers. The operational ease of configuration and deployment is attracting new stand-alone security buyers. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a European web hosting company, driven by our Advanced Web Application Firewall.
The customer deployed Advanced WAF to protect their website portals and safeguard their brand reputation from application-level compromise by sophisticated Layer 7 DDoS attacks. 
The sales team participated in a competitive evaluation and demonstrated protection from bot-based attacks and superior behavior-based protection to catch subtle application layer DDoS attempts.
Highlighting our stated objective of offering stand-alone security products to a security buyer. Today, we are introducing F5 SSL Orchestrator. This dedicated security solution allows ease of deployment and configuration for enterprise customers that demand orchestration with high performance decryption, encryption and steering of SSL traffic. This product gives customers a security appliance, offering dynamic service chaining across the security infrastructure. 
Consistent with our approach presented in our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, we will continue to expand our stand-alone security portfolio. And today, we also announced the availability of F5 Access Manager. 
Core enhancements include protection of sensitive data with adaptive authentication, while providing access for authorized users, devices and APIs, guarding against pervasive threads, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Access Manager enables organizations to bridge on-prem app functionality to the cloud, effectively integrating with identity-as-a-service solutions to support evolving, heterogeneous environments.
As we outlined over the past year, we are evolving to a multi-cloud application services company that will reach every app anywhere. With this in mind, we are realigning resources to better position F5 for 2019 and beyond. 
Today, we are taking steps to notify some employees that their roles are under consideration or will be eliminated in order to accelerate our hiring in geographic sales expansion, new sales go-to-market motions, multi-cloud software development and digital transformation initiatives. 
Our objective with these decisions is to further align our workforce with a long-term strategy and accelerate the transformation that we outlined in our Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this year.
The long-term vision set forth is seeing significant traction with continued momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments and they deploy incremental workloads dynamically, both on-premise and in cloud environments. The expansion of our software asset portfolio and stand-alone security products positions us as the leader in multi-cloud application services.
Before moving on to the question-and-answer session, I wanted to highlight 3 key additions to the leadership team. First, I am excited to announce that Chad Whalen has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Chad joined F5 18 months ago, and has built up our cloud sales team, while significantly deepening our partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Chad also brought to F5 a depth of experience that spans complex, large enterprises to fast-moving startups. His past leadership roles included Fortinet, World Wide Packets, Jasper and Ciena. Chad brings a combination of cloud, security, IoT and service provider expertise that we will leverage in our transformation to become a multi-cloud application services leader.
We were also pleased to announce on July 11, that Mary Gardner joined the F5 team as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Mary is a seasoned security leader with extensive experience in the health and finance sectors, where the protection of highly sensitive customer data and compliance with stringent regulations are business-critical issues. 
Prior to F5, Mary has held security leadership roles at Seattle Children's Hospital, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and kept information and networks safe at Port of Seattle and Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase. 
Another important addition to our leadership team is James Feger, who joined this month as General Manager for our service provider business. James comes to us after 14 years at CenturyLink, where he held multiple leadership roles supporting the design and operations of their network architecture, including his most recent role as Vice President of Network Virtualization.
His hands-on insight into the challenges and opportunities service providers face as they rollout 5G, NFV and IoT services will be invaluable to F5 as we expand our reach and role in these environments. 
I would like to welcome Chad, Mary and James to their roles on the F5 leadership team. 
As always, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the third quarter. 
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

Well, the first thing I'd say about the restructuring is that, I genuinely don't like having to make these decisions, because ideally and philosophically, we would like to embark every employee that's been part of this journey with F5 into this exciting future that we're building with the company. And the Executive team has taken immense consideration on this because we know that we are making decisions that impact the lives of many of our colleagues and friends. That being said, we are very focused on the transformation of F5 into a multi-cloud application services leader. And as a result, there is legacy spend that we have that is less relevant to the future than it has been for the past. And we are shifting our focus to the growth areas of F5. And specifically, we are intensifying our investments into software and multi-cloud technologies, in new go-to-market motions and also in building the necessary digital infrastructure that enables those go-to-market motions. And so today's restructuring is really not about cost cutting, it really is about real realignment of resources towards these areas and accelerating the execution of our strategy. In terms of how you should think about this action as it relates to long-term financial model, it's all very consistent with what we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, and so this action has no implied change in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 guidance, so this is FY '19 and also '21, '22."

I've said that, I consider acquisitions to be a potential tool in the execution of our strategy as a technology company. If and when we find that there's an opportunity that makes sense, we will execute on that. And the key for me is that we continue to be disciplined in our investments, whether they be investments in organic innovation or potential investments in inorganic innovation in the future that we've taken a very disciplined approach to both and that's what you're seeing in our actions today. In terms of the tractions that we're getting with our new stand-alone security offerings, we don't disclose customer accounts, but I can tell you that the new stand-alone security solutions that we have announced, we have already won number of customers with, including a number of customers that are net new customers to F5. And the thing that is for me a significant sign of the traction we're getting there is in a number of these deals we're winning with our SSL orchestration solutions or our Advanced WAF solutions. We are not competing with any ADC vendors. We're really only competing with traditional or next-generation security vendors. And our win rate is very strong. A good example of that is, if you take our SSL orchestration solution, we just released, it really is a use case that is absolutely critical to the security infrastructure, largely because most of the traffic now is encrypted. And so the traditional security appliances are not very efficient at doing this encryption, decryption work in addition to the security service they have to offer. And so in this case, actually, F5's hardware -- security hardware is extremely efficient than encryption and decryption and we marry that with an intelligent policy-based chaining of security services. And that allows us to provide a service chain across the full security stack and really nobody else can do that. So that's just a great use case for how our stand-alone security solutions are performing. And it is absolutely in line with our strategy to be the leader in application security."

As it relates to public cloud, again, we don't -- today, we may in the future. But we don't today, purely breakout public cloud revenues. Public cloud is actually the fastest-growing part of our business. And we continue to drive customers to public clouds both buy their license and instant sharing it in the public cloud or buying into our systems on the utility basis. I'm sure that we're now building millions of hours per quarter in the -- on all the major public clouds.

So that's, I guess, one question. Another one is related to that, which is deferred revenue, which was flat quarter-on-quarter. And I guess, we expect the software products to be pretty small at this point. But that deferred revenue suggests there's not a whole lot of movement in the direction of software yet from the point of view of the overall revenue. So I'm just curious, is that true? Or is there a bunch of some more software deferred revenue in there than we think? And if we could see the breakdown, we would see more progress."

For the first time, we are enabling application teams to self service on their ADC, which is opening up new use cases. We also for the first time enabling app teams to auto scale their solutions. So for applications that are bursting that's a very important capability. One of the companies, I mentioned in the script is an online services company in Asia. They really purchased Cloud Edition, because they have naturally a burst of traffic. They don't have -- they have a sort of seasonal demand to their solutions. And so our ability to the burst capabilities and for them to really pay for only what they're using is absolutely critical. And all of that, we're offering at the lower total cost of ownership than a traditional VE. And so customers have not been able to get that from a vendor that has both the depth of features that we have and the world-class support that F5 brings to the table. And we see that as a substantial change in the ADC market. So we're very positive on our competitive position.

And so that's going to continue to grow and then there is a number of use cases that are pretty immediate short-term that are also driving demand for our hardware, things like IoT with their high transactional-type applications drive significant demand for our hardware in the carrier space. If we take more of a longer-term perspective and a number of carriers are looking to virtualize their infrastructure and the more they moved to virtualization, the more they need solutions for, A, traffic management and B, security. Those 2 challenges become more important as they virtualize their environment. And F5 is a leading player in both areas. And so we're taking really more deliberate steps and more strategic investment in these areas as evidenced by us bringing onboard James Feger, and some of the announcements we've made around what we are doing in the NFV space really to make sure we are aligned with these 5G architectures, with these virtualize architectures, because our customers are asking for more from F5 as a partner, as they evolve their architectures."

And so we would expect to see a lot more velocity in the deployment of these solutions, and number two, we've made substantial changes to the solution with things like ease of configuration, not make the solution consumable by a security buyer not attached to an ADC.

My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. 
Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million.
GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. This beat was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and the lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year.
Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue grew 4% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue, and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors.
Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue, SYNNEX Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11%, and Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.
I will now discuss our operating results. 
GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5% in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. 
Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by our build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.
Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. 
In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $166.22 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Now let me discuss our guidance for Q4. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see continuing momentum in the business as we close out the fiscal year. We expect to deliver another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued strength in product revenue. 
For the quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million. Today, we announced an initiative to further align spend with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we will be accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest growing areas of our business, cloud and security. As a result, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of $23 million to $25 million in Q4, that is reflected in our GAAP expense estimates. We do not anticipate that this action will impact our Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 financial guidance that we laid out for you in March. 
In Q4, we expect GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%, including $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $317 million to $329 million, including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million to $25 million in restructuring expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. 
Our Q4 GAAP earnings target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.61 to $2.64 per share. 
On a final topic, I'm happy to report that my first few months as F5 CFO have gone very smoothly. I've had the opportunity to work with all areas and levels in the business and have been very impressed by the high quality and depth of knowledge of all F5 employees, particularly our world-class finance and accounting team.
I would like to thank everyone for their warm acceptance of me to the organization and their tireless efforts in building a fantastic business. 
With that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth.

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth. Software revenue continues to expand driven by deployments in public and private cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environments. We also saw strong demand for our security solutions, protecting enterprise customers against application-based threats. 
Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 24% year-over-year. The pace of ELA and VE subscription software deals accelerated in Q3, as customers continue to embrace flexible consumption models, a trend we think will be important in driving adoption of our new cloud offerings, including our recently introduced BIG-IP Cloud Edition.
While Cloud Edition was just released to market at the end of May, we are already seeing strong interest and pipeline across the theaters. The early feedback from customers who purchased the product in Q3, confirms our view that rightsized application services for every app opens up a large set of use cases that were not previously well addressed by existing software ADC offerings. We expect momentum for Cloud Edition to continue to build and that it will be a meaningful driver of software growth in FY '19 and beyond.
In addition, we are seeing our customers increasingly choose to deploy a blend of both iSeries systems along with software in multi-cloud environment. Customers continue to utilize F5 security, application services and orchestration to seamlessly manage workloads across these hybrid environments. 
Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and deferred revenue of $1 billion. This team provides unparalleled customer support, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction. The value of our services capabilities will only grow as the complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments become more prominent with our customers. 
We've shown strong execution during the third quarter for software solutions across all deployment environments with strength in public cloud, both in bring your own license and utility-based consumption. We also saw a continued sequential growth for enterprise license agreements and subscription offerings. These offerings provide flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions, leading to software expansion in service provider and enterprise accounts.
For instance, our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial services company helped create a high-capacity DNS infrastructure. The policy-based DNS functionality provides resiliency against outages across regional hubs. The deployment works across the 3 major clouds, allowing the customer to choose the right cloud provider for the task at hand. This ELA is part of a multi-cloud software infrastructure and the customer continues to buy hardware systems to support a hybrid environment.
The traction we are seeing in software is augmented with the early success of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially launched on May 31. As a reminder, this release improved per app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution provides app owners a virtual application delivery controller that can apply and automate policy when developing, deploying and securing applications across public and private clouds. 
A large online services company in Asia purchased Cloud Edition to automate application deployment and shorten scale-out time. Utilizing BIG-IP functionality paired with Cloud Edition, the customer was able to auto scale instances at the app level with analytics and seamless interoperability with other F5 solutions. 
Application protection continues to be a driver of security solutions with good momentum in our WAF offerings. A leading independent research firm identified F5 as a WAF leader with multiple consumption models, including a traditional application security manager, Advanced Web Application Firewall and Silverline managed service. In the first full quarter of sale, Advanced WAF is showing strong adoption from both new and existing customers. The operational ease of configuration and deployment is attracting new stand-alone security buyers. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a European web hosting company, driven by our Advanced Web Application Firewall.
The customer deployed Advanced WAF to protect their website portals and safeguard their brand reputation from application-level compromise by sophisticated Layer 7 DDoS attacks. 
The sales team participated in a competitive evaluation and demonstrated protection from bot-based attacks and superior behavior-based protection to catch subtle application layer DDoS attempts.
Highlighting our stated objective of offering stand-alone security products to a security buyer, today, we are introducing F5 SSL Orchestrator. This dedicated security solution allows ease of deployment and configuration for enterprise customers that demand orchestration with high performance decryption, encryption and steering of SSL traffic. This product gives customers a security appliance, offering dynamic service chaining across the security infrastructure. 
Consistent with our approach presented in our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, we will continue to expand our stand-alone security portfolio. And today, we also announced the availability of F5 Access Manager. 
Core enhancements include protection of sensitive data with adaptive authentication, while providing access for authorized users, devices and APIs, guarding against pervasive threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Access Manager enables organizations to bridge on-prem app functionality to the cloud, effectively integrating with identity-as-a-service solutions to support evolving, heterogeneous environments.
As we outlined over the past year, we are evolving to a multi-cloud application services company that will reach every app anywhere. With this in mind, we are realigning resources to better position F5 for 2019 and beyond. 
Today, we are taking steps to notify some employees that their roles are under consideration or will be eliminated in order to accelerate our hiring in geographic sales expansion, new sales go-to-market motions, multi-cloud software development and digital transformation initiatives. 
Our objective with these decisions is to further align our workforce with a long-term strategy and accelerate the transformation that we outlined in our Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this year.
The long-term vision set forth is seeing significant traction with continued momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments as they deploy incremental workloads dynamically, both on-premise and in cloud environments. The expansion of our software asset portfolio and stand-alone security products positions us as the leader in multi-cloud application services.
Before moving on to the question-and-answer session, I wanted to highlight 3 key additions to the leadership team. First, I am excited to announce that Chad Whalen has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Chad joined F5 18 months ago, and has built up our cloud sales team, while significantly deepening our partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Chad also brought to F5 a depth of experience that spans complex, large enterprises to fast-moving startups. His past leadership roles included Fortinet, World Wide Packets, Jasper and Ciena. Chad brings a combination of cloud, security, IoT and service provider expertise that we will leverage in our transformation to become a multi-cloud application services leader.
We were also pleased to announce on July 11 that Mary Gardner joined the F5 team as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Mary is a seasoned security leader with extensive experience in the health and finance sectors, where the protection of highly sensitive customer data and compliance with stringent regulations are business-critical issues. 
Prior to F5, Mary has held security leadership roles at Seattle Children's Hospital, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and kept information and networks safe at Port of Seattle and Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase. 
Another important addition to our leadership team is James Feger, who joined this month as General Manager for our service provider business. James comes to us after 14 years at CenturyLink, where he held multiple leadership roles supporting the design and operations of their network architecture, including his most recent role as Vice President of Network Virtualization.
His hands-on insight into the challenges and opportunities service providers face as they roll out 5G, NFV and IoT services will be invaluable to F5 as we expand our reach and role in these environments. 
I would like to welcome Chad, Mary and James to their roles on the F5 leadership team. 
As always, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the third quarter. 
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

Well, the first thing I'd say about the restructuring is that I genuinely don't like having to make these decisions, because ideally and philosophically, we would like to embark every employee that's been part of this journey with F5 into this exciting future that we're building with the company. And the Executive team has taken immense consideration on this because we know that we are making decisions that impact the lives of many of our colleagues and friends. That being said, we are very focused on the transformation of F5 into a multi-cloud application services leader. And as a result, there is legacy spend that we have that is less relevant to the future than it has been for the past. And we are shifting our focus to the growth areas of F5. And specifically, we are intensifying our investments into software and multi-cloud technologies, in new go-to-market motions and also in building the necessary digital infrastructure that enables those go-to-market motions. And so today's restructuring is really not about cost cutting, it really is about realignment of resources towards these areas and accelerating the execution of our strategy. In terms of how you should think about this action as it relates to long-term financial model, it's all very consistent with what we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, and so this action has no implied change in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 guidance, so this is FY '19-'20 and also '21-'22."

I've said that, I consider acquisitions to be a potential tool in the execution of our strategy as a technology company. If and when we find that there's an opportunity that makes sense, we will execute on that. And the key for me is that we continue to be disciplined in our investments, whether they be investments in organic innovation or potential investments in inorganic innovation in the future that we've taken a very disciplined approach to both and that's part of what you're seeing in our actions today. In terms of the tractions that we're getting with our new stand-alone security offerings, we don't disclose customer accounts, but I can tell you that the new stand-alone security solutions that we have announced, we have already won number of customers with those, including a number of customers that are net new customers to F5. And the thing that is for me a significant sign of the traction we're getting there is in a number of these deals we're winning with our SSL orchestration solutions or our Advanced WAF solutions. We are not competing with any ADC vendors. We're really only competing with traditional or next-generation security vendors. And our win rate is very strong. A good example of that is, if you take our SSL orchestration solution we've just released, it really is a use case that is absolutely critical to the security infrastructure, largely because most of the traffic now is encrypted. And so the traditional security appliances are not very efficient at doing this encryption, decryption work in addition to the security service they have to offer. And so in this case, actually, F5's hardware -- security hardware is extremely efficient than encryption and decryption and we marry that with an intelligent policy-based chaining of security services. And that allows us to provide a service chain across the full security stack and really nobody else can do that. So that's just a great use case for how our stand-alone security solutions are performing. And it is absolutely in line with our strategy to be the leader in application security."

As it relates to public cloud, again, we don't -- today, we may in the future. But we don't today, purely break out public cloud revenues. Public cloud is actually the fastest-growing part of our business.

And so that's where we see significant acceleration of our software solutions in the future. But I just can't quantify it for you yet."

And sequentially, every quarter over the last 3 quarters, we have seen the traction in pipeline with this consumption model growing with our customers. And this quarter, we had a record number of such deals on software and on these enterprise license agreements. They are particularly important to us, because we can land customers on these deals and over time expand them as they add to their initial subscription. So generally, pretty excited about what's happening with the large million-dollar-plus software deals that we are seeing."

So that's, I guess, one question. Another one is related to that, which is deferred revenue, which was flat quarter-on-quarter. And I guess we expect the software priors to be pretty small at this point. But that deferred revenue suggests there's not a whole lot of movement in the direction of software yet from the point of view of the overall revenue. So I'm just curious, is that true?

For the first time, we are enabling application teams to self service on their ADC, which is opening up new use cases. We also for the first time enabling app teams to auto scale their solutions. So for applications that are bursty, that's a very important capability. One of the companies I mentioned in the script is an online services company in Asia. They really purchased Cloud Edition because they have naturally a bursty traffic. They don't have -- they have a sort of seasonal demand to their solutions. And so our ability to burst the capabilities and for them to really pay for only what they're using is absolutely critical. And all of that, we're offering at the lower total cost of ownership than a traditional VE. And so customers have not been able to get that from a vendor that has both the depth of features that we have and the world-class support that F5 brings to the table.

If we take more of a longer-term perspective and a number of carriers are looking to virtualize their infrastructure and the more they move to virtualization, the more they need solutions for, A, traffic management and B, security. Those 2 challenges become more important as they virtualize their environment. And F5 is a leading player in both areas. And so we're taking really more deliberate steps and more strategic investment in these areas as evidenced by us bringing onboard James Feger, and some of the announcements we've made around what we are doing in the NFV space really to make sure we are aligned with these 5G architectures, with these virtualize architectures, because our customers are asking for more from F5 as a partner as they evolve their architectures."

Number one, a lot of the customizations that we built with our customers over the last couple of years, we've really now productized all these customization and therefore, the consumption motion or the ease of deployment is much greater for our customers. And so we would expect to see a lot more velocity in the deployment of these solutions, and #2, we've made substantial changes to the solution with things like ease of configuration, not make the solution consumable by a security buyer not attached to an ADC.

I think some of that -- if you recall, we said last fall that we were making a realignment of our resources in Europe to address the -- where we thought there was better growth opportunity. And I think to some extent, we're seeing the benefit of that play out in the growth, and the team in the Europe actually has executed very well over the last few quarters. We are cautious about Europe because we're still seeing the macro uncertainty is not gone completely, specifically with the U.K. and Brexit. So we want to be -- we don't want to get too carried away on what we're seeing in Europe. But we're pleased with the performance this quarter and specifically the execution of our teams. In the service provider space, Meta, we don't have a specific target for a percentage of our business because over time, we expect our enterprise and fed business to continue to grow and we expect our service provider business to grow as well. The one thing I would say is, in the service provider space, especially as you go through architectural changes, changes in the amount of business happen over a period of time. And right now we're making, I think, strategic and deliberate investments in that space that will play out over our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2, especially as it relates to NFV."

My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. 
Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit. 
Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million.
GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. This beat was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and the lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share. 
In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year.
Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue grew 4% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue, and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we had 5 greater than 10% distributors.
Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue, SYNNEX Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11%, and Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.
I will now discuss our operating results. 
GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5% in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. 
Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by our build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.
Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. 
In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $166.22 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Now let me discuss our guidance for Q4. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see continuing momentum in the business as we close out the fiscal year. We expect to deliver another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued strength in product revenue. 
For the quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million. Today, we announced an initiative to further align spend with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we will be accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest growing areas of our business, cloud and security. As a result, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of $23 million to $25 million in Q4, that is reflected in our GAAP expense estimates. We do not anticipate that this action will impact our Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 financial guidance that we laid out for you in March. 
In Q4, we expect GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%, including $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $317 million to $329 million, including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million to $25 million in restructuring expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. 
Our Q4 GAAP earnings target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.61 to $2.64 per share. 
On a final topic, I'm happy to report that my first few months as F5 CFO have gone very smoothly. I've had the opportunity to work with all areas and levels in the business and have been very impressed by the high quality and depth of knowledge of all F5 employees, particularly our world-class finance and accounting team.
I would like to thank everyone for their warm acceptance of me to the organization and their tireless efforts in building a fantastic business. 
With that, I will turn the call over to François."

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth.

During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth. Software revenue continues to expand driven by deployments in public and private cloud, as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environments. We also saw strong demand for our security solutions, protecting enterprise customers against application-based threats. 
Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 24% year-over-year. The pace of ELA and VE subscription software deals accelerated in Q3, as customers continue to embrace flexible consumption models, a trend we think will be important in driving adoption of our new cloud offerings, including our recently introduced BIG-IP Cloud Edition.
While Cloud Edition was just released to market at the end of May, we are already seeing strong interest and pipeline across the theaters. The early feedback from customers who purchased the product in Q3, confirms our view that rightsized application services for every app opens up a large set of use cases that were not previously well addressed by existing software ADC offerings. We expect momentum for Cloud Edition to continue to build and that it will be a meaningful driver of software growth in FY '19 and beyond.
In addition, we are seeing our customers increasingly choose to deploy a blend of both iSeries systems along with software in multi-cloud environment. Customers continue to utilize F5 security, application services and orchestration to seamlessly manage workloads across these hybrid environments. 
Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and deferred revenue of $1 billion. This team provides unparalleled customer support, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction. The value of our services capabilities will only grow as the complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments become more prominent with our customers. 
We've shown strong execution during the third quarter for software solutions across all deployment environments with strength in public cloud, both in bring your own license and utility-based consumption. We also saw a continued sequential growth for enterprise license agreements and subscription offerings. These offerings provide flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions, leading to software expansion in service provider and enterprise accounts.
For instance, our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial services company helped create a high-capacity DNS infrastructure. The policy-based DNS functionality provides resiliency against outages across regional hubs. The deployment works across the 3 major clouds, allowing the customer to choose the right cloud provider for the task at hand. This ELA is part of a multi-cloud software infrastructure and the customer continues to buy hardware systems to support a hybrid environment.
The traction we are seeing in software is augmented with the early success of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially launched on May 31. As a reminder, this release improved per app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution provides app owners a virtual application delivery controller that can apply and automate policy when developing, deploying and securing applications across public and private clouds. 
A large online services company in Asia purchased Cloud Edition to automate application deployment and shorten scale-out time. Utilizing BIG-IP functionality paired with Cloud Edition, the customer was able to auto scale instances at the app level with analytics and seamless interoperability with other F5 solutions. 
Application protection continues to be a driver of security solutions with good momentum in our WAF offerings. A leading independent research firm identified F5 as a WAF leader with multiple consumption models, including a traditional application security manager, Advanced Web Application Firewall and Silverline managed service. In the first full quarter of sale, Advanced WAF is showing strong adoption from both new and existing customers. The operational ease of configuration and deployment is attracting new stand-alone security buyers. A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a European web hosting company, driven by our Advanced Web Application Firewall.
The customer deployed Advanced WAF to protect their website portals and safeguard their brand reputation from application-level compromise by sophisticated Layer 7 DDoS attacks. 
The sales team participated in a competitive evaluation and demonstrated protection from bot-based attacks and superior behavior-based protection to catch subtle application layer DDoS attempts.
Highlighting our stated objective of offering stand-alone security products to a security buyer, today, we are introducing F5 SSL Orchestrator. This dedicated security solution allows ease of deployment and configuration for enterprise customers that demand orchestration with high-performance decryption, encryption and steering of SSL traffic. This product gives customers a security appliance, offering dynamic service chaining across the security infrastructure. 
Consistent with our approach presented in our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, we will continue to expand our stand-alone security portfolio. And today, we also announced the availability of F5 Access Manager. 
Core enhancements include protection of sensitive data with adaptive authentication while providing access for authorized users, devices and APIs, guarding against pervasive threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Access Manager enables organizations to bridge on-prem app functionality to the cloud, effectively integrating with identity-as-a-service solutions to support evolving, heterogeneous environments.
As we outlined over the past year, we are evolving to a multi-cloud application services company that will reach every app anywhere. With this in mind, we are realigning resources to better position F5 for 2019 and beyond. 
Today, we are taking steps to notify some employees that their roles are under consideration or will be eliminated in order to accelerate our hiring in geographic sales expansion, new sales go-to-market motions, multi-cloud software development and digital transformation initiatives. 
Our objective with these decisions is to further align our workforce with a long-term strategy and accelerate the transformation that we outlined in our Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this year.
The long-term vision set forth is seeing significant traction with continued momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments as they deploy incremental workloads dynamically, both on-premise and in cloud environments. The expansion of our software asset portfolio and stand-alone security products positions us as the leader in multi-cloud application services.
Before moving on to the question-and-answer session, I wanted to highlight 3 key additions to the leadership team. First, I am excited to announce that Chad Whalen has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Chad joined F5 18 months ago and has built up our cloud sales team, while significantly deepening our partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Chad also brought to F5 a depth of experience that spans complex, large enterprises to fast-moving startups. His past leadership roles included Fortinet, World Wide Packets, Jasper and Ciena. Chad brings a combination of cloud, security, IoT and service provider expertise that we will leverage in our transformation to become a multi-cloud application services leader.
We were also pleased to announce on July 11 that Mary Gardner joined the F5 team as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Mary is a seasoned security leader with extensive experience in the health and finance sectors, where the protection of highly sensitive customer data and compliance with stringent regulations are business-critical issues. 
Prior to F5, Mary has held security leadership roles at Seattle Children's Hospital, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and kept information and networks safe at Port of Seattle and Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase. 
Another important addition to our leadership team is James Feger, who joined this month as General Manager for our service provider business. James comes to us after 14 years at CenturyLink, where he held multiple leadership roles supporting the design and operations of their network architecture, including his most recent role as Vice President of Network Virtualization.
His hands-on insight into the challenges and opportunities service providers face as they roll out 5G, NFV and IoT services will be invaluable to F5 as we expand our reach and role in these environments. 
I would like to welcome Chad, Mary and James to their roles on the F5 leadership team. 
As always, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the third quarter. 
With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

Well, the first thing I'd say about the restructuring is that I genuinely don't like having to make these decisions, because ideally and philosophically, we would like to embark every employee that's been part of this journey with F5 into this exciting future that we're building with the company. And the Executive team has taken immense consideration on this because we know that we are making decisions that impact the lives of many of our colleagues and friends. That being said, we are very focused on the transformation of F5 into a multi-cloud application services leader. And as a result, there is legacy spend that we have that is less relevant to the future than it has been for the past. And we are shifting our focus to the growth areas of F5. And specifically, we are intensifying our investments into software and multi-cloud technologies, in new go-to-market motions and also in building the necessary digital infrastructure that enables those go-to-market motions. And so today's restructuring is really not about cost cutting; it really is about realignment of resources towards these areas and accelerating the execution of our strategy. In terms of how you should think about this action as it relates to long-term financial model, it's all very consistent with what we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in March, and so this action has no implied change in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 guidance, so this is FY '19-'20 and also '21-'22."

I've said that I consider acquisitions to be a potential tool in the execution of our strategy as a technology company. If and when we find that there's an opportunity that makes sense, we will execute on that. And the key for me is that we continue to be disciplined in our investments, whether they be investments in organic innovation or potential investments in inorganic innovation in the future that we've taken a very disciplined approach to both and that's part of what you're seeing in our actions today. In terms of the tractions that we're getting with our new stand-alone security offerings, we don't disclose customer accounts, but I can tell you that the new stand-alone security solutions that we have announced, we have already won number of customers with those, including a number of customers that are net new customers to F5. And the thing that is for me a significant sign of the traction we're getting there is in a number of these deals we're winning with our SSL orchestration solutions or our Advanced WAF solutions. We are not competing with any ADC vendors. We're really only competing with traditional or next-generation security vendors. And our win rate is very strong. A good example of that is, if you take our SSL orchestration solution we've just released, it really is a use case that is absolutely critical to the security infrastructure, largely because most of the traffic now is encrypted. And so the traditional security appliances are not very efficient at doing this encryption, decryption work in addition to the security service they have to offer. And so in this case, actually, F5's hardware -- security hardware is extremely efficient than encryption and decryption and we marry that with an intelligent policy-based chaining of security services. And that allows us to provide a service chain across the full security stack and really nobody else can do that. So that's just a great use case for how our stand-alone security solutions are performing. And it is absolutely in line with our strategy to be the leader in application security."

And it's not just that we won't, but let me start with security. In security, our business is both some stand-alone security use cases as well as security-driven use cases in our ADC business. And sometimes breaking that up is actually quite subjective on our part. And this is one of the reasons that we don't disclose that information. I can, on the other hand, share with you that security as a whole is a, one of the faster-growing areas of our business. So it is growing faster than the aggregate revenue, if you will. As it relates to public cloud, again, we don't -- today, we may in the future. But we don't today, purely break out public cloud revenues. Public cloud is actually the fastest-growing part of our business. And we continue to drive customers to public clouds both buy their license and instant sharing it in the public cloud or buying into our systems on a utility basis. I'm sure that we're now building millions of hours per quarter in the -- on all the major public clouds. And our Cloud Edition we've just released, actually, we expect to accelerate that, because it makes it easy for customers to burst some of their applications into a public cloud, leveraging our auto scale capabilities. And so that's where we see significant acceleration of our software solutions in the future. But I just can't quantify it for you yet."

So that's, I guess, one question. Another one is related to that, which is deferred revenue, which was flat quarter-on-quarter. And I guess we expect the software priors to be pretty small at this point. But that deferred revenue suggests there's not a whole lot of movement in the direction of software yet from the point of view of the overall revenue. So I'm just curious, is that true?

For the first time, we are enabling application teams to self service on their ADC, which is opening up new use cases. We also for the first time enabling app teams to auto scale their solutions. So for applications that are bursty, that's a very important capability. One of the companies I mentioned in the script is an online services company in Asia. They really purchased Cloud Edition because they have naturally a bursty traffic. They don't have -- they have a sort of seasonal demand to their solutions. And so our ability to burst the capabilities and for them to really pay for only what they're using is absolutely critical. And all of that, we're offering at the lower total cost of ownership than a traditional VE. And so customers have not been able to get that from a vendor that has both the depth of features that we have and the world-class support that F5 brings to the table.

Those 2 challenges become more important as they virtualize their environment. And F5 is a leading player in both areas.

And so we would expect to see a lot more velocity in the deployment of these solutions, and #2, we've made substantial changes to the solution with things like ease of configuration, not make the solution consumable by a security buyer not attached to an ADC.

We are cautious about Europe because we're still seeing the macro uncertainty is not gone completely, specifically with the U.K. and Brexit. So we want to be -- we don't want to get too carried away on what we're seeing in Europe. But we're pleased with the performance this quarter and specifically the execution of our teams. In the service provider space, Meta, we don't have a specific target for a percentage of our business because over time, we expect our enterprise and fed business to continue to grow and we expect our service provider business to grow as well. The one thing I would say is, in the service provider space, especially as you go through architectural changes, changes in the amount of business happen over a period of time.

Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we executed and overachieved our 2018 plan and continue to align to horizon 1 and horizon 2 goals, driving growth and strong operational results across the business during the fourth quarter. We are seeing significant traction for the long-term vision we outlined in our March 2018 Analyst and Investor Day, and furthering momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environment, as they deploy incremental workloads, dynamically both on premises and in cloud environment. Our product revenue growth continued in Q4 with products delivering 3% growth led by software. Public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area with an increasing demand for security solutions.  We expect our Cloud-Native offerings will allow us to extend that growth and expand our public cloud reach in 2019. In addition, we continue to see strong customer response to our recently launched ELA and virtual edition subscription consumption models. Good initial deal closure and strong pipeline growth indicates that these function model will be especially important with our new cloud offerings including BIG-IP Cloud Edition. Systems continues to show resilience with growth opportunities in certain geographies, including China and Latin America, and with customers that want to control and manage the end-to-end application delivery solution and certain high-performance use cases.  Rounding out the business drivers, our Services business continues to perform well, delivering 6% growth in the quarter. We are seeing consistently strong attach rates on maintenance and driving continued year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We're particularly proud of our continued world-class customer satisfaction scores, reflecting our relentless commitment to our customers and their increasingly complex application deployment. I will speak more on some of the customer wins and use cases in the quarter later in our prepared remarks. But right now I'll hand the call to Frank to review our Q4 and fiscal year 2018 results and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Frank?"

As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $565",1100,"Thank you, François. As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $565 million. GAAP EPS of $2.18 per share was well above our guidance of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 per share was also well above our guidance of $2.61 to $2.64 per share. The beats for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were driven largely by strength in revenue, expense discipline and lower-than-expected effective tax rates. Q4 product revenue up $256 million, was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. Software was approximately 17% of product revenue and grew more than 19% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 83% of product revenue and grew 18 basis points year-over-year.  Services revenue of $306 million, grew 6% year-over-year, and represented approximately 54% of total revenue. On a regional basis in Q4, Americas grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 25% of overall revenue. APAC revenue grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 15% of total revenue, while Japan grew 15% year-over-year and accounted for 5% of total revenue. Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 16%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.  In Q4, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue, Tech Data, which accounted for 11% and Westcon and Arrow, each at 10%. Let's now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were slightly better than our expectations, driven by the strength in services margin, as we continue to leverage automation to optimize our support organization. Last quarter, we took steps to further align investment with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we are accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest-growing opportunities of our business in cloud and security. As a result, we took $20.9 million in restructuring and facility exit charges during Q4, which are reflected in our GAAP results.  GAAP operating expenses of $316 million were below our $317 million to $329 million guided range, driven largely by operating efficiency and lower-than-expected restructuring expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were within our guidance range at $263 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 27.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% lower than anticipated, due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.3%.  GAAP and non-GAAP effective rates also benefited from year-end adjustments related to our domestic tax filings as well as our mix of profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.45 billion at year-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 47 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.4 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 5.3% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. On employees, our restructuring initiative in Q4 impacted approximately 215 employees. Executing on our plan to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, during the quarter, we hired 150 employees and ended the quarter with approximately 4,410 employees, down approximately 65 people from Q3.  We continue to hire aggressively in our growth areas. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 864,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $173.69 per share for a total of $150 million. Quickly recapping our fiscal year results. For the full year, total revenue grew 3.4% to $2.16 billion. Product revenue of $960 million decreased 0.5% from the prior year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Within product revenue, software revenue grew 23%, while systems revenue declined 4% over the same period. Services revenue of $1.2 billion grew approximately 6.7% during the year and represented 56% of the total. GAAP net income for FY '18 was $454 million or $7.32 per share and non-GAAP net income was $612 million or $9.87 per share. In FY '18, cash flow from operations totaled $761 million and capital expenditures were $53 million.  Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q1 of FY '19. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Overall, we remain confident in our position in the market and the growth opportunities for the business was solid software momentum. We believe the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environment is strong and will be a fundamental growth driver for the solutions we offer today and those we will launch in 2019. With this in mind as well as factoring in our normal seasonality, for the first quarter of FY '19, we are targeting revenue in the range of $542 million to $552 million.  We expect gross margins at or around 85%. We estimate operating expenses of $265 million to $277 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be between 21% and 22% with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.51 to $2.54 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $39 million and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with broad modeling assumptions from FY '19 fiscal year. As we discussed in March at our investor conference, we are tracking to our horizon 1 outlook with FY '19 operating plan. For FY '19, from the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We anticipate gross margins at or around 85% for the year. We expect operating margin in the mid-30s range, in line with recent years results, moving down slightly in Q2 and Q3 from Q1 and then in Q4 in the upper 30s. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in a range of $155 million to $165 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million in cost related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in  downtown Seattle, as we ready the space for occupancy this year. With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

I'll spend a few minutes highlighting some customer wins and use cases from the quarter. Then I'll conclude our prepared remarks with comments about drivers for fiscal 2019 and our evolution to a multi-cloud application services company. The first customer win I'll talked to spotlight F5 role in network function virtualization. During the quarter, a large Tier 1 service provider selected F5 in an initial 5G VNS deployment based on overall performance in our virtual edition platform's ability to consolidate various functions within the core. Importantly, the customer expects to use this as the baseline for the future virtualized core designs. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we continue to see good acceptance of our new ELA and subscription consumption models, which are another element of F5's multi-cloud value proposition, offering customers insurance against the uncertainties associated with cloud deployment, including providing timeline flexibility. Another example, we secured an ELA deal in Q4 with a North American healthcare infrastructure provider, who provides a Software-as-a-Service offering. An existing F5 customer, this customer requires the same level of F5 application services they had on-prem as they moved to the public cloud.  The ELA structure was important because it provided the agility they needed, as the scale their offerings over time. And added bonus, F5's ability to provide multiple services enabled the customer to consolidate several security elements of their existing infrastructure. Turning to our security offerings. Advanced Web Application Firewall or advanced continues on a solid growth trajectory. F5's provides a powerful set of security features that fits web application safe from attack. In 1 deployment during the quarter, we replaced the competitor in a virtual edition software environment, specifically because of our bot detection and litigation capabilities. We were also deployed by a managed care provider who are moving to the public cloud to reduce the time to turn up new customer applications. We worked with the customer to move critical applications from shared F5 appliances through dedicated high performance virtual additions, extending the same on-prem policy to their cloud deployments and replace the application security manager or ASM with based on the existing F5 appliances, while deploying virtual editions with the best to support new applications in the public cloud. This customer will also deploy our BIG-IP cloud addition to support new apps going into the public cloud.  And these are just a few examples of wins the sales teams is driving. Let me close our remarks today with some thoughts about fiscal 2019. Last quarter, we spoke to our efforts to repurpose investment to focus on growth areas and ensure our product development and sales efforts were aligned with our most significant growth opportunities. As Frank noted, we're adding resources in priority areas and expanding our software portfolio and stand-alone security products. As a result, we've got several new drivers to move in fiscal 2019. One of these drivers is our BIG-IP Cloud Edition, a bundle of our BIG-IP centralized manage solution and BIG-IP Virtual Edition sold on a per-app basis, Cloud Edition helps us address a large subset of application by reducing the total cost of ownership of providing application services, while providing more application management. We have strong conviction that Cloud Edition is addressing new use cases and will be instrumental in expanding our multi-cloud platform strategy. While not yet a material contributor to our revenue, the platform's ability to provide a single management for both on-prem and cloud application services is resonating strongly with customers and the regional demand we saw for the product immediately following its release in April 2018, has now turned global.  We are seeing strong interest and demand across all our territories, and we expect sales activity to increase in fiscal 2019, as we build customer references. In our security portfolio, we've got a new stand-alone version of SSL Orchestrator scheduled for release in December. The amount of SSL traffic is growing rapidly, requiring customers to use significant resources to greater inspect for security purposes.  F5's SSL Orchestrator has strong traction as a solution on a range of F5 platforms and we expect its availability as a stand-alone product to enable increased penetration with security buyers. Designed to optimize customers' SSL infrastructure by providing security devices with highly efficient visibility of encrypted traffic, it also supports policy-based management and stealing of traffic through existing security devices to training. This makes it easy to integrate into existing architectures, enabling customers to easily apply corporate security controls to all their encrypted traffic. We are already building a strong pipeline for the stand-alone SSL Orchestrator offering, particularly with enterprise and government customers, and the sales team is very excited about the opportunity to drive additional growth in new buying centers.  We are also making good progress with both our F5 as a Service and Cloud-Native platforms. When we spoke about F5 as a Service at our Analyst and Investor event in March of 2018, we said, we expect them to launch in 2019. At this point, I'm pleased to say we're on track for first commercial availability in the first half of calendar 2019, and are starting to build pilots for lighthouse customers. In concert, we are working internally to build the muscle that will enable us to target the expanded customers set, we expect this product would appeal to. Our internal digital transformation efforts, include expanding our digital motion to ensure frictionless procurement and service renewals. At the March Investor event, we also highlighted the investment we're making to deliver Cloud-Native Applications Services in FY '19. This program is also on track for launch in the first half of calendar 2019. Our innovation teams have built out functionality that enables intelligent traffic management services and an API-first interaction model across select private and public clouds. I have seen the product demos, and I'm looking forward to sharing more, as we progress with our efforts to unlock demand through lighter weight offerings optimized for CIC eWorkflows. In addition to pushing forward with our multi-cloud focus solutions set, we're also building our public cloud expertise. I'm pleased to announce that Barry Russell has joined F5 from AWS to succeed Chad Whalen in leading our cloud sales team. Barry is a business development, sales and operational leader who brings us 20-plus years of experience. Most recently, Barry was General Manager of Global Business Development and Field Operations for the AWS Marketplace and Service Catalog, where he built the AWS Marketplace ISDA system, a digital software catalog. Barry's prior leadership role include business development and service providers sales leadership at Microsoft as well as communications and we're very excited to have him on board to further F5's expansion into multi-cloud opportunities globally.  Barry joins another former AWS colleague, who joined F5 in fiscal 2018 to lead our F5 as a Service business. is a seasoned software it's an expert in cost computing with leadership experience extending product development, product management, program management and production and solutions marketing. Leading experience with public cloud services and infrastructure platforms, services development, deployment and operation and enterprise IT transformation to cloud made him ideal to lead our F5 as a Service program. Prior to joining and running 2018, was General Manager in the Amazon Relational Database Services business unit and previously held leadership roles at Limelight Networks, VMware and Microsoft.  We're excited to have both Barry and cloud expertise at F5. In closing, I reiterate that we are making meaningful progress toward our long-term vision for F5 with continued momentum in software and security solutions. My thanks to the entire F5 team and our partners for the progress we've made. As a team, we're excited about the year ahead, and we look forward to reporting on our continued progress in fiscal 2019. With that, we will now open the call to Q&A."

So the first thing, Rod on software, I'd tell you, no, you should not read anything into the 19%. I'm very excited about where we're at on software generally and where we're going to be in 2019. The context for the Q4 19% is, first of all, software as a percentage of overall revenue is still relatively small. And so as I shared in last quarter, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but the general trends are going to be what we've said. We specifically for this quarter, we had a tough compared to Q4 of 2017, which was a big software quarter. I think that's part of what you're seeing in this growth rate that's a little less than last quarter. But if you look overall, in Q4, 17% was -- sorry, software was 17% of product revenue, so we're up from 15% in prior quarter. And as a percentage of mix, we're on trajectory to achieve our horizon 1 goals. I said I'm very excited for where we're at on software and that's because of what I foresee is going to be happening in 2019. So at our analyst conference, we said, we would be in horizon 1, which was 2019 and 2020, we said we will see software growth that would be in the 30% to 35% range. And I feel confident we're going to be in that range. We have got a lot of things driving software growth in 2019. First of all, I'll point to just 3 of them. First of all, we're seeing really good momentum on our ELAs, enterprise license agreements. They're driving a larger deal size and they're also allowing us to expand our use cases and start to take footprint for either -- from either Cloud-Native or different open source of virtual competitors with these new model of consumption. And so that's going to drive growth in software. Our Cloud Edition is ramping very well from the first 4 months we've had in the market. So we expect a meaningful contribution from Cloud Edition in 2019. And as you probably heard from the script, we also have new products that are coming now in the first half of 2019, both F5 as a Service and our Cloud-Native services platform. So we have got very good drivers in '19, and I expect we're going to be in the range that we've discussed for horizon 1. Frank, on China?"

The new cloud edition on a per unit basis is a fraction of the price of the virtual edition, but remember that a virtual edition typically support anywhere between 5 and 10 applications, and a cloud edition is brought on a per application basis. And so what we're seeing in the initial deals that we've done on cloud edition is that the number of apps that are supported is significant. And so overall, there is no impact on the deal size. It's about the same deal size as what it's been on virtual edition. It's just a different consumption model that allows more flexibility for the user to manage their infrastructure on a per-app basis."

We have a lot of customers that are buying traditional hardware motion and are adding to that virtual editions -- virtual editions on-prem, that's kind of a classic deployment model. What we're seeing is more and more these customers also want to deploy their infrastructure in multiple public clouds. And their desire is to manage all these instances of idiocies as part of a single portfolio and ideally through single glass. Our ELAs enable them to do that and give them flexibility to consume as many licenses as they want of software, whether they want licenses on-prem or in the public cloud. The initial -- I'm talking about software purely right now. The initial view we're seeing from the kingdoms of these ELAs is very strong, i.e. the signed up for a minimum amount of consumption and we are seeing in the early months of consumption that they are well on track to exceed that minimal amount of consumption, which bodes well for true up in the future. What we are seeing as it relates to hardware is that generally, customers that users in a multi-cloud deployment scenario overall spend more with us than customers that use just in a traditional hardware deployment models. So that's I think, how I would frame it for you is the overall spend for multi-cloud customary larger than one that is not or one that is to hardware."

So minimal contribution in '18, but we do expect given the traction that we have seen so far, we do expect meaningful contribution in fiscal '19. In terms of the gross margin, yes, the answer is no different that what we stood out. We do expect software contribution grow to have some impact on our -- probably not impact on our gross margin. If you recall at the end of our horizon 2, which is 2022, we expect that our software to be about 40% of total product revenues. I think by then, we would see meaningful impact. That being said, our margins are roughly 85% right now. And so the room for expansion isn't significant.

What we're seeing with Cloud Edition is, within our existing customers, we are unlocking new footprint that we didn't have before. There are a couple of use cases that we could not address before. One is, when customers want to really deploy on a per-app basis, we couldn't touch of those types of we now can. Two, is the ability to scale rapidly the infrastructure under an application, that sort of flexibility is a new use case for us and is expanding our footprint attaching new application, specifically applications that are investing development. We didn't have a before to intercept these applications that there Inception, and now we can. And the third aspect of that is, we are also now for the first time giving application developers to less visibility into their virtual expense of F5. And they are seeing analytics and the performance of their applications, and so we're building a relationship with that developer that we didn't have before and that's driving new deployments into new applications. So I would characterize it right now as largely addressing the longtail of applications you heard us talk about inside of existing customers more than focusing on growing and looking out for new customers. I do think though we will address new customer segments, as we introduce in first half of '19 F5 as a Service and our Cloud-Native app services platform."

And I think what you've seen over the last 3 quarters is we've done exactly that. In this quarter, we were flat. We still expect quarterly fluctuations on the hardware number, but overall, we're executing for and I think you're getting share. And there are couple of reasons for that. One driver of the stability is security use cases driving spend in ADC for us that's not all ADC vendors have access to if they don't have the security, things like SSL and orchestration our web application firewall or Access Manager consolidated on in ADC, that's driving stability for us in ADC. There are new use cases, such as steps in the federal sector or IoT that are driving demand for our hardware products. There are geographies where there is significant demand for new hardware, specifically in emerging market, places like China and Latin America.

And we have seen some of them almost graduate from this cloud environment and come back and run co-location capabilities and actually, come back to us for hardware ADCs. So we have seen those cases. I don't know this is a trend that it's going to be much stronger in the future than it is today, but we are seeing that. But as it relates to, I mean, acquiring customers directly in the cloud for companies that were historically on-prem like us, we gets an opportunity last, you are right we don't play in that market today. But that's why we are quite excited about F5 as a Service coming in FY '19 because that's going to allow us to really intercept the ball in the cloud application in the native cloud consumption experience for those who are building the app even the public cloud platform environment. And so we're pretty excited about our opportunity to play their and intercept these applications. And then down the road, what these applications we do, if they do have multi-cloud requirements, it will make it that much easier for us to contribute to their requirements beyond the single public cloud.

So in terms of disclosure of security revenues, as you know, we don't break that out. I would say that the percentage of our ADC sales that are driven by security use cases or that include a component of security in the overall bundle has steadily increased. And today, it's a meaningful percentage of our ADC sales. We don't break it out. It's not just a question of on the size of the revenue, but it has to do with -- in a number of cases, it's very subjective to determining whether a sale was driven by security our ADC or both. And so that's the reason that we don't break it out today and there is not a clear trigger of when we will. In terms of your -- I think, the third part of your question then the second one. Where we have been seeing very strong success today, historically, I would say that would be up until kind of the middle of 2018 was really in these consolidated use cases, where it's very convenient for a lot of our enterprise customers to consolidate onto an ADC application firewall, identity and access capability from encryption, decryption capabilities. And so this use case of consolidation in the ADC and enterprise has been extremely successful, while continued to be, that is also true the service provider world where our capabilities around CG, optimization, carrier-grade firewall, consolidated into and ADC capability is very appealing to service providers. So I would say, if you look historically, the consolidation of multiple security modules and functions that allows 1 to reduce CapEx and reduce complexity has played out in enterprise and service providers. Going forward in 2019, we're very excited about 2 stand-alone security use cases. The first one is our advanced web application firewall, where we've already release that product and we're seeing great initial traction. We're really differentiated relative to other players up because of our several capabilities, but also bot litigation capabilities, and that differentiation today is on-prem, but we're going to bring our capability into a service and considered to be a big differentiator for us. And then the second one we are very excited about is our SSL orchestration capability. So use case because all enterprise customers are dealing with the vast majority of their traffic is encrypted and we provide a very efficient solution to encrypt and decrypt the traffic to what we call break and inspect and then chain multiple security services together with sales very significant dollars to enterprise customers. So these 2 areas, Tal, we expect them to be 2 meaningful growth drivers for us in stand-alone security next year. And if you recall, that was one of our growth pillars from the cover station at in March."

The Americas were flat and they have been flat to slow single-digit in the reason for last several quarters. Asia-Pac is 11%, following 8% growth in preceding quarter and Japan is 11% following 4% in Q3. Some of that maybe easy comps than the later 2. But my question is, look at the regions, what counts for the differences? Do you think from an economic perspective with U.S. having up and EMEA much less so, so it's counterintuitive.

So the -- there are 2 -- you are correct that both application developers and their close cousins, DevOps people are gaining mind share and influencing enterprise organizations, that's resulting into 2 things. First, for our traditional buyers, Network Infrastructure, typically in central IT, they want to offer a better SLA to app developers and DevOps people. And so part of our portfolio strategy, our multi-cloud strategy is to current buyers to offer that better SLA. Cloud Edition, I just discussed earlier was exactly that. It offers this per app capability, which means an app developer doesn't have to wait for a maintenance window so that all applications can aligned to an upgrade, they can do their thing on their part, on their infrastructure. We also get more analytics and get more capability in their. But that Cloud Edition is typically purchased by a network of operations percent and they use that technology to offer a different SLA to app developers. So that's kind of motion 1. The solutions that we're releasing in 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud-native Applications Services platform, those will appeal directly to the DevOps buyer. And they will allow them to essentially procure their own technology on their terms and so associated with that, we have a significant efforts around digital marketing, digital sales, our tech attached for these buyers that essentially allow them to procure, explore trial and procure the technology in the way they want to it, which is very different than our traditional buyers currently. So that's how we will address that community as well, but that journey starts in 2019."

Great, Simon. So let's start, so today, there are applications we don't support, that are typically applications that are board in the cloud either in development are either in production and that I would say have a relatively simple balancing requirements. Doors applications are largely addressed by native load balances offered by cloud public providers. So that's where they play and today, we largely play in enterprises that have either on-prem requirements are multi-cloud the deployment requirement. So if somebody wants to deploy an application or portfolios application in multiple public clouds, typically we are going to have to play there because we are cloud agnostic. We will in that scenario partner with the public cloud providers to help the customers migrate their application to these environments. And when F5 is supporting application on-prem and it migrate in a vast vast majority of the cases we will stay with that application and they will stay with us. So that's kind of the lay of the land today. In 2019, as we introduce our new platform in F5 as a Service, we will also play in bonding the cloud applications. But the value that we bring beyond Cloud-Native balances is the future depth and breadth that a lot of these applications want, global server load balancing, some server security capability and our partners in risks and uncertainties cloud providers are actually interested in partnering with us to enable these capabilities in their environment in a seamless way for these applications. And that's actually one of the reasons that I mentioned in the that Barry and have joined us from AWS, one of the reasons for that is they have deep insights, both into the economics of application, public to public cloud and the technology associated with the deployment and they're very interested in this multi-cloud strategy and how we're going to deploy our business in this environment."

Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we executed and overachieved our 2018 plan and continue to align to Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 goals, driving growth and strong operational results across the business during the fourth quarter. We are seeing significant traction for the long-term vision we outlined in our March 2018 Analyst and Investor Day, and furthering momentum in software and security sales. Customers continued to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments, as they deploy incremental workloads, dynamically both on premises and in cloud environments. 
Our product revenue growth continued in Q4 with products delivering 3% growth led by software. Public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area with an increasing demand for security solutions. We expect our cloud native offerings will allow us to extend our growth and expand our public cloud reach in 2019. 
In addition, we continue to see strong customer response to our recently launched ELA and Virtual Edition subscription consumption models. Good initial deal closure and strong pipeline growth indicates these new consumption model will be especially important with our new cloud offerings, including BIG-IP Cloud Edition. 
Systems continued to show resilience with growth opportunities in certain geographies, including China and Latin America, and with customers that want to control and manage the end-to-end application delivery solution and certain high-performance use cases.
Rounding out the business drivers, our Services business continues to perform well, delivering 6% growth in the quarter. We are seeing consistently strong attach rates on maintenance and driving continued year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We're particularly proud of our continued world-class customer satisfaction scores, reflecting our relentless commitment to our customers and their increasingly complex application deployments.

As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $5",1100,"Thank you, François. As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $565 million. GAAP EPS of $2.18 per share was well above our guidance of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 per share was also well above our guidance of $2.61 to $2.64 per share. The beats for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were driven largely by strength in revenue, expense discipline and lower-than-expected effective tax rates. 
Q4 product revenue of $256 million, was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. Software was approximately 17% of product revenue and grew more than 19% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 83% of product revenue and grew 18 basis points year-over-year. Services revenue of $306 million, grew 6% year-over-year, and represented approximately 54% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis in Q4, Americas grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 25% of overall revenue. APAC revenue grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 15% of total revenue, while Japan grew 15% year-over-year and accounted for 5% of total revenue. Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 16%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
In Q4, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue, Tech Data, which accounted for 11% and Westcon and Arrow, each at 10%. 
Let's now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strengths in services margin, as we continue to leverage automation to optimize our support organization. Last quarter, we took steps to further align investment with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we are accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest-growing opportunities of our business in cloud and security. As a result, we took $20.9 million in restructuring and facility exit charges during Q4, which are reflected in our GAAP results.
GAAP operating expenses of $316 million were below our $317 million to $329 million guided range, driven largely by operating efficiency and lower-than-expected restructuring expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were within our guided range at $263 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 27.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% lower than anticipated, due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.3%.
GAAP and non-GAAP effective rates also benefited from year-end adjustments related to our domestic tax filings as well as our mix of profits and lower tax rate jurisdictions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.45 billion at year-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 47 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.4 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 5.3% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. 
On employees, our restructuring initiative in Q4 impacted approximately 215 employees. Executing on our plan to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, during the quarter, we hired 150 employees and ended the quarter with approximately 4,410 employees, down approximately 65 people from Q3.  We continue to hire aggressively in our growth areas. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 864,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $173.69 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Quickly recapping our fiscal year results. For the full year, total revenue grew 3.4% to $2.16 billion. Product revenue of $960 million decreased 0.5% from the prior year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Within product revenue, software revenue grew 23%, while systems revenue declined 4% over the same period. Services revenue of $1.2 billion grew approximately 6.7% during the year and represented 56% of the total. GAAP net income for FY '18 was $454 million or $7.32 per share and non-GAAP net income was $612 million or $9.87 per share. In FY '18, cash flow from operations totaled $761 million and capital expenditures were $53 million.
Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q1 of FY '19. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Overall, we remain confident in our position in the market and in the growth opportunities for the business with solid software momentum. We believe the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environment is strong and will be a fundamental growth driver for the solutions we offer today and those we will launch in 2019. With this in mind as well as factoring in our normal seasonality, for the first quarter of FY '19, we are targeting revenue in the range of $542 million to $552 million.
We expect gross margins at or around 85%. We estimate operating expenses of $265 million to $277 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be between 21% and 22% with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.51 to $2.54 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $39 million and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with broad modeling assumptions for FY '19 fiscal year. 
As we discussed in March at our investor conference, we are tracking to Horizon 1 outlook with our FY '19 operating plan. For FY '19, from the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We anticipate gross margins at or around 85% for the year. We expect operating margin in the mid-30s range, in line with recent years results, moving down slightly in Q2 and Q3 from Q1 and then in Q4 in the upper 30s. 
Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in a range of $155 million to $165 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million in cost related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in downtown Seattle, as we ready the space for occupancy this year. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

I'll spend a few minutes highlighting some customer wins and use cases from the quarter. Then I'll conclude our prepared remarks with comments about drivers for fiscal 2019 and our evolution to a multi-cloud application services company. The first customer win I'll talk to spotlight's F5 role in network function virtualization. During the quarter, a large Tier 1 service provider selected F5 in an initial 5G VNS deployment based on overall performance in our Virtual Edition platform's ability to consolidate various functions within the core. Importantly, the customer expects to use this as the baseline for the future virtualized core designs. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we continue to see good acceptance of our new ELA and subscription consumption models, which are another element of F5's multi-cloud value proposition, offering customers insurance against the uncertainties associated with cloud deployment, including providing timeline flexibility. 
Another example, we secured an ELA deal in Q4 with a North American healthcare infrastructure provider, who provides a Software-as-a-Service offering. An existing F5 customer, this customer required the same level of F5 application services they had on-prem as they moved to the public cloud.
The ELA structure was important because it provided the agility they needed, as they scaled their offerings over time. An added bonus, F5's ability to provide multiple services enabled the customer to consolidate several security elements of their existing infrastructure. 
Turning to our security offerings. Advanced Web Application Firewall or Advanced WAF continues on a solid growth trajectory. F5's Advanced WAF provides a powerful set of security features that keep web applications safe from attack. In 1 deployment during the quarter, we replaced the competitor in a Virtual Edition software environment, specifically because of our bot detection and litigation capabilities. We were also deployed by a managed care provider who is moving to the public cloud to reduce the time to turn up new customer applications. We worked with the customer to move critical applications from shared F5 appliances through dedicated high-performance Virtual Editions, extending the same on-prem policy to their cloud deployments and replace the application security manager or ASM with Advanced WAF on the existing F5 appliances, while deploying Virtual Editions with Advanced WAF to support new applications in the public cloud. This customer will also deploy our BIG-IP Cloud Edition
to support new apps going into the public cloud.
And these are just a few examples of wins the sales teams is driving. Let me close our remarks today with some thoughts about fiscal 2019. Last quarter, we spoke to our efforts to repurpose investment to focus on growth areas and ensure our product development and sales efforts were aligned with our most significant growth opportunities. As Frank noted, we're adding resources in priority areas and extending our software portfolio and stand-alone security products. As a result, we've got several new drivers to move toward in fiscal 2019. One of these drivers is our BIG-IP Cloud Edition, a bundle of our BIG-IP centralized managed solution and BIG-IP Virtual Edition sold on a per-app basis. Cloud Edition helps us address a large subset of applications by reducing the total cost of ownership of providing application services, while providing more application's management. We have strong conviction that Cloud Edition is addressing new use cases and will be instrumental in expanding our multi-cloud platform strategy. While not yet a material contributor to our revenue, the platform's ability to provide a single management console for both on-prem and cloud application services is resonating strongly with customers and the regional demand we saw for the product immediately following its release in April 2018, has now turned global.
We are seeing strong interest and demand across all our territories, and we expect sales activity to increase in fiscal 2019, as we build customer references. 
In our security portfolio, we've got a new stand-alone version of SSL Orchestrator scheduled for release in December. The amount of SSL traffic is growing rapidly, requiring customers to use significant resources to greater inspect for security purposes.  F5's SSL Orchestrator has gained strong traction as a solution on a range of F5 platforms and we expect its availability as a stand-alone product to enable increased penetration with security buyers. Designed to optimize customers' SSL infrastructure by providing security devices with highly efficient visibility of SSL-encrypted traffic, it also supports policy-based management and stealing of traffic through existing security devices through service training. This makes it easy to integrate into existing architectures, enabling customers to easily apply corporate security controls to all their encrypted traffic. We are already building a strong pipeline for the stand-alone SSL Orchestrator offering, particularly with enterprise and government customers, and the sales team is very excited about the opportunity to drive additional growth in new buying centers.
We are also making good progress with both our F5 as a Service and cloud native platforms. When we spoke about F5 as a Service at our Analyst and Investor event in March of 2018, we said, we expected to launch in 2019. At this point, I'm pleased to say we are on track for first commercial availability in the first half of calendar 2019, and are starting to build pilots for lighthouse customers. In concert, we are working internally to build the muscle that will enable us to target the expanded customers set we expect this product would appeal to. Our internal digital transformation efforts, include expanding our digital touch motion to ensure frictionless procurement and service renewals. 
At the March Investor event, we also highlighted the investment we're making to deliver Cloud-Native Applications Services in FY '19. This program is also on track for launch in the first half of calendar 2019. Our innovation teams have built out functionality that enables intelligent traffic management services and an API-first interaction model across select private and public clouds. I have seen the product demos, and I am looking forward to sharing more, as we progress with our efforts to unlock native demand through lighter weight offerings optimized for CI/CD workflows. 
In addition to pushing forward with our multi-cloud focus solution set, we're also building our public cloud expertise. I am pleased to announce that Barry Russell has joined F5 from AWS to succeed Chad Whalen in leading our cloud sales team. Barry is a business development, sales and operational leader, who brings us 20-plus years of experience. Most recently, Barry was General Manager of Global Business Development and Field Operations for the AWS Marketplace and Service Catalog, where he built the AWS Marketplace ISV ecosystem, and digital software catalog. Barry's prior leadership roles include business development and service provider sales leadership at Microsoft as well as a role at Nivio and Level 3 Communications and we're very excited to have him on board to further F5's expansion into multi-cloud opportunities globally.
Barry joins another former AWS colleague, Venu Aravamudan, who joined F5 in fiscal 2018 to lead our F5 as a Service business. Venu is a seasoned software executive and expert in cloud computing with leadership experience spanning product development, product management, program management and product and solution marketing. His leading-edge experience with public cloud services and infrastructure platforms, services development, deployment and operation and enterprise IT transformation to cloud made him ideal to lead our F5 as a Service program. Prior to joining F5 in 2018, Venu was General Manager in the Amazon Relational Database Services business unit and previously held leadership roles at Limelight Networks, VMware and Microsoft. We're excited to have both Barry and Venu's cloud expertise at F5. 
In closing, I'd reiterate that we are making meaningful progress toward our long-term vision for F5 with continued momentum in software and security solutions. My thanks to the entire F5 team and our partners for the progress we've made. As a team, we're excited about the year ahead, and we look forward to reporting on our continued progress in fiscal 2019.

So the first thing, Rod, on software, I'd tell you, no, you should not read anything into the 19%. I am very excited about where we're at on software generally and where we're going into 2019. The context for the Q4 19% is, first of all, software as a percentage of overall revenue is still relatively small. And so as I shared in last quarter, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but the general trends are going to be what we've said. We -- specifically for this quarter, we had a tough compared to Q4 of 2017, which was a big software quarter. I think that's part of what you're seeing in this growth rate that's a little less than last quarter. But if you look overall, in Q4, 17% was -- sorry, software was 17% of product revenue, so we're up from 15% in prior quarters. And as a percentage of the mix, we're on trajectory to achieve our Horizon 1 goals. I said, I'm very excited for where we're at on software and that's because of what I foresee is going to be happening in 2019. So at our analyst conference, we said, we would be in Horizon 1, which was 2019 and 2020, we said we will see software growth that would be in the 30% to 35% range. And I feel confident we're going to be in that range. We've got a lot of things driving software growth in 2019. First of all, I'll point to just 3 of them. First of all, we're seeing really good momentum on our ELAs, these enterprise license agreements. They're driving a larger deal size and they're also allowing us to expand our use cases and start to take footprint for either -- from either cloud native or different open source of virtual ADC competitors with these new model of consumption. So that's going to drive growth in software. Our Cloud Edition is ramping very well from the first 4 months we've had in the market. So we expect a meaningful contribution of Cloud Edition in 2019. And as you probably heard from the script, we also have new products that are coming now in the first half of 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform. So we've got very good drivers in '19, and I expect, we're going to be in the range that we've discussed for Horizon 1. Frank, on the China?"

The new Cloud Edition on a per unit basis is a fraction of the price of the Virtual Edition, but remember that a Virtual Edition typically support anywhere between 5 and 10 applications, and a Cloud Edition is bought on a per application basis. And so what we're seeing in the initial deals that we've done on Cloud Edition is that the number of apps that are supported is significant. And so overall, there is no impact on the deal size. It's about the same deal size as what it's been on Virtual Editions.

The -- we have a lot of customers that are buying traditional hardware motion and are adding to that Virtual Editions on -- Virtual Editions on-prem, that's kind of a classic deployment model. What we're seeing is more and more these customers also want to deploy their infrastructure in multiple public clouds. And their desire is to manage all these instances of ADCs as part of a single portfolio and ideally through a single pane of glass. Our ELAs enable them to do that and give them the flexibility to consume as many licenses as they want of software, and whether they put these licenses on-prem or in the public cloud. The initial -- I'm talking about software purely right now. The initial view we're seeing from the consumption of these ELAs is very strong, i.e. they signed up for a minimum amount of consumption and we're seeing in the early months of consumption that they're well on track to exceed that minimal amount of consumption, which bodes well for true-up in the future. What we've seen as it relates to hardware is that generally customers that use us in a multi-cloud deployment scenario overall spend more with us than customers that use us just in a traditional hardware deployment models. And so that's, I think, how I would frame it for you is the overall spend for multi-cloud customer is larger than one that is not or the one that is to your hardware."

I would say the contribution to Q4 was very minimal, because there is -- the time it takes to get through -- go through the sales cycle, the proof-of-concepts et cetera, and then a lot of the initial views or initial sales, which will expand over time. So minimal contribution in '18, but we do expect -- given the traction that we've seen so far, we do expect meaningful contribution in fiscal '19. In terms of the gross margin, yes, the answer is no different than what we've sort of aimed that overtime, we do expect the software contribution grow is to have some impact on our -- positive, in fact, on our gross margin. If you recall, at the end of our Horizon 2, which is 2022, we expect that our software to be about 40% of total product revenues. I think by then, we would see meaningful impact. That being said, our margins are roughly 85% right now. And so the room for expansion isn't significant. What we said is that in Horizon 2, our margins would be in the 85% to 87% range, so it's incremental, but small in the big scheme of things."

We're winning new use cases in security, in public cloud, and even I mentioned last quarter, a number of new customers coming in for hardware. So new customer and new logo acquisitions is going to continue. What we're seeing with Cloud Edition is, within our existing customers, we are unlocking new footprint that we didn't have before. There are a couple of use cases that we could not address before. One is, when customers want to really deploy on a per-app basis, we couldn't touch those types of deployments, we now can. And two, is the ability to scale rapidly the infrastructure under an application, that sort of flexibility is a new use case for us and its expanding our footprint and touching new application, specifically applications that are in test and development. We didn't have the opportunity before to intercept these applications at their inception, and now we can. And the third aspect of that is, we are also now for the first time giving application developers direct visibility into their virtual instance of F5. And they are seeing analytics and the performance of their applications, and so we're building a relationship with that developers that we didn't have before and that's driving new deployments into new applications. So I would characterize it right now as largely addressing the long tail of applications you heard us talk about inside of existing customers more than focusing on going and looking out for new customers. I do think though we will address new customer segments, as we introduce in the first half of '19 F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform."

And I think what you've seen over the last 3 quarters is we've done exactly that. In this quarter, we were flat. And we still expect quarterly fluctuations on the hardware number, but overall, we're executing as per the plan and I think we're getting share. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One, driver of this stability is security use cases driving spend in ADC for us, that's not all ADC vendors have access to it because they don't have the security capabilities, things like SSL Orchestration or web application firewall or Access Manager consolidated on ADC, that's driving stability for us in ADC. There are new use cases, such as steps in the federal sector or IoT that are driving demand for our hardware products. There are geographies where there is significant demand for new hardware, specifically in the emerging markets, places like China and Latin America. And so all of these factors are driving stability in the hardware business along the lines of what we had said would happen at the Investor Meeting."

And as they grow and start to worry a bit more about their profit, they start worrying about how they control their cost. And we have seen some of them almost graduate from this born in the cloud environment and come back and ran colocation capabilities and actually come back to us for hardware ADCs. So we have seen those cases. I don't know this was a trend that's going to be much stronger in the future than it is today, but we are seeing that. But as it relates to and acquiring customers directly in the cloud for companies that were historically on-prem like us, we think it's an opportunity that largely for us is on top because you're right, we don't play in that market today. But that's why we are quite excited about F5 as a Service coming in the first half of '19 because that's going to allow us to really intercept these bot in the cloud applications in a native cloud consumption experience for those who are building their app in the public cloud's platform environment. And so we're pretty excited about our opportunity to play there and intercept these application. And then, down the road, as these applications grow, if they too have multi-cloud requirements, it will make it that much easier for us to contribute to their requirements beyond the single public cloud. And so F5 as a Service essentially will be our leading entry into the relationship, which we will expand from."

And so that's the reason that we don't break it out today and there is not a clear trigger of when we will. In terms of your -- and I'll take the third part of your question then the second one.  Where we have been seeing very strong success today, historically, and Tal, I would say that would be up until kind of the middle of 2018 was really in these consolidated use case, where we -- is very convenient for a lot of our enterprise customers to consolidate onto an ADC application firewall, identity and access capability, some encryption, decryption capabilities. And so this use case of consolidation in the ADC and the enterprise has been extremely successful, while continued to be, that is also true in the service provider world where our capabilities around CGNAT, CCP optimization, carrier-grade firewalls, consolidated into an ADC capability is very appealing to service providers. So I would say, if you look historically, the consolidation of multiple security modules and function that allows 1 to reduce CapEx and reduce complexity has played out in the enterprise and service providers. Going forward in 2019, we're very excited about 2 stand-alone security use cases. The first one is our advanced web application firewall, where we've already released that product and we're seeing great initial traction. And we're really differentiated relative to other players because of our Layer 7 capabilities, but also bot litigation capabilities, and that differentiation today is on-prem, and -- but we're going to bring our WAF capabilities into a F5 as a Service and we think that's going to be a big differentiator for us. And then the second one we're very excited about is our SSL Orchestration capability. So mid mass use case because all enterprise customers are dealing with. The vast majority of their traffic is encrypted and we provide a very efficient solution to encrypt and decrypt the traffic to what we call break and inspect and then chain multiple security services together, which saves very significant dollars to an enterprise customers. So these 2 areas, Tal, we expect them to be 2 meaningful growth drivers for us in stand-alone security next year.

François, to what extent, historically, if we go back to the dawn of what was in balancing back in the late 90s, which you guys pioneered along with a couple of others, and we fast-forward to today, historically, you also sold to the networking side of the IT organization with enterprise. And over time, and it's an ongoing, but the locus of purchasing power seems to be shifting, seems to be in progress. To what extent do you all have an issue? And if you do, to what extent you're addressing it? And separate from Tal's security question, in terms of addressing the application developers who have increasing power in that equation in terms of making the purchasing decisions. You already have the mindshare? Or do you need to do meaningful work in terms of gaining the mindshare among that community?"

So the -- there are 2 -- you are correct that both application developers and their close cousin, DevOps people are gaining mindshare and influence in large enterprise organizations. That's resulting into 2 things. First, for our traditional buyers, Network Infrastructure, that is typically in central IT, they want to offer a better SLA to app developers and DevOps people. And so part of our portfolio strategy, our multi-cloud strategy is to enable to our current buyers to offer that better SLAs. Cloud Edition, just -- I just discussed earlier, does exactly that. It offer this per-app capability, which means an app developer doesn't have to wait for a maintenance window for 5 weeks so that all applications can align to an upgrade. They can do their thing on their part, on their infrastructure. We also get more analytics and got more visibility in their application. But that Cloud Edition is typically purchased by a network operation's person and they use that new technology to offer a different SLA to app developers. So that's kind of motion 1. The solutions we're releasing in 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native application platform, those will appeal directly to the DevOps buyer. And they will allow them to essentially procure their own technology on their terms. And so associated with that, we have a significant efforts around digital marketing, digital sales, and a tech touch for these buyers that essentially allow them to procure the -- to trial and explore trial and procure the technology in the way they want to do it, which is very different than our traditional buyers currently. So that's how we will address that community as well, but that journey starts in 2019."

Great, Simon. So let's start. So today, there are applications we don't support, that are typically applications that are born in the cloud either in test or development or either in production and that I would say have relatively simple load balancing requirements. Those applications are largely addressed by the native load balancers offered by the large public cloud providers. And now in -- so that's where they play. And today, we largely play in enterprises that have either on-prem requirements or multi-cloud deployment requirements. So if somebody wants to deploy an application or a portfolio of applications in multiple public clouds, typically, we're going to have to play there because we are cloud agnostic. And we will in that scenario partner with the public cloud providers to help the customers migrate their application to these environments. And when F5 is supporting an application on-prem and it migrates, in the vast, vast, vast majority of the cases, we will stay with that application and they will stay with us. Now in -- so that's kind of the lay of the land today. In 2019, as we introduce our new platforms in F5 as a Service, we will also play in born in the cloud applications. But the value that we bring beyond the cloud native load balances is the future depth and breadth that a lot of these applications want, when they want global server load balancing, some security capability. And our partners in this case, the cloud providers are actually interested in partnering with us to enable these capabilities in their environment in a seamless way for these applications. And that's actually one of the reasons that I mentioned in the script earlier, that Barry and Venu have joined us from AWS. One of the reasons for that is, they have deep insights, both into the economics of application, public to public cloud and the technology associated with the deployment and they're very interested in this multi-cloud strategy and how we're going to deploy our business in these environments."

Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we executed and overachieved our 2018 plan and continue to align to our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 goals, driving growth and strong operational results across the business during the fourth quarter. We are seeing significant traction for the long-term vision we outlined in our March 2018 Analyst and Investor Day, and furthering momentum in software and security sales. Customers continued to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments, as they deploy incremental workloads, dynamically both on premises and in cloud environments. 
Our product revenue growth continued in Q4 with products delivering 3% growth led by software. Public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area with an increasing demand for security solutions. We expect our cloud native offerings will allow us to extend our growth and expand our public cloud reach in 2019. 
In addition, we continued to see strong customer response to our recently launched ELA and Virtual Edition subscription consumption models. Good initial deal closure and strong pipeline growth indicates these new consumption models will be especially important with our new cloud offerings, including BIG-IP Cloud Edition. 
Systems continued to show resilience with growth opportunities in certain geographies, including China and Latin America, and with customers that want to control and manage the end-to-end application delivery solution and certain high-performance use cases.
Rounding out the business drivers, our Services business continues to perform well, delivering 6% growth in the quarter. We are seeing consistently strong attach rates on maintenance and driving continued year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We're particularly proud of our continued world-class customer satisfaction scores, reflecting our relentless commitment to our customers and their increasingly complex application deployments. I will speak more on some of the customer wins and use cases in the quarter later in our prepared remarks.

As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $5",1100,"Thank you, François. As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $565 million. GAAP EPS of $2.18 per share was well above our guidance of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 per share was also well above our guidance of $2.61 to $2.64 per share. The beats for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were driven largely by strength in revenue, expense discipline and lower-than-expected effective tax rates. 
Q4 product revenue of $256 million, was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. Software was approximately 17% of product revenue and grew more than 19% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 83% of product revenue and grew 18 basis points year-over-year. Services revenue of $306 million, grew 6% year-over-year, and represented approximately 54% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis in Q4, Americas grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 25% of overall revenue. APAC revenue grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 15% of total revenue, while Japan grew 15% year-over-year and accounted for 5% of total revenue. Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 16%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
In Q4, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue, Tech Data, which accounted for 11% and Westcon and Arrow, each at 10%. 
Let's now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strengths in services margin, as we continue to leverage automation to optimize our support organization. Last quarter, we took steps to further align investment with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we are accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest-growing opportunities of our business; cloud and security. As a result, we took $20.9 million in restructuring and facility exit charges during Q4, which are reflected in our GAAP results.
GAAP operating expenses of $316 million were below our $317 million to $329 million guided range, driven largely by operating efficiency and lower-than-expected restructuring expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were within our guided range at $263 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 27.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% lower than anticipated, due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.3%.
GAAP and non-GAAP effective rates also benefited from year-end adjustments related to our domestic tax filings as well as our mix of profits and lower tax rate jurisdictions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.45 billion at year-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 47 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.4 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 5.3% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. 
On employees, our restructuring initiative in Q4 impacted approximately 215 employees. Executing on our plan to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, during the quarter, we hired 150 employees and ended the quarter with approximately 4,410 employees, down approximately 65 people from Q3.  We continue to hire aggressively in our growth areas. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 864,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $173.69 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Quickly recapping our fiscal year results. For the full year, total revenue grew 3.4% to $2.16 billion. Product revenue of $960 million decreased 0.5% from the prior year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Within product revenue, software revenue grew 23%, while systems revenue declined 4% over the same period. Services revenue of $1.2 billion grew approximately 6.7% during the year and represented 56% of the total. GAAP net income for FY '18 was $454 million or $7.32 per share and non-GAAP net income was $612 million or $9.87 per share. In FY '18, cash flow from operations totaled $761 million and capital expenditures were $53 million.
Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q1 of FY '19. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Overall, we remain confident in our position in the market and in the growth opportunities for the business with solid software momentum. We believe the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environment is strong and will be a fundamental growth driver for the solutions we offer today and those we will launch in 2019. With this in mind, as well as factoring in our normal seasonality, for the first quarter of FY '19, we are targeting revenue in the range of $542 million to $552 million.
We expect gross margins at or around 85%. We estimate operating expenses of $265 million to $277 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be between 21% and 22% with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.51 to $2.54 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $39 million and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with broad modeling assumptions for FY '19 fiscal year. 
As we discussed in March at our investor conference, we are tracking to our Horizon 1 outlook with our FY '19 operating plan. For FY '19, from the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We anticipate gross margins at or around 85% for the year. We expect operating margin in the mid-30s range, in line with recent years results, moving down slightly in Q2 and Q3 from Q1 and then in Q4 in the upper 30s. 
Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in a range of $155 million to $165 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million in cost related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in downtown Seattle, as we ready the space for occupancy this year. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

I'll spend a few minutes highlighting some customer wins and use cases from the quarter. Then I'll conclude our prepared remarks with comments about drivers for fiscal 2019 and our evolution to a multi-cloud application services company. The first customer win I'll talk to spotlights F5 role in network function virtualization. During the quarter, a large Tier 1 service provider selected F5 in an initial 5G VNS deployment based on overall performance in our Virtual Edition platform's ability to consolidate various functions within the core. Importantly, the customer expects to use this as the baseline for the future virtualized core designs. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we continue to see good acceptance of our new ELA and subscription consumption models, which are another element of F5's multi-cloud value proposition, offering customers insurance against the uncertainties associated with cloud deployment, including providing timeline flexibility. 
As an example, we secured an ELA deal in Q4 with a North American healthcare infrastructure provider, who provides a Software-as-a-Service offering. An existing F5 customer, this customer required the same level of F5 application services they had on-prem as they moved to the public cloud.
The ELA structure was important because it provided the agility they needed, as they scaled their offerings over time. An added bonus, F5's ability to provide multiple services enabled the customer to consolidate several security elements on their existing infrastructure. 
Turning to our security offerings. Advanced Web Application Firewall or Advanced WAF continues on a solid growth trajectory. F5's Advanced WAF provides a powerful set of security features that keep web applications safe from attack. In 1 deployment during the quarter, we replaced the competitor in a Virtual Edition software environment, specifically because of our bot detection and litigation capabilities. We were also deployed by a managed care provider who is moving to the public cloud to reduce the time to turn up new customer applications. We worked with the customer to move critical applications from shared F5 appliances through dedicated high-performance Virtual Editions, extending the same on-prem policy to their cloud deployments and replacing the application security manager or ASM with Advanced WAF on the existing F5 appliances, while deploying Virtual Editions with Advanced WAF to support new applications in the public cloud. This customer will also deploy our BIG-IP Cloud Edition
to support new apps going into the public cloud.
And these are just a few examples of wins the sales team is driving. Let me close our remarks today with some thoughts about fiscal 2019. Last quarter, we spoke to our efforts to repurpose investment to focus on growth areas and ensure our product development and sales efforts were aligned with our most significant growth opportunities. As Frank noted, we're adding resources in priority areas and extending our software portfolio and stand-alone security products. As a result, we've got several new drivers to move toward in fiscal 2019. One of these drivers is our BIG-IP Cloud Edition, a bundle of our BIG-IP centralized managed solution and BIG-IP Virtual Edition sold on a per-app basis. Cloud Edition helps us address a large subset of applications by reducing the total cost of ownership of providing application services, while providing more application's management. We have strong conviction that Cloud Edition is addressing new use cases and will be instrumental in expanding our multi-cloud platform strategy. While not yet a material contributor to our revenue, the platform's ability to provide a single management console for both on-prem and cloud application services is resonating strongly with customers and the regional demand we saw for the product immediately following its release in April 2018, has now turned global.
We are seeing strong interest and demand across all our territories, and we expect sales activity to increase in fiscal 2019, as we build customer references. 
In our security portfolio, we've got a new stand-alone version of SSL Orchestrator scheduled for release in December. The amount of SSL traffic is growing rapidly, requiring customers to use significant resources to greater inspect for security purposes.  F5's SSL Orchestrator has gained strong traction as a solution on a range of F5 platforms and we expect its availability as a stand-alone product to enable increased penetration with security buyers. Designed to optimize customers' SSL infrastructure by providing security devices with highly efficient visibility of SSL-encrypted traffic, it also supports policy-based management and stealing of traffic through existing security devices through service training. This makes it easy to integrate into existing architectures, enabling customers to easily apply corporate security controls to all their encrypted traffic. We are already building a strong pipeline for the stand-alone SSL Orchestrator offering, particularly with enterprise and government customers, and the sales team is very excited about the opportunity to drive additional growth in new buying centers.
We are also making good progress with both our F5 as a Service and cloud native platforms. When we spoke about F5 as a Service at our Analyst and Investor event in March of 2018, we said, we expected to launch in 2019. At this point, I'm pleased to say we are on track for first commercial availability in the first half of calendar 2019, and are starting to build pilots for lighthouse customers. In concert, we are working internally to build the muscle that will enable us to target the expanded customers set we expect this product would appeal to. Our internal digital transformation efforts, include expanding our digital touch motion to ensure frictionless procurement and service renewals. 
At the March Investor event, we also highlighted the investment we're making to deliver Cloud-Native Applications Services in FY '19. This program is also on track for launch in the first half of calendar 2019. Our innovation teams have built out functionality that enables intelligent traffic management services and an API-first interaction model across select private and public clouds. I have seen the product demos, and I am looking forward to sharing more, as we progress with our efforts to unlock latent demand through lighter weight offerings optimized for CI/CD workflows. 
In addition to pushing forward with our multi-cloud focus solution set, we're also building our public cloud expertise. I am pleased to announce that Barry Russell has joined F5 from AWS to succeed Chad Whalen in leading our cloud sales team. Barry is a business development, sales and operational leader, who brings us 20-plus years of experience. Most recently, Barry was General Manager of Global Business Development and Field Operations for the AWS Marketplace and Service Catalog, where he built the AWS Marketplace ISV ecosystem, and digital software catalog. Barry's prior leadership roles include business development and service provider sales leadership at Microsoft as well as a role at Nivio and Level 3 Communications and we're very excited to have him on board to further F5's expansion into multi-cloud opportunities globally.
Barry joins another former AWS colleague, Venu Aravamudan, who joined F5 in fiscal 2018 to lead our F5 as a Service business. Venu is a seasoned software executive and expert in cloud computing with leadership experience spanning product development, product management, program management and product and solution marketing. His leading-edge experience with public cloud services and infrastructure platforms, services development, deployment and operation and enterprise IT transformation to cloud made him ideal to lead our F5 as a Service program. Prior to joining F5 in 2018, Venu was General Manager in the Amazon Relational Database Services business unit and previously held leadership roles at Limelight Networks, VMware and Microsoft. We're excited to have both Barry and Venu's cloud expertise at F5. 
In closing, I'd reiterate that we are making meaningful progress toward our long-term vision for F5 with continued momentum in software and security solutions. My thanks to the entire F5 team and our partners for the progress we've made. As a team, we're excited about the year ahead, and we look forward to reporting on our continued progress in fiscal 2019.

So the first thing, Rod, on software, I'd tell you, no, you should not read anything into the 19%. I am very excited about where we're at on software generally and where we're going into 2019. The context for the Q4 19% is, first of all, software as a percentage of overall revenue is still relatively small. And so as I shared in last quarter, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but the general trends are going to be what we've said. We -- specifically for this quarter, we had it tough compared to Q4 of 2017, which was a big software quarter. I think that's part of what you're seeing in this growth rate that's a little less than last quarter. But if you look overall, in Q4, 17% was -- sorry, software was 17% of product revenue, so we're up from 15% in prior quarters. And as a percentage of the mix, we're on trajectory to achieve our Horizon 1 goals. I said, I'm very excited for where we're at on software and that's because of what I foresee is going to be happening in 2019. So at our analyst conference, we said, we would be, in Horizon 1, which was 2019 and 2020, we said we will see software growth that would be in the 30% to 35% range. And I feel confident we're going to be in that range. We've got a lot of things driving software growth in 2019. First of all, I'll point to just 3 of them. First of all, we're seeing really good momentum on our ELAs, these enterprise license agreements. They're driving a larger deal size and they're also allowing us to expand our use cases and start to take footprint for either -- from either cloud native or different open source of virtual ADC competitors with these new model of consumption. So that's going to drive growth in software. Our Cloud Edition is ramping very well from the first 4 months we've had in the market. So we expect a meaningful contribution of Cloud Edition in 2019. And as you probably heard from the script, we also have new products that are coming now in the first half of 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform. So we've got very good drivers in '19, and I expect, we're going to be in the range that we've discussed for Horizon 1. Frank, on the China?"

But the new Cloud Edition on a per unit basis is a fraction of the price of the Virtual Edition, but remember that a Virtual Edition typically support anywhere between 5 and 10 applications, and a Cloud Edition is bought on a per application basis. And so what we're seeing in the initial deals that we've done on Cloud Edition is that the number of apps that are supported is significant. And so overall, there is no impact on the deal size. It's about the same deal size as what it's been on Virtual Editions. It's just a different consumption model that allows more flexibility for the user to manage their infrastructure on a per-app basis."

The -- we have a lot of customers that are buying traditional hardware motion and are adding to that Virtual Editions on -- Virtual Editions on-prem, that's kind of a classic deployment model. What we're seeing is more and more these customers also want to deploy their infrastructure in multiple public clouds. And their desire is to manage all these instances of ADCs as part of a single portfolio and ideally through a single pane of glass. Our ELAs enable them to do that and give them the flexibility to consume as many licenses as they want of software, and whether they put these licenses on-prem or in the public cloud. The initial -- I'm talking about software purely right now. The initial view we're seeing from the consumption of these ELAs is very strong, i.e. they signed up for a minimum amount of consumption and we're seeing in the early months of consumption that they're well on track to exceed that minimal amount of consumption, which bodes well for true-up in the future. What we've seen as it relates to hardware is that generally customers that use us in a multi-cloud deployment scenario overall spend more with us than customers that use us just in a traditional hardware deployment models. And so that's, I think, how I would frame it for you is the overall spend for a multi-cloud customer is larger than one that is not -- or the one that is to pure hardware."

In terms of the gross margins, yes, the answer is no different than what we've sort of aimed that over time we do expect the software contribution grows to have some impact on our -- positive impact on our gross margins. If you recall, at the end of our Horizon 2, which is 2022, we expected our software to be about 40% of total product revenues. I think by then, we would see meaningful impact.

So new customer and new logo acquisitions is going to continue. What we're seeing with Cloud Edition is, within our existing customers, we are unlocking new footprint that we didn't have before. There are a couple of use cases that we could not address before. One is, when customers want to really deploy on a per-app basis, we couldn't touch those types of deployments, we now can. And two, is the ability to scale rapidly the infrastructure under an application, that sort of flexibility is a new use case for us and its expanding our footprint and touching new applications, specifically applications that are in test and development. We didn't have the opportunity before to intercept these applications at their inception, and now we can. And the third aspect of that is, we are also now for the first time giving application developers direct visibility into their virtual instance of F5. And they are seeing analytics and the performance of their applications, and so we're building a relationship with that developers that we didn't have before and that's driving new deployments into new applications. So I would characterize it right now as largely addressing the long tail of applications you heard us talk about inside of existing customers more than focusing on going and looking out for new customers. I do think though we will address new customer segments, as we introduce in the first half of '19 F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform."

One driver of this stability is security use cases driving spend in ADC for us, that's not all ADC vendors have access to it because they don't have the security capabilities, things like SSL Orchestration or web application firewall or Access Manager consolidated on ADC, that's driving stability for us in ADC. There are new use cases, such as steps in the federal sector or IoT that are driving demand for our hardware products.

I just want to follow up on the new customer question from earlier around Cloud Editions. I think, there was a broader view of a lot of traditional on-premise software companies that they won't be able to capture the cloud native application or the company that maybe just starts fresh in the cloud. And I think, there's been some talk of companies, like yourself that are building software in the cloud platform, sign the customer, then maybe there is even an opportunity on-prem down the road. So could you just double-click on that a little bit more? I know you briefly touched on it, but I'm just wondering, have you seen cases like that? Or is it just too soon to know?"

And as they grow and start to worry a bit more about their profit, they start worrying about how they control their cost. And we have seen some of them almost graduate from this born in the cloud environment and come back and ran colocation capabilities and actually come back to us for hardware ADCs. So we have seen those cases. I don't know this was a trend that's going to be much stronger in the future than it is today, but we are seeing that. But as it relates to acquiring customers directly in the cloud for companies that were historically on-prem like us, we think it's an opportunity that largely for us is untapped because you're right, we don't play in that market today. But that's why we are quite excited about F5 as a Service coming in the first half of '19 because that's going to allow us to really intercept these born in the cloud applications in a native cloud consumption experience for those who are building their app in the public cloud's platform environment. And so we're pretty excited about our opportunity to play there and intercept these applications. And then, down the road, as these applications grow, if they too have multi-cloud requirements, it will make it that much easier for us to contribute to their requirements beyond the single public cloud. And so F5 as a Service essentially will be our leading entry into the relationship, which we will expand from."

So in terms of disclosure of security revenues, we -- as you know, we don't break that out. I would say that the percentage of our ADC sales that are driven by security use cases or that include a component of security in the overall bundle has steadily increased. And today, it's a meaningful percentage of our ADC sales. We don't break it out. It's not just a question of on the size of the revenue, but it has to do with -- in a number of cases, it's very subjective to determine whether a sale was driven by security or ADC or both. And so that's the reason that we don't break it out today and there is not a clear trigger for when we will. In terms of your -- and I'll take the third part of your question then the second one.  Where we have been seeing very strong success to date, historically, and Tal, I would say that would be up until kind of the middle of 2018 was really in these consolidated use case, where we -- it's very convenient for a lot of our enterprise customers to consolidate onto an ADC application firewall, identity and access capability, some encryption, decryption capabilities. And so this use case of consolidation in the ADC and the enterprise has been extremely successful and will continued to be. That is also true in the service provider world where our capabilities around CGNAT, CCP optimization, carrier-grade firewalls, consolidated into an ADC capability is very appealing to service providers. So I would say, if you look historically, the consolidation of multiple security modules and functions that allows 1 to reduce CapEx and reduce complexity has played out in the enterprise and service providers. Going forward in 2019, we're very excited about 2 stand-alone security use cases. The first one is our advanced web application firewall, where we've already released that product and we're seeing great initial traction. We're really differentiated relative to other players because of our Layer 7 capabilities, but also bot litigation capabilities, and that differentiation today is on-prem, but we're going to bring our WAF capabilities into F5 as a Service and we think that's going to be a big differentiator for us. And then the second one we're very excited about is our SSL Orchestration capability. So mid mass use this case because all enterprise customers are dealing with -- the vast majority of their traffic is encrypted and we provide a very efficient solution to encrypt and decrypt the traffic through what we call break and inspect and then chain multiple security services together, which saves very significant dollars to an enterprise customers. So these 2 areas, Tal, we expect them to be 2 meaningful growth drivers for us in stand-alone security next year.

And if you look regionally, I think, you've now posted high single-digit growth in the EMEA region for the fifth straight quarter. The Americas were flat and they've been flat-to-low-single-digit in the region for the last several quarters. Asia-Pac was 11%, following 8% growth in the preceding quarter and Japan was 11% following 4% in Q3. Some of that may be easy comps in the latter 2. But my question to you is, if you look at the regions, what accounts for the differences? You would think from an economic perspective, with U.S. having perked up, and in EMEA much less so, it's sort of counterintuitive. But is this a reflection of ongoing service provider weakness?

So the -- there are 2 -- you are correct that both application developers and their close cousin, DevOps people are gaining mindshare and influence in large enterprise organizations. That's resulting into 2 things. First, for our traditional buyers, Network Infrastructure, that is typically in central IT, they want to offer a better SLA to app developers and DevOps people. And so part of our portfolio strategy, our multi-cloud strategy is to enable our current buyers to offer that better SLAs. Cloud Edition, just -- I just discussed earlier, does exactly that. It offers this per-app capability, which means an app developer doesn't have to wait for a maintenance window for 5 weeks so that all applications can align to an upgrade. They can do their thing on their part, on their infrastructure. We also get more analytics and got more visibility in their application. But that Cloud Edition is typically purchased by a network operation's person and they use that new technology to offer a different SLA to app developers. So that's kind of motion 1. The solutions we're releasing in 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native application platform, those will appeal directly to the DevOps buyer. And they will allow them to essentially procure their own technology on their terms. And so associated with that, we have a significant efforts around digital marketing, digital sales, and a tech touch for these buyers that essentially allow them to procure the -- to trial and explore trial and procure the technology in the way they want to do it, which is very different than our traditional buyers currently. So that's how we will address that community as well, but that journey starts in 2019."

Great, Simon. So let's start. So today, there are applications we don't support, that are typically applications that are born in the cloud either in test or development or even in production and that, I would say, have relatively simple load balancing requirements. Those applications are largely addressed by the native load balancers offered by the large public cloud providers. And now in -- so that's where they play. And today, we largely play in enterprises that have either on-prem requirements or multi-cloud deployment requirements. So if somebody wants to deploy an application or a portfolio of applications in multiple public clouds, typically, we're going to have a play there because we are cloud agnostic. And we will in that scenario partner with the public cloud providers to help the customers migrate their application to these environments. And when F5 is supporting an application on-prem and it migrates, in the vast, vast, vast majority of the cases, we will stay with that application and they will stay with us. Now in -- so that's kind of the lay of the land today. In 2019, as we introduce our new platforms in F5 as a Service, we will also play in born in the cloud applications. But the value add that we bring beyond the cloud native load balances is the future depth and breadth that a lot of these applications want, when they want global server load balancing, some security capability. And our partners in this case, the cloud providers are actually interested in partnering with us to enable these capabilities in their environment in a seamless way for these applications. And that's actually one of the reasons that I mentioned in the script earlier, that Barry and Venu have joined us from AWS. One of the reasons for that is they have deep insights, both into the economics of application, public to public cloud and the technology associated with the deployment and they're very interested in this multi-cloud strategy and how we're going to deploy our business in these environments."

Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we executed and overachieved our 2018 plan and continue to align to our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 goals, driving growth and strong operational results across the business during the fourth quarter. We are seeing significant traction for the long-term vision we outlined in our March 2018 Analyst and Investor Day, and furthering momentum in software and security sales. Customers continued to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments, as they deploy incremental workloads, dynamically both on premises and in cloud environments. 
Our product revenue growth continued in Q4 with products delivering 3% growth led by software. Public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area with an increasing demand for security solutions. We expect our cloud native offerings will allow us to extend our growth and expand our public cloud reach in 2019. 
In addition, we continued to see strong customer response to our recently launched ELA and Virtual Edition subscription consumption models. Good initial deal closure and strong pipeline growth indicates these new consumption models will be especially important with our new cloud offerings, including BIG-IP Cloud Edition. 
Systems continued to show resilience with growth opportunities in certain geographies, including China and Latin America, and with customers that want to control and manage the end-to-end application delivery solution and certain high-performance use cases.
Rounding out the business drivers, our Services business continues to perform well, delivering 6% growth in the quarter. We are seeing consistently strong attach rates on maintenance and driving continued year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We're particularly proud of our continued world-class customer satisfaction scores, reflecting our relentless commitment to our customers and their increasingly complex application deployments. I will speak more on some of the customer wins and use cases in the quarter later in our prepared remarks. But right now, I'll hand the call to Frank to review our Q4 and fiscal year 2018 results and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Frank?"

As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $5",1100,"Thank you, François. As François noted, we drove strong financial and operating results in Q4 and for the year. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guided range of $555 million to $565 million. GAAP EPS of $2.18 per share was well above our guidance of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 per share was also well above our guidance of $2.61 to $2.64 per share. The beats for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were driven largely by strength in revenue, expense discipline and lower-than-expected effective tax rates. 
Q4 product revenue of $256 million, was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. Software was approximately 17% of product revenue and grew more than 19% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 83% of product revenue and grew 18 basis points year-over-year. Services revenue of $306 million, grew 6% year-over-year, and represented approximately 54% of total revenue. 
On a regional basis in Q4, Americas grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 25% of overall revenue. APAC revenue grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 15% of total revenue, while Japan grew 15% year-over-year and accounted for 5% of total revenue. Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 16%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
In Q4, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue, Tech Data, which accounted for 11% and Westcon and Arrow, each at 10%. 
Let's now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strengths in services margin, as we continue to leverage automation to optimize our support organization. Last quarter, we took steps to further align investment with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we are accelerating investment in our road map and market development efforts in the fastest-growing opportunities of our business; cloud and security. As a result, we took $20.9 million in restructuring and facility exit charges during Q4, which are reflected in our GAAP results.
GAAP operating expenses of $316 million were below our $317 million to $329 million guided range, driven largely by operating efficiency and lower-than-expected restructuring expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were within our guided range at $263 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 27.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% lower than anticipated, due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.3%.
GAAP and non-GAAP effective rates also benefited from year-end adjustments related to our domestic tax filings as well as our mix of profits and lower tax rate jurisdictions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.45 billion at year-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 47 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.4 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 5.3% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. 
On employees, our restructuring initiative in Q4 impacted approximately 215 employees. Executing on our plan to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, during the quarter, we hired 150 employees and ended the quarter with approximately 4,410 employees, down approximately 65 people from Q3.  We continue to hire aggressively in our growth areas. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 864,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $173.69 per share for a total of $150 million. 
Quickly recapping our fiscal year results. For the full year, total revenue grew 3.4% to $2.16 billion. Product revenue of $960 million decreased 0.5% from the prior year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Within product revenue, software revenue grew 23%, while systems revenue declined 4% over the same period. Services revenue of $1.2 billion grew approximately 6.7% during the year and represented 56% of the total. GAAP net income for FY '18 was $454 million or $7.32 per share and non-GAAP net income was $612 million or $9.87 per share. In FY '18, cash flow from operations totaled $761 million and capital expenditures were $53 million.
Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q1 of FY '19. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Overall, we remain confident in our position in the market and in the growth opportunities for the business with solid software momentum. We believe the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environment is strong and will be a fundamental growth driver for the solutions we offer today and those we will launch in 2019. With this in mind, as well as factoring in our normal seasonality, for the first quarter of FY '19, we are targeting revenue in the range of $542 million to $552 million.
We expect gross margins at or around 85%. We estimate operating expenses of $265 million to $277 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be between 21% and 22% with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.51 to $2.54 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $39 million and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with broad modeling assumptions for FY '19 fiscal year. 
As we discussed in March at our investor conference, we are tracking to our Horizon 1 outlook with our FY '19 operating plan. For FY '19, from the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We anticipate gross margins at or around 85% for the year. We expect operating margin in the mid-30s range, in line with recent years results, moving down slightly in Q2 and Q3 from Q1 and then in Q4 in the upper 30s. 
Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in a range of $155 million to $165 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million in cost related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in downtown Seattle, as we ready the space for occupancy this year. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

I'll spend a few minutes highlighting some customer wins and use cases from the quarter. Then I'll conclude our prepared remarks with comments about drivers for fiscal 2019 and our evolution to a multi-cloud application services company. The first customer win I'll talk to spotlights F5 role in network function virtualization. During the quarter, a large Tier 1 service provider selected F5 in an initial 5G VNS deployment based on overall performance in our Virtual Edition platform's ability to consolidate various functions within the core. Importantly, the customer expects to use this as the baseline for the future virtualized core designs. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we continue to see good acceptance of our new ELA and subscription consumption models, which are another element of F5's multi-cloud value proposition, offering customers insurance against the uncertainties associated with cloud deployment, including providing timeline flexibility. 
As an example, we secured an ELA deal in Q4 with a North American healthcare infrastructure provider, who provides a Software-as-a-Service offering. An existing F5 customer, this customer required the same level of F5 application services they had on-prem as they moved to the public cloud.
The ELA structure was important because it provided the agility they needed, as they scaled their offerings over time. An added bonus, F5's ability to provide multiple services enabled the customer to consolidate several security elements on their existing infrastructure. 
Turning to our security offerings. Advanced Web Application Firewall or Advanced WAF continues on a solid growth trajectory. F5's Advanced WAF provides a powerful set of security features that keep web applications safe from attack. In 1 deployment during the quarter, we replaced the competitor in a Virtual Edition software environment, specifically because of our bot detection and litigation capabilities. We were also deployed by a managed care provider who is moving to the public cloud to reduce the time to turn up new customer applications. We worked with the customer to move critical applications from shared F5 appliances through dedicated high-performance Virtual Editions, extending the same on-prem policy to their cloud deployments and replacing the application security manager or ASM with Advanced WAF on the existing F5 appliances, while deploying Virtual Editions with Advanced WAF to support new applications in the public cloud. This customer will also deploy our BIG-IP Cloud Edition
to support new apps going into the public cloud.
And these are just a few examples of wins the sales team is driving. Let me close our remarks today with some thoughts about fiscal 2019. Last quarter, we spoke to our efforts to repurpose investment to focus on growth areas and ensure our product development and sales efforts were aligned with our most significant growth opportunities. As Frank noted, we're adding resources in priority areas and extending our software portfolio and stand-alone security products. As a result, we've got several new drivers to move toward in fiscal 2019. One of these drivers is our BIG-IP Cloud Edition, a bundle of our BIG-IP centralized managed solution and BIG-IP Virtual Edition sold on a per-app basis. Cloud Edition helps us address a large subset of applications by reducing the total cost of ownership of providing application services, while providing more application's management. We have strong conviction that Cloud Edition is addressing new use cases and will be instrumental in expanding our multi-cloud platform strategy. While not yet a material contributor to our revenue, the platform's ability to provide a single management console for both on-prem and cloud application services is resonating strongly with customers and the regional demand we saw for the product immediately following its release in April 2018, has now turned global.
We are seeing strong interest and demand across all our territories, and we expect sales activity to increase in fiscal 2019, as we build customer references. 
In our security portfolio, we've got a new stand-alone version of SSL Orchestrator scheduled for release in December. The amount of SSL traffic is growing rapidly, requiring customers to use significant resources to greater inspect for security purposes.  F5's SSL Orchestrator has gained strong traction as a solution on a range of F5 platforms and we expect its availability as a stand-alone product to enable increased penetration with security buyers. Designed to optimize customers' SSL infrastructure by providing security devices with highly efficient visibility of SSL-encrypted traffic, it also supports policy-based management and stealing of traffic through existing security devices through service training. This makes it easy to integrate into existing architectures, enabling customers to easily apply corporate security controls to all their encrypted traffic. We are already building a strong pipeline for the stand-alone SSL Orchestrator offering, particularly with enterprise and government customers, and the sales team is very excited about the opportunity to drive additional growth in new buying centers.
We are also making good progress with both our F5 as a Service and cloud native platforms. When we spoke about F5 as a Service at our Analyst and Investor event in March of 2018, we said, we expected to launch in 2019. At this point, I'm pleased to say we are on track for first commercial availability in the first half of calendar 2019, and are starting to build pilots for lighthouse customers. In concert, we are working internally to build the muscle that will enable us to target the expanded customers set we expect this product would appeal to. Our internal digital transformation efforts, include expanding our digital touch motion to ensure frictionless procurement and service renewals. 
At the March Investor event, we also highlighted the investment we're making to deliver Cloud-Native Applications Services in FY '19. This program is also on track for launch in the first half of calendar 2019. Our innovation teams have built out functionality that enables intelligent traffic management services and an API-first interaction model across select private and public clouds. I have seen the product demos, and I am looking forward to sharing more, as we progress with our efforts to unlock latent demand through lighter weight offerings optimized for CI/CD workflows. 
In addition to pushing forward with our multi-cloud focus solution set, we're also building our public cloud expertise. I am pleased to announce that Barry Russell has joined F5 from AWS to succeed Chad Whalen in leading our cloud sales team. Barry is a business development, sales and operational leader, who brings us 20-plus years of experience. Most recently, Barry was General Manager of Global Business Development and Field Operations for the AWS Marketplace and Service Catalog, where he built the AWS Marketplace ISV ecosystem, and digital software catalog. Barry's prior leadership roles include business development and service provider sales leadership at Microsoft as well as a role at Nivio and Level 3 Communications and we're very excited to have him on board to further F5's expansion into multi-cloud opportunities globally.
Barry joins another former AWS colleague, Venu Aravamudan, who joined F5 in fiscal 2018 to lead our F5 as a Service business. Venu is a seasoned software executive and expert in cloud computing with leadership experience spanning product development, product management, program management and product and solution marketing. His leading-edge experience with public cloud services and infrastructure platforms, services development, deployment and operation and enterprise IT transformation to cloud made him ideal to lead our F5 as a Service program. Prior to joining F5 in 2018, Venu was General Manager in the Amazon Relational Database Services business unit and previously held leadership roles at Limelight Networks, VMware and Microsoft. We're excited to have both Barry and Venu's cloud expertise at F5. 
In closing, I'd reiterate that we are making meaningful progress toward our long-term vision for F5 with continued momentum in software and security solutions. My thanks to the entire F5 team and our partners for the progress we've made. As a team, we're excited about the year ahead, and we look forward to reporting on our continued progress in fiscal 2019. 
With that, we will now open the call to Q&A."

So the first thing, Rod, on software, I'd tell you, no, you should not read anything into the 19%. I am very excited about where we're at on software generally and where we're going into 2019. The context for the Q4 19% is, first of all, software as a percentage of overall revenue is still relatively small. And so as I shared in last quarter, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but the general trends are going to be what we've said. We -- specifically for this quarter, we had it tough compared to Q4 of 2017, which was a big software quarter. I think that's part of what you're seeing in this growth rate that's a little less than last quarter. But if you look overall, in Q4, 17% was -- sorry, software was 17% of product revenue, so we're up from 15% in prior quarters. And as a percentage of the mix, we're on trajectory to achieve our Horizon 1 goals. I said, I'm very excited for where we're at on software and that's because of what I foresee is going to be happening in 2019. So at our analyst conference, we said, we would be, in Horizon 1, which was 2019 and 2020, we said we will see software growth that would be in the 30% to 35% range. And I feel confident we're going to be in that range. We've got a lot of things driving software growth in 2019. First of all, I'll point to just 3 of them. First of all, we're seeing really good momentum on our ELAs, these enterprise license agreements. They're driving a larger deal size and they're also allowing us to expand our use cases and start to take footprint for either -- from either cloud native or different open source of virtual ADC competitors with these new model of consumption. So that's going to drive growth in software. Our Cloud Edition is ramping very well from the first 4 months we've had in the market. So we expect a meaningful contribution of Cloud Edition in 2019. And as you probably heard from the script, we also have new products that are coming now in the first half of 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform. So we've got very good drivers in '19, and I expect, we're going to be in the range that we've discussed for Horizon 1. Frank, on the China?"

And then on the 606, we have a very, very small de minimis impact, frankly, from the change to 605 to 606 that we've discussed in our financial statements for the past couple of years. And so the guidance that we've given reflects the 606 impact, but it is very minimal. And we've seen the same attach rates and do not see any unusual discount in the maintenance."

What you're talking about is the sort of unit price of a Virtual Edition, a classic Virtual Edition of F5 versus the new Cloud Edition. But the new Cloud Edition on a per unit basis is a fraction of the price of the Virtual Edition, but remember that a Virtual Edition typically support anywhere between 5 and 10 applications, and a Cloud Edition is bought on a per application basis. And so what we're seeing in the initial deals that we've done on Cloud Edition is that the number of apps that are supported is significant. And so overall, there is no impact on the deal size. It's about the same deal size as what it's been on Virtual Editions. It's just a different consumption model that allows more flexibility for the user to manage their infrastructure on a per-app basis."

The -- we have a lot of customers that are buying traditional hardware motion and are adding to that Virtual Editions on -- Virtual Editions on-prem, that's kind of a classic deployment model. What we're seeing is more and more these customers also want to deploy their infrastructure in multiple public clouds. And their desire is to manage all these instances of ADCs as part of a single portfolio and ideally through a single pane of glass. Our ELAs enable them to do that and give them the flexibility to consume as many licenses as they want of software, and whether they put these licenses on-prem or in the public cloud. The initial -- I'm talking about software purely right now. The initial view we're seeing from the consumption of these ELAs is very strong, i.e. they signed up for a minimum amount of consumption and we're seeing in the early months of consumption that they're well on track to exceed that minimal amount of consumption, which bodes well for true-up in the future. What we've seen as it relates to hardware is that generally customers that use us in a multi-cloud deployment scenario overall spend more with us than customers that use us just in a traditional hardware deployment models. And so that's, I think, how I would frame it for you is the overall spend for a multi-cloud customer is larger than one that is not -- or the one that is to pure hardware."

So minimal contribution in '18, but we do expect -- given the traction that we've seen so far, we do expect meaningful contribution in fiscal '19. In terms of the gross margins, yes, the answer is no different than what we've sort of aimed that over time we do expect the software contribution grows to have some impact on our -- positive impact on our gross margins. If you recall, at the end of our Horizon 2, which is 2022, we expected our software to be about 40% of total product revenues. I think by then, we would see meaningful impact. That being said, our margins are roughly 85% right now. And so the room for expansion isn't significant.

So new customer and new logo acquisitions is going to continue. What we're seeing with Cloud Edition is, within our existing customers, we are unlocking new footprint that we didn't have before. There are a couple of use cases that we could not address before. One is, when customers want to really deploy on a per-app basis, we couldn't touch those types of deployments, we now can. And two, is the ability to scale rapidly the infrastructure under an application, that sort of flexibility is a new use case for us and its expanding our footprint and touching new applications, specifically applications that are in test and development. We didn't have the opportunity before to intercept these applications at their inception, and now we can. And the third aspect of that is, we are also now for the first time giving application developers direct visibility into their virtual instance of F5. And they are seeing analytics and the performance of their applications, and so we're building a relationship with that developers that we didn't have before and that's driving new deployments into new applications. So I would characterize it right now as largely addressing the long tail of applications you heard us talk about inside of existing customers more than focusing on going and looking out for new customers. I do think though we will address new customer segments, as we introduce in the first half of '19 F5 as a Service and our cloud native app services platform."

And we still expect quarterly fluctuations on the hardware number, but overall, we're executing as per the plan and I think we're getting share. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One driver of this stability is security use cases driving spend in ADC for us, that's not all ADC vendors have access to it because they don't have the security capabilities, things like SSL Orchestration or web application firewall or Access Manager consolidated on ADC, that's driving stability for us in ADC. There are new use cases, such as steps in the federal sector or IoT that are driving demand for our hardware products. There are geographies where there is significant demand for new hardware, specifically in the emerging markets, places like China and Latin America. And so all of these factors are driving stability in the hardware business along the lines of what we had said would happen at the Investor Meeting."

And as they grow and start to worry a bit more about their profit, they start worrying about how they control their cost. And we have seen some of them almost graduate from this born in the cloud environment and come back and ran colocation capabilities and actually come back to us for hardware ADCs. So we have seen those cases. I don't know this was a trend that's going to be much stronger in the future than it is today, but we are seeing that. But as it relates to acquiring customers directly in the cloud for companies that were historically on-prem like us, we think it's an opportunity that largely for us is untapped because you're right, we don't play in that market today. But that's why we are quite excited about F5 as a Service coming in the first half of '19 because that's going to allow us to really intercept these born in the cloud applications in a native cloud consumption experience for those who are building their app in the public cloud's platform environment. And so we're pretty excited about our opportunity to play there and intercept these applications. And then, down the road, as these applications grow, if they too have multi-cloud requirements, it will make it that much easier for us to contribute to their requirements beyond the single public cloud. And so F5 as a Service essentially will be our leading entry into the relationship, which we will expand from."

So in terms of disclosure of security revenues, we -- as you know, we don't break that out. I would say that the percentage of our ADC sales that are driven by security use cases or that include a component of security in the overall bundle has steadily increased. And today, it's a meaningful percentage of our ADC sales. We don't break it out. It's not just a question of on the size of the revenue, but it has to do with -- in a number of cases, it's very subjective to determine whether a sale was driven by security or ADC or both. And so that's the reason that we don't break it out today and there is not a clear trigger for when we will. In terms of your -- and I'll take the third part of your question then the second one.  Where we have been seeing very strong success to date, historically, and Tal, I would say that would be up until kind of the middle of 2018 was really in these consolidated use case, where we -- it's very convenient for a lot of our enterprise customers to consolidate onto an ADC application firewall, identity and access capability, some encryption, decryption capabilities. And so this use case of consolidation in the ADC and the enterprise has been extremely successful and will continued to be. That is also true in the service provider world where our capabilities around CGNAT, CCP optimization, carrier-grade firewalls, consolidated into an ADC capability is very appealing to service providers. So I would say, if you look historically, the consolidation of multiple security modules and functions that allows 1 to reduce CapEx and reduce complexity has played out in the enterprise and service providers. Going forward in 2019, we're very excited about 2 stand-alone security use cases. The first one is our advanced web application firewall, where we've already released that product and we're seeing great initial traction. We're really differentiated relative to other players because of our Layer 7 capabilities, but also bot litigation capabilities, and that differentiation today is on-prem, but we're going to bring our WAF capabilities into F5 as a Service and we think that's going to be a big differentiator for us. And then the second one we're very excited about is our SSL Orchestration capability. So mid mass use this case because all enterprise customers are dealing with -- the vast majority of their traffic is encrypted and we provide a very efficient solution to encrypt and decrypt the traffic through what we call break and inspect and then chain multiple security services together, which saves very significant dollars to an enterprise customers. So these 2 areas, Tal, we expect them to be 2 meaningful growth drivers for us in stand-alone security next year. And if you recall, that was one of our growth pillars from the conversation at [ AIM ] in March."

But they're addressing new use cases with the SecOps buyer. In terms of marketing and top leadership, most of our customers see today as a security company. We have a significant muscle in security, in threat research of an organization called F5 Labs that publishes research on security issues on a regular basis and that is very well read within our customer and partner community. So there are tons of things that we don't necessarily talk about, because they've been in the go-to-market motion of F5 now for already several years."

So François, first a clarification, I heard your response to the end demand question, with respect to, I think, I heard you say that U.S. service provider weakened in the last 3 to 4 weeks. My question on that is within enterprise, what are you seeing from an end demand perspective? And if you look regionally, I think, you've now posted high single-digit growth in the EMEA region for the fifth straight quarter. The Americas were flat and they've been flat-to-low-single-digit in the region for the last several quarters. Asia-Pac was 11%, following 8% growth in the preceding quarter and Japan was 11% following 4% in Q3. Some of that may be easy comps in the latter 2. But my question to you is, if you look at the regions, what accounts for the differences? You would think from an economic perspective, with U.S. having perked up, and in EMEA much less so, it's sort of counterintuitive. But is this a reflection of ongoing service provider weakness? What's going -- what is that regional information? What should it be telling us in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of your business? And then I have a follow-up question."

And over time, and it's still ongoing, but the locus of purchasing power seems to be shifting, seems to be in progress. To what extent do you all have an issue? And if you do, to what extent you're addressing it?

Do you already have the mindshare? Or do you need to do meaningful work in terms of gaining the mindshare among that community?"

So the -- there are 2 -- you are correct that both application developers and their close cousin, DevOps people are gaining mindshare and influence in large enterprise organizations. That's resulting into 2 things. First, for our traditional buyers, Network Infrastructure, that is typically in central IT, they want to offer a better SLA to app developers and DevOps people. And so part of our portfolio strategy, our multi-cloud strategy is to enable our current buyers to offer that better SLAs. Cloud Edition, just -- I just discussed earlier, does exactly that. It offers this per-app capability, which means an app developer doesn't have to wait for a maintenance window for 5 weeks so that all applications can align to an upgrade. They can do their thing on their part, on their infrastructure. We also get more analytics and got more visibility in their application. But that Cloud Edition is typically purchased by a network operation's person and they use that new technology to offer a different SLA to app developers. So that's kind of motion 1. The solutions we're releasing in 2019, both F5 as a Service and our cloud native application platform, those will appeal directly to the DevOps buyer. And they will allow them to essentially procure their own technology on their terms. And so associated with that, we have a significant efforts around digital marketing, digital sales, and a tech touch for these buyers that essentially allow them to procure the -- to trial and explore trial and procure the technology in the way they want to do it, which is very different than our traditional buyers currently. So that's how we will address that community as well, but that journey starts in 2019."

Great, Simon. So let's start. So today, there are applications we don't support, that are typically applications that are born in the cloud either in test or development or even in production and that, I would say, have relatively simple load balancing requirements. Those applications are largely addressed by the native load balancers offered by the large public cloud providers. And now in -- so that's where they play. And today, we largely play in enterprises that have either on-prem requirements or multi-cloud deployment requirements. So if somebody wants to deploy an application or a portfolio of applications in multiple public clouds, typically, we're going to have a play there because we are cloud agnostic. And we will in that scenario partner with the public cloud providers to help the customers migrate their application to these environments. And when F5 is supporting an application on-prem and it migrates, in the vast, vast, vast majority of the cases, we will stay with that application and they will stay with us. Now in -- so that's kind of the lay of the land today. In 2019, as we introduce our new platforms in F5 as a Service, we will also play in born in the cloud applications. But the value add that we bring beyond the cloud native load balances is the future depth and breadth that a lot of these applications want, when they want global server load balancing, some security capability. And our partners in this case, the cloud providers are actually interested in partnering with us to enable these capabilities in their environment in a seamless way for these applications. And that's actually one of the reasons that I mentioned in the script earlier, that Barry and Venu have joined us from AWS. One of the reasons for that is they have deep insights, both into the economics of application, public to public cloud and the technology associated with the deployment and they're very interested in this multi-cloud strategy and how we're going to deploy our business in these environments."
