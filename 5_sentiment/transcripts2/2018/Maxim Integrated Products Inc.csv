We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Given our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company's strategic position and increased access to our international cash provided by tax ref",1041,"Thanks, Kathy. We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Given our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company's strategic position and increased access to our international cash provided by tax reform, I'm pleased to announce that we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As a result, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.42 a share and increasing our stock repurchases going forward. 
Let me now discuss our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $623 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago, which reflects the 14-week quarter and includes $22 million from the transition of our last distributor to sell-in accounting. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 29% from Industrial, 26% Consumer, 20% Comm and Data Center, 21% Automotive and 4% Computing. It's worth highlighting that Industrial plus Automotive is half of total company revenue, up from 37% over 3 years ago when we began breaking out our Automotive revenue as a separate category.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 47% of Maxim's revenue in the December quarter, excluding the sell-in accounting transition at Avnet North America. Resales in Q2 were strongly up 26% from the same quarter last year. We ended Q2 with 57 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 11 days from Q1. The decrease in days was driven by strong resales and management of channel inventory.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 67.6%, approximately 70 basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by strong operational execution and benefiting from the transition to sell-in accounting at Avnet North America. Special items in Q2 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $201 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter due to an extra week in the quarter, the full quarter impact of our annual comp adjustments in September and higher profit sharing. Special items in Q2 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges.
Q2 operating income, excluding special items, was $220 million. Operating margin at 35.3% of revenue is approximately flat from the prior quarter and up 490 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy.
Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 14%. Concerning tax reform, the key benefit for Maxim is improved access to international cash, providing greater flexibility for our use of cash. Our Q2 GAAP tax provision included a $244 million charge comprised primarily of an estimated $427 million tax on the deemed repatriation of historical international profit, partially offset by adjustments to reserves. 
The repatriation tax is payable over 8 years, with the first annual payment estimated at $34 million due in September 2018. At this time, we continue to estimate our long-term GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, at 14%. We are continuing to review our long-term rate in light of the tax reform and we'll update as appropriate. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.65, up 41% from the same quarter a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $230 million or 37% of revenue. Q2 inventory days ended at 126, up 9 days from Q1. Inventory dollars were up 6% from the prior quarter as we prepare for a strong revenue ramp in Q3. 
Gross capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were higher in the quarter for tooling to add capacity at a remaining fab in Oregon and from new testers to support automotive growth. As a result of tax reform, U.S. capital expenditures after September 27 will be fully and immediately expensed for tax purposes.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $849 million or 36% of revenue and up 27% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $77 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.5 million shares. Dividends totaled $101 million in the quarter or $0.36 per share. As stated earlier, we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders with a 17% increase in our dividend to $0.42 per share and an increased rate of stock repurchase. The dividend yield after this 17% increase in the dividend is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $49 million in the second quarter to $2.82 billion.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q3 backlog was $446 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $620 million to $660 million. Q3 revenue is expected to be above seasonal and up compared to the same quarter last year, driven by growth across all of our major markets. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin.
Special items in Q3 gross margin are estimated at approximately $11 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low to mid-$190s million, down from Q2, given a regular 13-week quarter and reflecting profit sharing. We are continuing to tightly manage costs consistent with our updated business model.
Special items in Q3 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q3, excluding special items, is expected to be 14%, flat from Q2. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.66 to $0.72.
In summary, we expect continued growth in Q3 revenue compared to the same quarter last year. We are growing content in Automotive, Industrial, Consumer and Data Center, which is helping to drive growth. And we are executing to the updated financial model disclosed a few months ago, resulting in strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tunç."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year,",1182,"All right. Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth was led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Automotive with continued solid company profitability. Looking forward, we expect strong growth in our March quarter, with significant growth in Automotive, Industrial and Consumer compared to the same quarter last year. Our profitability and revenue growth is enabling exceptionally strong earnings power and cash flow, giving us confidence to increase our return of capital to shareholders.
I would like to remind investors that our December quarter revenue included the benefit of the transition to Avnet North America sell-in accounting. December was also a 14-week quarter. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude these factors.
First, I will comment on Automotive. As we highlighted at the Consumer Electronics Show, our relationship with NVIDIA is alive and well. Maxim's leading-edge power management and serial link solutions continue to be part of NVIDIA's next-generation autonomous driving platforms. 
In addition to our strong NVIDIA partnership, we've continued to sell automotive power and interface products attached to multiple partner platforms at many automotive customers. In the December quarter, automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the March quarter, we forecast continued sequential growth from an above-seasonal December quarter, primarily driven by continued strength in our battery management system business.
Long term, we expect low teens growth for our Automotive business, driven in part by strong market acceptance of our battery management products for electric vehicles. Maxim has design wins at 28 different OEMs, which are producing over 70 different car models, some of which are yet to be released. We won these designs in many different regions of the world. Today, Maxim's revenue from EV opportunities is still relatively modest at roughly 1/10 of our total Automotive revenue. However, as of EV car sales increase, government initiatives and greater affordability for consumers, we expect DMS to be a strong growth driver for Maxim.
We're in the early days in the electronification of cars, and more cars are becoming equipped with driver assist or ADAS features. ADAS electronic controlled units are expected to double in 5 years according to third-party research. Car is increasingly becoming a data center on wheels, with high-end processors, multiple displays, sensors and cameras all requiring efficient power management and point-to-point high-speed data transmission. 
Collision warning and lane departure systems that were once only available in high-end cars will soon be options for standard equipment in midrange cars and trucks. Maxim has a complete portfolio of GMS serial link interfaces and power management ICs that connect and provide power to these safety systems. We have over $100 of potential infotainment and ADAS content opportunity in a premium car today. We expect this to double to $200 of opportunity for a premium car within the next 5 years.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. Our December quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up compared to the same quarter last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our safety -- and our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
In the quarter, we introduced new factory automation products that provide robust communication links and interfaces needed for the factory floor. Our new family of Controlled Area Network or CAN interface products provide superior electrostatic discharge protection and are designed to be used in harsh industrial environments that require high voltage fault protection. 
In addition, we introduced a new family of RS45 interface products that double data transmission speeds. These products can also drive longer cable links that are suitable for motion control systems in a factory setting. These new products augment our existing leading portfolio in I/O and communication and industrial power applications. Our factory automation family of products are being widely deployed, especially in Europe and Japan.
In our broad market business, we entered into 2 new distribution agreements in Japan. We expect these new distribution partners to enable us to extend our reach in the region, augmenting our online presence and deepening our focus on the industrial end market. We continue to improve our online support and website storefront, and we're increasing the use of analytics to identify, track and maximize the value of opportunities within the broad market.
In the December quarter, our total distribution channel sales was 47% of Maxim revenue, excluding revenue from the transition of Avnet North America to sell-in accounting. Our expanded distribution channel partnerships are bearing fruit by bringing Maxim's products to more small and medium business customers. Through this strategy, SMB customer revenue grew 24% compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the December quarter, Automotive and Industrial markets together contributed half of total company revenue.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the December quarter, while Comms and Data Center was flat from the same quarter last year. Growth in 100G optical products and 12-volt server power from the data center was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. We expect comms infrastructure to be sequentially up in the March quarter but down from the same quarter a year ago. We anticipate continued data center revenue growth in the March quarter, up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year. This strong growth is driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack to rack connectivity.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, our Consumer business was down from the same quarter a year ago due to smartphones, partially offset by growth in our broad-based Consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming products. In the March quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and from the same quarter last year, driven by above-average peak shipments for smartphones.
In Consumer, we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden our business into a proliferation of smart devices with strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals.
Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably and to improve our financial stability. We are demonstrating top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center and our Consumer business is stabilizing. Our broad market strategy is demonstrating revenue growth and enhanced profitability through our distribution partnership initiatives and improved reach to small and medium business customers. And we are focused on expanding our customer base so that we can sustain growth over the long term. And finally, we remain committed to maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by today's announcement that we will increase our return of capital to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathy."

And the normal step-up for you guys in the March quarter is about 4% to 6% sequentially. So can you just help us understand a couple of things here? What is driving the sharp acceleration here relative to normal seasonality? It looks like it's Industrial and Consumer but just at accelerated levels. Is it just more companies ramping factory automation products? Is it an acceleration of the broad market initiatives? And more importantly, is this revenue run rate sustainable, especially in the seasonally stronger first part of this year?"

As you said, Industrial is strongly up, contributed by the factory automation and again, the overall broad-based business. Our verticals, which are a smaller part of our industrial, are also showing some good growth in the quarter. And of course, Auto is seasonally up after a very strong December quarter.

I think from our point of view, the biggest benefit of tax reform is access to our global cash, greater flexibility. As I indicated from a P&L point of view, the -- our tax rate at this point is -- appears to be relatively unchanged. Obviously, we're still studying that, but for now it looks like it's still going to be around that 14%. But with that -- with tax reform and greater access to that -- to our offshore capital, that does kind of remove one of the risk factors that we always looked at when we thought about the 80% return of capital. And because at the time, right about 35%, 40% of our free cash flow was generated offshore. Now that we have access to all of our cash, we've always been very comfortable with the sustainability of our free cash flow model and feel very comfortable returning that to shareholders 100%. And so that's something we wanted to do, and we now have the opportunity to do that and I think it just highlights the strength of our model, which is kind of the growing the top line, improving profitability, low CapEx intensity and the ability, in a very sustainable way, to return that the shareholder. So that's why we went from the 80% to 100%. When we think about the dividend, probably 2 things to think about there. First off, we normally look at this once a year. Usually, it's in the summertime and we usually announce something in July during our Q4 earnings release. Since that time, our business has continued to do very well. And we do have kind of continued confidence in our growth and profitability initiatives. And so that certainly helped us from the confidence in increasing the dividend. The other thing we did do though is in thinking about that increase from 80% to 100% and how we allocate that between dividend and buyback, we always want to make sure when we think about our dividend that we don't get too far out in front and there's still some -- it's still early days on tax reform. So we took about 1/3 of that increase and allocated it to the dividend and about 2/3 that gets allocated to the buyback. I think we felt, as a management team, as a board, comfortable with that. We'll continue to our normal cadence of looking at our capital return in the summer as we have in the past. But I think today, with access to our global capital and the continued strength in the business, we felt comfortable both 80% -- going from 80% to 100% and increasing the dividend by $0.06 or 17%."

We also look at inventory in the channel, which obviously we control to some extent. But our lead times are within normal range and we're not experiencing any supply constraints.

We do still -- we look at our kind of our broad-based business and that's doing well. actually usually a little bit weaker in the first half of the year. And if we look across the other businesses, Industrial is usually kind of seasonally flat. Automotive, we expect to be up. And the Comm and Data Center, it's tough to predict but the comm infrastructure market has been weak. So those are sort of the kind of the typical levers that we have looked at for the June quarter. But for Consumer, we do expect it to be down."

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Given our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company's strategic position and increased access to our international cash provided by tax reform, I'm pleased to announce that we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As a result, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.42 a share and increasing our stock repurchases going forward. 
Let me now discuss our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $623 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago, which reflects the 14-week quarter and includes $22 million from the transition of our last distributor to sell-in accounting. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 29% from Industrial; 26%, Consumer; 20%, Comm and Data Center; 21%, Automotive; and 4%, Computing. It's worth highlighting that Industrial plus Automotive is half of total company revenue, up from 37% over 3 years ago when we began breaking out our Automotive revenue as a separate category.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 47% of Maxim's revenue in the December quarter, excluding the sell-in accounting transition at Avnet North America. Resales in Q2 were strongly up 26% from the same quarter last year. We ended Q2 with 57 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 11 days from Q1. The decrease in days was driven by strong resales and management of channel inventory.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 67.6%, approximately 70 basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by strong operational execution and benefiting from the transition to sell-in accounting at Avnet North America. Special items in Q2 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions.
Operating expenses excluding special items were $201 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter due to an extra week in the quarter, the full quarter impact of our annual comp adjustments in September and higher profit sharing. Special items in Q2 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges.
Q2 operating income excluding special items was $220 million. Operating margin at 35.3% of revenue is approximately flat from the prior quarter and up 490 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy.
Q2 GAAP tax rate excluding special items was 14%. Concerning tax reform, the key benefit for Maxim is improved access to international cash, providing greater flexibility for our use of cash. Our Q2 GAAP tax provision included a $244 million charge comprised primarily of an estimated $427 million tax on the deemed repatriation of historical international profits, partially offset by adjustments to reserves. 
The repatriation tax is payable over 8 years, with the first annual payment estimated at $34 million due in September 2018. At this time, we continue to estimate our long-term GAAP tax rate excluding special items at 14%. We are continuing to review our long-term tax -- long-term rate in light of the tax reform and we'll update as appropriate. 
GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.65, up 41% from the same quarter a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $230 million or 37% of revenue. Q2 inventory days ended at 126, up 9 days from Q1. Inventory dollars were up 6% from the prior quarter as we prepare for a strong revenue ramp in Q3. 
Gross capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were higher in the quarter for tooling to add capacity at a remaining fab in Oregon and from new testers to support automotive growth. As a result of tax reform, U.S. capital expenditures after September 27 will be fully and immediately expensed for tax purposes.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $849 million or 36% of revenue and up 27% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $77 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.5 million shares. Dividends totaled $101 million in the quarter or $0.36 per share. As stated earlier, we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders with a 17% increase in our dividend to $0.42 per share and an increased rate of stock repurchase. The dividend yield after this 17% increase in the dividend is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $49 million in the second quarter to $2.82 billion.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q3 backlog was $446 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $620 million to $660 million. Q3 revenue is expected to be above seasonal and up compared to the same quarter last year, driven by growth across all of our major markets. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin.
Special items in Q3 gross margin are estimated at approximately $11 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q3 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the low to mid-$190s million, down from Q2, given a regular 13-week quarter and reflecting profit sharing. We are continuing to tightly manage costs consistent with our updated business model.
Special items in Q3 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q3 excluding special items is expected to be 14%, flat from Q2. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.66 to $0.72.
In summary, we expect continued growth in Q3 revenue compared to the same quarter last year. We are growing content in Automotive, Industrial, Consumer and Data Center, which is helping to drive growth. And we are executing to the updated financial model disclosed a few months ago, resulting in strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tunç."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year,",1179,"All right. Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth was led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Automotive with continued solid company profitability. Looking forward, we expect strong growth in our March quarter, with significant growth in Automotive, Industrial and Consumer compared to the same quarter last year. Our profitability and revenue growth is enabling exceptionally strong earnings power and cash flow, giving us confidence to increase our return of capital to shareholders.
I would like to remind investors that our December quarter revenue included the benefit of the transition to Avnet North America sell-in accounting. December was also a 14-week quarter. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude these factors.
First, I will comment on Automotive. As we highlighted at the Consumer Electronics Show, our relationship with NVIDIA is alive and well. Maxim's leading-edge power management and serial link solutions continued to be part of NVIDIA's next-generation autonomous driving platforms. 
In addition to our strong NVIDIA partnership, we've continued to sell automotive power and interface products attached to multiple partner platforms at many automotive customers. In the December quarter, automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the March quarter, we forecast continued sequential growth from an above-seasonal December quarter, primarily driven by continued strength in our battery management system business.
Long term, we expect low teens growth for Automotive business, driven in part by strong market acceptance of our battery management products for electric vehicles. Maxim has design wins at 28 different OEMs, which are producing over 70 different car models, some of which are yet to be released. We won these designs in many different regions of the world. Today, Maxim's revenue from EV opportunities is still relatively modest at roughly 1/10 of our total Automotive revenue. However, as the EV car sales increased government initiatives and greater affordability for consumers, we expect BMS to be a strong growth driver for Maxim.
We're in the early days in the electronification of cars, and more cars are becoming equipped with driver assist or ADAS features. ADAS electronic controlled units are expected to double in 5 years according to third-party research. Car is increasingly becoming a data center on wheels with high-end processors, multiple displays, sensors and cameras, all requiring efficient power management and point-to-point high-speed data transmission. 
Collision warning and lane departure systems that were once only available in high-end cars will soon be options or standard equipment in midrange cars and trucks. Maxim has a complete portfolio of GMSL serial link interfaces and power management ICs that connect and provide power to these safety systems. We have over $100 of potential infotainment and ADAS content opportunity in a premium car today. We expect this to double to $200 of opportunity for a premium car within the next 5 years.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. Our December quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up compared to the same quarter last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our safety -- and our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
In the quarter, we introduced new factory automation products that provide robust communication links and interfaces needed for the factory floor. Our new family of Controlled Area Network, or CAN, interface products provide superior electrostatic discharge protection and are designed to be used in harsh industrial environments that require a high-voltage fault protection. 
In addition, we introduced a new family of RS45 interface products that double data transmission speeds. These products can also drive longer cable links that are suitable for motion control systems in a factory setting. These new products augment our existing leading portfolio in I/O and communication and industrial power applications. Our factory automation family of products are being widely deployed, especially in Europe and Japan.
In our broad market business, we entered into 2 new distribution agreements in Japan. We expect these new distribution partners to enable us to extend our reach in the region, augmenting our online presence and deepening our focus on the industrial end market. We continue to improve our online support and website storefront and we're increasing the use of analytics to identify, track and maximize the value of opportunities within the broad market.
In the December quarter, our total distribution channel sales was 47% of Maxim revenue, excluding revenue from the transition of Avnet North America to sell-in accounting. Our expanded distribution channel partnerships are bearing fruit by bringing Maxim's products to more small and medium business customers. Through this strategy, SMB customer revenue grew 24% compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the December quarter, automotive and industrial markets together contributed half of total company revenue.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the December quarter, Comms and Data Center was flat from the same quarter last year. Growth in 100G optical products and 12-volt server power from the data center was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. We expect comms infrastructure to be sequentially up in the March quarter but down from the same quarter a year ago. We anticipate continued data center revenue growth in the March quarter, up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year. This strong growth is driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, our Consumer business was down from the same quarter a year ago due to smartphones, partially offset by growth in our broad-based Consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming products. In the March quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and from the same quarter last year, driven by above-average peak shipments for smartphones.
In Consumer, we continued to focus on our strategy to broaden our business into a proliferation of smart devices with a strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals.
Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably and to improve our financial stability. We are demonstrating top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center and our Consumer business is stabilizing. Our broad market strategy is demonstrating revenue growth and enhanced profitability through our distribution partnership initiatives and improved reach to small and medium business customers. And we are focused on expanding our customer base so that we can sustain growth over the long term. And finally, we remain committed to maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by today's announcement that we will increase our return of capital to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathy."

If I normalize the December quarter to 13 weeks and exclude the sell-in accounting benefits, your March quarter guide implies 10%, 11% sequential revenue growth and 10% year-over-year growth. And the normal step-up for you guys in the March quarter is about 4% to 6% sequentially. So can you just help us understand a couple of things here? What is driving the sharp acceleration here relative to normal seasonality? It looks like it's Industrial and Consumer but just at accelerated levels. Is it just more companies ramping factory automation products? Is it an acceleration of the broad market initiatives? And more importantly, is this revenue run rate sustainable, especially in the seasonally stronger first part of this year?"

As you said, Industrial is strongly up, contributed by the factory automation, and again, the overall broad-based business. Our verticals, which are a smaller part of our Industrial, are also showing some good growth in the quarter. And of course, Auto is seasonally up after a very strong December quarter. So overall, we're seeing good growth in -- I mean, even in Comm and Data Center, we're guiding that up on the strength of the Data Center side of the business as where actually I think the infrastructure side has been a little weaker.

I think from our point of view, the biggest benefit of tax reform is access to our global cash, greater flexibility. As I indicated from a P&L point of view, the -- our tax rate at this point is -- appears to be relatively unchanged. Obviously, we're still studying that, but for now it looks like it's still going to be around that 14%. But with that -- with tax reform and greater access to that -- to our offshore capital, that does kind of remove one of the risk factors that we always looked at when we thought about the 80% return of capital. And because at the time, right about 35%, 40% of our free cash flow was generated offshore. Now that we have access to all of our cash, we've always been very comfortable with the sustainability of our free cash flow model and feel very comfortable returning that to shareholders 100%. And so that's something we wanted to do, and we now have the opportunity to do that and I think it just highlights the strength of our model, which is kind of growing the top line, improving profitability, low CapEx intensity and the ability, in a very sustainable way, to return that the shareholder. So that's why we went from the 80% to 100%. When we think about the dividend, probably 2 things to think about there. First off, we normally look at this once a year. Usually, it's in the summertime and we usually announce something in July during our Q4 earnings release. Since that time, our business has continued to do very well. And we do have kind of continued confidence in our growth and profitability initiatives. And so that certainly helped us from the confidence in increasing the dividend. The other thing we did do, though, is in thinking about that increase from 80% to 100% and how we allocate that between dividend and buyback, we always want to make sure when we think about our dividend that we don't get too far out in front and there's still some -- it's still early days on tax reform. So we took about 1/3 of that increase and allocated it to the dividend and about 2/3 that gets allocated to the buyback. I think we felt, as a management team, as a board, comfortable with that. We'll continue to our normal cadence of looking at our capital return in the summer as we have in the past. But I think today, with access to our global capital and the continued strength in the business, we felt comfortable both 80% -- going from 80% to 100% and increasing the dividend by $0.06 or 17%."

We said that would be, again, over several years. We didn't give an exact time because it was somewhat dependent on top line growth. But we're -- we continue to be very focused on free cash flow. I think achieving the $3 just kind of, from our point of view, it was just a marker that we continue to deliver on our commitments. That's very important to us at Maxim.

And our guidance in Q3 is in line with that assessment. Internally, what we look at is what kind of lead times are customers giving us when they ask for products. And that gives you an indication of whether they are concerned about constraints or they're trying to take too much inventory and we look at that. We also look at inventory in the channel, which obviously we control to some extent. But our lead times are within normal range and we're not experiencing any supply constraints. And our lead times have been pretty much stable the entire year. Maybe they went up by little less than 1 week over that time. So those are the things that we look at.

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Given our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company's strategic position and increased access to our international cash provided by tax reform, I'm pleased to announce that we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As a result, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.42 a share and increasing our stock repurchases going forward. 
Let me now discuss our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $623 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago, which reflects the 14-week quarter and includes $22 million from the transition of our last distributor to sell-in accounting. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 29% from Industrial; 26%, Consumer; 20%, Comm and Data Center; 21%, Automotive; and 4%, Computing. It's worth highlighting that Industrial plus Automotive is half of total company revenue, up from 37% over 3 years ago when we began breaking out our Automotive revenue as a separate category.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 47% of Maxim's revenue in the December quarter, excluding the sell-in accounting transition at Avnet North America. Resales in Q2 were strongly up 26% from the same quarter last year. We ended Q2 with 57 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 11 days from Q1. The decrease in days was driven by strong resales and management of channel inventory.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 67.6%, approximately 70 basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by strong operational execution and benefiting from the transition to sell-in accounting at Avnet North America. Special items in Q2 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions.
Operating expenses excluding special items were $201 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter due to an extra week in the quarter, the full quarter impact of our annual comp adjustments in September and higher profit sharing. Special items in Q2 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges.
Q2 operating income excluding special items was $220 million. Operating margin at 35.3% of revenue is approximately flat from the prior quarter and up 490 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy.
Q2 GAAP tax rate excluding special items was 14%. Concerning tax reform, the key benefit for Maxim is improved access to international cash, providing greater flexibility for our use of cash. Our Q2 GAAP tax provision included a $244 million charge comprised primarily of an estimated $427 million tax on the deemed repatriation of historical international profits, partially offset by adjustments to reserves. 
The repatriation tax is payable over 8 years, with the first annual payment estimated at $34 million due in September 2018. At this time, we continue to estimate our long-term GAAP tax rate excluding special items at 14%. We are continuing to review our long-term tax -- long-term rate in light of the tax reform and we'll update as appropriate. 
GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.65, up 41% from the same quarter a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $230 million or 37% of revenue. Q2 inventory days ended at 126, up 9 days from Q1. Inventory dollars were up 6% from the prior quarter as we prepare for a strong revenue ramp in Q3. 
Gross capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were higher in the quarter for tooling to add capacity at a remaining fab in Oregon and for new testers to support automotive growth. As a result of tax reform, U.S. capital expenditures after September 27 will be fully and immediately expensed for tax purposes.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $849 million or 36% of revenue and up 27% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $77 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.5 million shares. Dividends totaled $101 million in the quarter or $0.36 per share. As stated earlier, we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders with a 17% increase in our dividend to $0.42 per share and an increased rate of stock repurchase. The dividend yield after this 17% increase in the dividend is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $49 million in the second quarter to $2.82 billion.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q3 backlog was $446 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $620 million to $660 million. Q3 revenue is expected to be above seasonal and up compared to the same quarter last year, driven by growth across all of our major markets. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin.
Special items in Q3 gross margin are estimated at approximately $11 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q3 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the low to mid-$190s million, down from Q2, given a regular 13-week quarter and reflecting profit sharing. We are continuing to tightly manage costs consistent with our updated business model.
Special items in Q3 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q3 excluding special items is expected to be 14%, flat from Q2. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.66 to $0.72.
In summary, we expect continued growth in Q3 revenue compared to the same quarter last year. We are growing content in Automotive, Industrial, Consumer and Data Center, which is helping to drive growth. And we are executing to the updated financial model disclosed a few months ago, resulting in strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tunç."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year,",1181,"All right. Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth was led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Automotive with continued solid company profitability. Looking forward, we expect strong growth in our March quarter, with significant growth in Automotive, Industrial and Consumer compared to the same quarter last year. Our profitability and revenue growth is enabling exceptionally strong earnings power and cash flow, giving us confidence to increase our return of capital to shareholders.
I would like to remind investors that our December quarter revenue included the benefit of the transition to Avnet North America sell-in accounting. December was also a 14-week quarter. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude these factors.
First, I will comment on Automotive. As we highlighted at the Consumer Electronics Show, our relationship with NVIDIA is alive and well. Maxim's leading-edge power management and serial link solutions continued to be part of NVIDIA's next-generation autonomous driving platforms. 
In addition to our strong NVIDIA partnership, we've continued to sell automotive power and interface products attached to multiple partner platforms at many automotive customers. In the December quarter, automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the March quarter, we forecast continued sequential growth from an above-seasonal December quarter, primarily driven by continued strength in our battery management system business.
Long term, we expect low teens growth for Automotive business, driven in part by strong market acceptance of our battery management products for electric vehicles. Maxim has design wins at 28 different OEMs, which are producing over 70 different car models, some of which are yet to be released. We won these designs in many different regions of the world. Today, Maxim's revenue from EV opportunities is still relatively modest at roughly 1/10 of our total Automotive revenue. However, as the EV car sales increased due to government initiatives and greater affordability for consumers we expect BMS to be a strong growth driver for Maxim.
We're in the early days in the electronification of cars, and more cars are becoming equipped with driver assist or ADAS features. ADAS electronic controlled units are expected to double in 5 years according to third-party research. Car is increasingly becoming a data center on wheels with high-end processors, multiple displays, sensors and cameras, all requiring efficient power management and point-to-point high-speed data transmission. 
Collision warning and lane departure systems that were once only available in high-end cars will soon be options or standard equipment in midrange cars and trucks. Maxim has a complete portfolio of GMSL serial link interfaces and power management ICs that connect and provide power to these safety systems. We have over $100 of potential infotainment and ADAS content opportunity in a premium car today. We expect this to double to $200 of opportunity for a premium car within the next 5 years.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. Our December quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up compared to the same quarter last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our safety -- and our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
In the quarter, we introduced new factory automation products that provide robust communication links and interfaces needed for the factory floor. Our new family of Controlled Area Network, or CAN, interface products provide superior electrostatic discharge protection and are designed to be used in harsh industrial environments that require a high-voltage fault protection. 
In addition, we introduced a new family of RS45 interface products that double data transmission speeds. These products can also drive longer cable links that are suitable for motion control systems in a factory setting. These new products augment our existing leading portfolio in I/O and communication and industrial power applications. Our factory automation family of products are being widely deployed, especially in Europe and Japan.
In our broad market business, we entered into 2 new distribution agreements in Japan. We expect these new distribution partners to enable us to extend our reach in the region, augmenting our online presence and deepening our focus on the industrial end market. We continue to improve our online support and website storefront and we're increasing the use of analytics to identify, track and maximize the value of opportunities within the broad market.
In the December quarter, our total distribution channel sales was 47% of Maxim revenue, excluding revenue from the transition of Avnet North America to sell-in accounting. Our expanded distribution channel partnerships are bearing fruit by bringing Maxim's products to more small and medium business customers. Through this strategy, SMB customer revenue grew 24% compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the December quarter, automotive and industrial markets together contributed half of total company revenue.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the December quarter, Comms and Data Center was flat from the same quarter last year. Growth in 100G optical products and 12-volt server power from the data center was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. We expect comms infrastructure to be sequentially up in the March quarter but down from the same quarter a year ago. We anticipate continued data center revenue growth in the March quarter, up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year. This strong growth is driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, our Consumer business was down from the same quarter a year ago due to smartphones, partially offset by growth in our broad-based Consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming products. In the March quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and from the same quarter last year, driven by above-average peak shipments for smartphones.
In Consumer, we continued to focus on our strategy to broaden our business into a proliferation of smart devices with a strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals.
Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably and to improve our financial stability. We are demonstrating top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center and our Consumer business is stabilizing. Our broad market strategy is demonstrating revenue growth and enhanced profitability through our distribution partnership initiatives and improved reach to small and medium business customers. And we are focused on expanding our customer base so that we can sustain growth over the long term. And finally, we remain committed to maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by today's announcement that we will increase our return of capital to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathy."

And the normal step-up for you guys in the March quarter is about 4% to 6% sequentially. So can you just help us understand a couple of things here? What is driving the sharp acceleration here relative to normal seasonality? It looks like it's Industrial and Consumer but just at accelerated levels.

Our verticals, which are a smaller part of our Industrial, are also showing some good growth in the quarter. And of course, Auto is seasonally up after a very strong December quarter. So overall, we're seeing good growth in -- I mean, even in Comm and Data Center, we're guiding that up on the strength of the Data Center side of the business as where actually I think the infrastructure side has been a little weaker.

I think from our point of view, the biggest benefit of tax reform is access to our global cash, greater flexibility. As I indicated from a P&L point of view, the -- our tax rate at this point is -- appears to be relatively unchanged. Obviously, we're still studying that, but for now it looks like it's still going to be around that 14%. But with that -- with tax reform and greater access to that -- to our offshore capital, that does kind of remove one of the risk factors that we always looked at when we thought about the 80% return of capital. And because at the time, right about 35%, 40% of our free cash flow was generated offshore. Now that we have access to all of our cash, we've always been very comfortable with the sustainability of our free cash flow model and feel very comfortable returning that to shareholders 100%. And so that's something we wanted to do, and we now have the opportunity to do that and I think it just highlights the strength of our model, which is kind of growing the top line, improving profitability, low CapEx intensity and the ability, in a very sustainable way, to return that to shareholders. So that's why we went from the 80% to 100%. When we think about the dividend, probably 2 things to think about there. First off, we normally look at this once a year. Usually, it's in the summertime and we usually announce something in July during our Q4 earnings release. Since that time, our business has continued to do very well. And we do have kind of continued confidence in our growth and profitability initiatives. And so that certainly helped us from the confidence in increasing the dividend. The other thing we did do, though, is in thinking about that increase from 80% to 100% and how we allocate that between dividend and buyback, we always want to make sure when we think about our dividend that we don't get too far out in front and there's still some -- it's still early days on tax reform. So we took about 1/3 of that increase and allocated it to the dividend and about 2/3 that gets allocated to the buyback. I think we felt, as a management team, as a board, comfortable with that. We'll continue to our normal cadence of looking at our capital return in the summer as we have in the past. But I think today, with access to our global capital and the continued strength in the business, we felt comfortable both 80% -- going from 80% to 100% and increasing the dividend by $0.06 or 17%."

That was the final goal from a couple of years ago that we achieved that. Obviously, we're well on our way and we'll easily surpass that in the next quarter. The goal we've set for ourselves is now $3.50. We've set that when we kind of upped the profitability targets, like gross margin to 67% to 70% and the operating margin to 37% to 40% and then we've set the $3.50. We said that would be, again, over several years. We didn't give an exact time because it was somewhat dependent on top line growth. But we're -- we continue to be very focused on free cash flow. I think achieving the $3 just kind of, from our point of view, it was just a marker that we continue to deliver on our commitments. That's very important to us at Maxim. And achieving that $3.50 is clearly the next target from a free cash flow for us to achieve."

So what we look at are several things. On the demand side, external signal side, we follow macroeconomic indicators, and those are basically what's the forecast for GDP growth and what's the manufacturing PMI trends going forward. So when we look at those, it looks like the business conditions are good, and pretty much the PMI -- manufacturing PMI is above 50% in almost all regions, so that's a good sign. And our guidance in Q3 is in line with that assessment. Internally, what we look at is what kind of lead times are customers giving us when they ask for products. And that gives you an indication of whether they are concerned about constraints or they're trying to take too much inventory and we look at that. We also look at inventory in the channel, which obviously we control to some extent. But our lead times are within normal range and we're not experiencing any supply constraints. And our lead times have been pretty much stable the entire year. Maybe they went up by little less than 1 week over that time. So those are the things that we look at. I mean, how are customers behaving, ordering patterns and what are the metric signals we're seeing."

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Given our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company's strategic position and increased access to our international cash provided by tax reform, I'm pleased to announce that we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As a result, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.42 a share and increasing our stock repurchases going forward. 
Let me now discuss our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $623 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago, which reflects the 14-week quarter and includes $22 million from the transition of our last distributor to sell-in accounting. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 29% from Industrial; 26%, Consumer; 20%, Comm and Data Center; 21%, Automotive; and 4%, Computing. It's worth highlighting that Industrial plus Automotive is half of total company revenue, up from 37% over 3 years ago when we began breaking out our Automotive revenue as a separate category.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 47% of Maxim's revenue in the December quarter, excluding the sell-in accounting transition at Avnet North America. Resales in Q2 were strongly up 26% from the same quarter last year. We ended Q2 with 57 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 11 days from Q1. The decrease in days was driven by strong resales and management of channel inventory.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 67.6%, approximately 70 basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by strong operational execution and benefiting from the transition to sell-in accounting at Avnet North America. Special items in Q2 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions.
Operating expenses excluding special items were $201 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter due to an extra week in the quarter, the full quarter impact of our annual comp adjustments in September and higher profit sharing. Special items in Q2 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges.
Q2 operating income excluding special items was $220 million. Operating margin at 35.3% of revenue is approximately flat from the prior quarter and up 490 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy.
Q2 GAAP tax rate excluding special items was 14%. Concerning tax reform, the key benefit for Maxim is improved access to international cash, providing greater flexibility for our use of cash. Our Q2 GAAP tax provision included a $244 million charge comprised primarily of an estimated $427 million tax on the deemed repatriation of historical international profits, partially offset by adjustments to reserves. 
The repatriation tax is payable over 8 years, with the first annual payment estimated at $34 million due in September 2018. At this time, we continue to estimate our long-term GAAP tax rate excluding special items at 14%. We are continuing to review our long-term tax -- long-term rate in light of the tax reform and we'll update as appropriate. 
GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.65, up 41% from the same quarter a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $230 million or 37% of revenue. Q2 inventory days ended at 126, up 9 days from Q1. Inventory dollars were up 6% from the prior quarter as we prepare for a strong revenue ramp in Q3. 
Gross capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were higher in the quarter for tooling to add capacity at a remaining fab in Oregon and for new testers to support automotive growth. As a result of tax reform, U.S. capital expenditures after September 27 will be fully and immediately expensed for tax purposes.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $849 million or 36% of revenue and up 27% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $77 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.5 million shares. Dividends totaled $101 million in the quarter or $0.36 per share. As stated earlier, we will now return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders with a 17% increase in our dividend to $0.42 per share and an increased rate of stock repurchase. The dividend yield after this 17% increase in the dividend is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $49 million in the second quarter to $2.82 billion.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q3 backlog was $446 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $620 million to $660 million. Q3 revenue is expected to be above seasonal and up compared to the same quarter last year, driven by growth across all of our major markets. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin.
Special items in Q3 gross margin are estimated at approximately $11 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q3 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the low to mid-$190s million, down from Q2, given a regular 13-week quarter and reflecting profit sharing. We are continuing to tightly manage costs consistent with our updated business model.
Special items in Q3 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q3 excluding special items is expected to be 14%, flat from Q2. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.66 to $0.72.
In summary, we expect continued growth in Q3 revenue compared to the same quarter last year. We are growing content in Automotive, Industrial, Consumer and Data Center, which is helping to drive growth. And we are executing to the updated financial model disclosed a few months ago, resulting in strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tunç."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year,",1181,"All right. Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth was led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Automotive with continued solid company profitability. Looking forward, we expect strong growth in our March quarter, with significant growth in Automotive, Industrial and Consumer compared to the same quarter last year. Our profitability and revenue growth is enabling exceptionally strong earnings power and cash flow, giving us confidence to increase our return of capital to shareholders.
I would like to remind investors that our December quarter revenue included the benefit of the transition to Avnet North America sell-in accounting. December was also a 14-week quarter. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude these factors.
First, I will comment on Automotive. As we highlighted at the Consumer Electronics Show, our relationship with NVIDIA is alive and well. Maxim's leading-edge power management and serial link solutions continued to be part of NVIDIA's next-generation autonomous driving platforms. 
In addition to our strong NVIDIA partnership, we've continued to sell automotive power and interface products attached to multiple partner platforms at many automotive customers. In the December quarter, automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the March quarter, we forecast continued sequential growth from an above-seasonal December quarter, primarily driven by continued strength in our battery management system business.
Long term, we expect low teens growth for Automotive business, driven in part by strong market acceptance of our battery management products for electric vehicles. Maxim has design wins at 28 different OEMs, which are producing over 70 different car models, some of which are yet to be released. We won these designs in many different regions of the world. Today, Maxim's revenue from EV opportunities is still relatively modest at roughly 1/10 of our total Automotive revenue. However, as the EV car sales increased due to government initiatives and greater affordability for consumers we expect BMS to be a strong growth driver for Maxim.
We're in the early days in the electronification of cars, and more cars are becoming equipped with driver assist or ADAS features. ADAS electronic controlled units are expected to double in 5 years according to third-party research. Car is increasingly becoming a data center on wheels with high-end processors, multiple displays, sensors and cameras, all requiring efficient power management and point-to-point high-speed data transmission. 
Collision warning and lane departure systems that were once only available in high-end cars will soon be options or standard equipment in midrange cars and trucks. Maxim has a complete portfolio of GMSL serial link interfaces and power management ICs that connect and provide power to these safety systems. We have over $100 of potential infotainment and ADAS content opportunity in a premium car today. We expect this to double to $200 of opportunity for a premium car within the next 5 years.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. Our December quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up compared to the same quarter last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our safety -- and our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
In the quarter, we introduced new factory automation products that provide robust communication links and interfaces needed for the factory floor. Our new family of Controlled Area Network, or CAN, interface products provide superior electrostatic discharge protection and are designed to be used in harsh industrial environments that require a high-voltage fault protection. 
In addition, we introduced a new family of RS45 interface products that double data transmission speeds. These products can also drive longer cable links that are suitable for motion control systems in a factory setting. These new products augment our existing leading portfolio in I/O and communication and industrial power applications. Our factory automation family of products are being widely deployed, especially in Europe and Japan.
In our broad market business, we entered into 2 new distribution agreements in Japan. We expect these new distribution partners to enable us to extend our reach in the region, augmenting our online presence and deepening our focus on the industrial end market. We continue to improve our online support and website storefront and we're increasing the use of analytics to identify, track and maximize the value of opportunities within the broad market.
In the December quarter, our total distribution channel sales was 47% of Maxim revenue, excluding revenue from the transition of Avnet North America to sell-in accounting. Our expanded distribution channel partnerships are bearing fruit by bringing Maxim's products to more small and medium business customers. Through this strategy, SMB customer revenue grew 24% compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the December quarter, automotive and industrial markets together contributed half of total company revenue.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the December quarter, Comms and Data Center was flat from the same quarter last year. Growth in 100G optical products and 12-volt server power from the data center was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. We expect comms infrastructure to be sequentially up in the March quarter but down from the same quarter a year ago. We anticipate continued data center revenue growth in the March quarter, up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year. This strong growth is driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, our Consumer business was down from the same quarter a year ago due to smartphones, partially offset by growth in our broad-based Consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming products. In the March quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and from the same quarter last year, driven by above-average peak shipments for smartphones.
In Consumer, we continued to focus on our strategy to broaden our business into a proliferation of smart devices with a strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals.
Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably and to improve our financial stability. We are demonstrating top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center and our Consumer business is stabilizing. Our broad market strategy is demonstrating revenue growth and enhanced profitability through our distribution partnership initiatives and improved reach to small and medium business customers. And we are focused on expanding our customer base so that we can sustain growth over the long term. And finally, we remain committed to maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by today's announcement that we will increase our return of capital to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathy."

And the normal step-up for you guys in the March quarter is about 4% to 6% sequentially. So can you just help us understand a couple of things here? What is driving the sharp acceleration here relative to normal seasonality? It looks like it's Industrial and Consumer but just at accelerated levels. Is it just more companies ramping factory automation products? Is it an acceleration of the broad market initiatives?

Our verticals, which are a smaller part of our Industrial, are also showing some good growth in the quarter. And of course, Auto is seasonally up after a very strong December quarter. So overall, we're seeing good growth in -- I mean, even in Comm and Data Center, we're guiding that up on the strength of the Data Center side of the business as where actually I think the infrastructure side has been a little weaker.

I think from our point of view, the biggest benefit of tax reform is access to our global cash, greater flexibility. As I indicated from a P&L point of view, the -- our tax rate at this point is -- appears to be relatively unchanged. Obviously, we're still studying that, but for now it looks like it's still going to be around that 14%. But with that -- with tax reform and greater access to that -- to our offshore capital, that does kind of remove one of the risk factors that we always looked at when we thought about the 80% return of capital. And because at the time, right about 35%, 40% of our free cash flow was generated offshore. Now that we have access to all of our cash, we've always been very comfortable with the sustainability of our free cash flow model and feel very comfortable returning that to shareholders 100%. And so that's something we wanted to do, and we now have the opportunity to do that and I think it just highlights the strength of our model, which is kind of growing the top line, improving profitability, low CapEx intensity and the ability, in a very sustainable way, to return that to shareholders. So that's why we went from the 80% to 100%. When we think about the dividend, probably 2 things to think about there. First off, we normally look at this once a year. Usually, it's in the summertime and we usually announce something in July during our Q4 earnings release. Since that time, our business has continued to do very well. And we do have kind of continued confidence in our growth and profitability initiatives. And so that certainly helped us from the confidence in increasing the dividend. The other thing we did do, though, is in thinking about that increase from 80% to 100% and how we allocate that between dividend and buyback, we always want to make sure when we think about our dividend that we don't get too far out in front and there's still some -- it's still early days on tax reform. So we took about 1/3 of that increase and allocated it to the dividend and about 2/3 that gets allocated to the buyback. I think we felt, as a management team, as a board, comfortable with that. We'll continue to our normal cadence of looking at our capital return in the summer as we have in the past. But I think today, with access to our global capital and the continued strength in the business, we felt comfortable both 80% -- going from 80% to 100% and increasing the dividend by $0.06 or 17%."

We said that would be, again, over several years. We didn't give an exact time because it was somewhat dependent on top line growth. But we're -- we continue to be very focused on free cash flow.

And our guidance in Q3 is in line with that assessment. Internally, what we look at is what kind of lead times are customers giving us when they ask for products. And that gives you an indication of whether they are concerned about constraints or they're trying to take too much inventory and we look at that. We also look at inventory in the channel, which obviously we control to some extent. But our lead times are within normal range and we're not experiencing any supply constraints.

So it's all the result of focus in the company. We've been investing in systems and processes to help sell our products to a broad base of customers. We've got design tools, we've got a better website. I think we have stronger disti partnerships, more distributors selling our products. So all of that is really helping our customer reach. And as a result of that, we're seeing what you mentioned, stronger growth in our broad-based business, which is really great because it improves our revenue stability and obviously the profitability of the company. So it's all part of the strategy."

And that really is driven by the need for cleaner air, the need -- all the needs that governments want to make sure happen and they have subsidies going on. Much of the lumpiness comes from subsidies going in and out of China. And I don't know if that's going to become something that's more permanent or not. It's hard for us to predict that. But as far as we're concerned, the fluctuations that occur quarterly basis really don't matter too much as long as the general direction or the moving average is to the right and higher every quarter."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of our company's founding. Over the last 3.5 decades, we have built a durable business through our expertise and high-performance analog, particularly in power management products. 
We have built a strong brand with our customers in solving their toughest problems. I really believe Maxim has one of the finest engineering teams in analog in the world, and our customers tell us that the performance of our products is what sets us apart from our competitors and what gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end markets. 
Let me now turn to this quarter's results. As a reminder, during last year's June quarter, we transitioned 1 of our U.S. distributors to sell in accounting. During our commentary today, we will exclude that component of revenue from the June quarter of last year. 
We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by our power management products in Consumer, Automotive, and Industrial, with continued solid profitability. Looking forward, we continue to expect significant growth drivers in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center. 
First, I will comment on Automotive. We continue to see strong demand in battery management systems, or BMS, especially in China. In the March quarter, we introduced a high-current version of our BMS product design for electric buses. This product has already owned a significant new design win in China. On a year-over-year basis, our Automotive design wins continue to grow into double digits. This growth is led by power, battery management and serial link products, giving us confidence in a year-over-year revenue growth in the low-teens in Automotive. Quality and safety are paramount to Automotive customers. Automotive safety certifications, called ASIL levels, address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. It covers the entire Automotive safety life cycle from management, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning of an electrical system. Maxim has the highest rated ASIL-compliant battery management system in the industry, and our ASIL ratings in power management and serial link interface products differentiate us in the market as well. These safety certifications become increasingly important to our customers as drivers content continue to grow. This higher safety trend plays to our strengths in product design for Automotive. In the March quarter, Automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the June quarter, we expect strong sequential growth, driven by power management products for infotainment, continued momentum in our battery management systems business, and ADAS products. In fact, in the June quarter, we expect high-teens year-over-year growth in Automotive. 
Let me next turn into the Industrial market. Our March quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within Industrial, the core segment let our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives. We also closed the small acquisition in industrial communications area. In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens compared to the same period last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and for our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners. We continue to broaden our customer engagements in factory automation across customers in Europe, the Americas, Japan and China. Although these are early days in factory automation deployment, we estimate that in 2018, industries installed base of I/O-Link communication will reach 10 million units globally, doubling last year's installed base. Sensors, actuators and programmable logic controllers in our smart factory require efficient power management that is robust for harsh industrial environments, minimizes heat generation and fits into small footprints. These requirements play through our strengths. In the March quarter, we introduced a new line of 3x3 millimeter highly efficient power modules that integrate the inductor DC to DC converter. This remarkable size addresses the most space constrained applications in the Industrial market. In medical, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year growth from a smaller revenue base in authentication products. These products ensure that only genuine components are used with medical electronic, such as pulse proximitors, surgical staplers, dialysis machines and clinical dosimeters. We expect growth of this business over the coming quarters. In our broad market business, we continue to grow resales through our distribution partners. We have extended our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the March quarter, distribution channel resales grew 25% from the same period last year. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, comps in Data Center was flat from the same period last year, with strong growth in optical products in the Data Center, offset by broad-based office in communications infrastructure. In the June quarter, we anticipate comps in data center revenue to be up sequentially and up from the same period last year. This growth is again driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack conductivity. 
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, our Consumer business was strongly up from the same period a year ago due to above-average flagship smartphone shipments and growth in our broad-based Consumer business. In the June quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to significantly lower unit shipments of flagship smartphone products, partially offset by growth in tablets and wearables. We expect Consumer to be flat in the June quarter from the same period last year. As such, Consumer is no longer a headwind to our growth. In Consumer, we've continued to execute on our strategy to broaden our business into proliferation of smart devices, a strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals. 
To summarize, Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue; to do so profitably; with the continued financial stability. We're delivering on all 3. With a strong top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center and our Consumer business is no more broad-based. Through our distribution partnership initiatives, our broad market strategy is delivering growth, enhance profitability and improve reach to small and medium business customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is driving top line revenue growth. Operating margin exceeded 37% in the quarter due to our strong execution. Free cash flow is on track to our $3.50 per share target. And finally, we are delivering on our commitment to return 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Let me now discuss our third quarter financial results. Revenue for Q3 was $649 million, up 12% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 31% Consumer, 27% from Industrial, 20% Automotive, 19% Comm and Data Center, and 3%, Computing. As expected, Consumer increase in Q3 is due to an above-average smartphone shipment ramp and we expect Consumer revenue to normalize and Q4. 
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 43% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter. We ended Q3 with 56 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 1 day from Q2. The decrease was driven by active management of channel inventory and continued strength in resales. We are aware of reports of double ordering, so we checked with our 2 largest distributors, and they stated that, with our stable lead times, they are not aware of excess orders. Our delivery lead times are 5 to 7 weeks, and have been in this range for over 6 years. Also, we do not have capacity constraints. Thus, there is no need for customers to double order or build excess inventory. We will continue to monitor this issue closely. 
Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 67.2%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to the transition to sell an accounting in Q2. Q3 gross margin is approximately 200 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by strong operational execution. Special items in Q3 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisition. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $196 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter due to a 14-week quarter in Q2. Special items in Q3 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $240 million, operating margin of 37.1% of revenue is up 180 basis points from the prior quarter, and up 410 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focus on the investment strategy. Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. This rate is lower from our previous level of 14% due to tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 32% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $99 million in the third quarter to $2.72 billion. Q3 inventory days ended at 117, down 9 days from Q2. Inventory dollars were up 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $843 million or 34% of revenue, and up 15% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.1 million shares. This was up significantly from the prior quarter as we increased our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. Dividends totaled $118 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. This was a 17% increase from the prior quarter, also due to the increase in our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. Our dividend yield is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q4 backlog was a $436 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expect returns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $610 million to $650 million. Q4 revenue is expected to be up approximately 8% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year on a normalized basis, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and Automotive. We normalized last year's June quarter results for the transition to sell an accounting at 1 North American distributor, which delivered an incremental $20 million of revenue in the quarter. Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds, providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at approximately $12 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low to mid-190s, down from Q3, with continued tight cost controls, consistent with our updated business model. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q4, excluding special items, is expected to be 12%, flat from Q3, and at a lower rate than prior estimates due to tax reform. For Q4, GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range at $0.67 to $0.73. 
In summary, we expect growth in Q4 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by strength in Automotive and Industrial. We continue to execute to our updated financial model, resulting in stronger earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy."

So we obviously had strong revenue and due to the kind of the early ramp of the smartphone shipments. If we look at distribution overall, resales were up 25% year-over-year. So we're still seeing tremendous strength in that business. And that was really across-the-board. China and Japan were up around 30% year-over-year; Europe, Korea were up 20%; and even the Americas were up around 10% year-over-year. And so they've kind of recovered and shown that return to growth. So that changes just solely due to the kind of the early ramp in Consumer. That goes away in Q4, that comes down, and you'll see distribution back to the normal trend line that we are on before."

It actually -- they actually, from a timing point of view, shifted even more revenue than we had expected from Q4 into Q3 and, so now, that reflected in our guidance. And so if you look at the Q4 guidance, if you -- there's the issue on kind of that shipment timing. If you take that out, you have our Industrial -- our Automotive businesses, which is up in the high-teens year-over-year, you have our Industrial business, which is up in the mid-teens year-over-year.

And that actually bodes really well for Maxim. It also bodes well for 48-volt or higher distribution of power. So what we're seeing is the direction the Data Center market is taking is in favor of for distribution, but also, goes into the sweet spot of Maxim Solutions in terms of the end conversions. So these things take multiple years to actually turn into revenue. But the leading indicators are essentially telling us that the market dynamics are beneficial for us.

Of those segments, infotainment is the largest revenue generator today. And that's growing pretty solidly, but probably closer to the growth rate of the overall Automotive. But the pieces that are growing the fastest as a percentage are driver assist and BMS. But just to give you some numbers, I think that infotainment section of the business is the dominant piece. It's about 2/3 of the business, and 2/3 of it there, and the other ones are divided off this small. So it's safety security segment, which is ADAS basically, it's maybe about 10%, and powertrain is maybe about 10%-or-so, so it's in that range, to give you an idea. Those 2 10% businesses are growing really fast, they're in hyper growth, and then in infotainment, it's kind of growing closer to the growth rate of the Automotive business, so basically, which is in the low-teens. So that's kind of a background.

That business is growing very, very fast. And as we've said, sort of around off a small base, kind of 50% kind of year-on-year growth rate. And so that, comm and data center isn't really seasonal.

95673,558267079,1439403,"Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 deca",1064,"Thank you, Kathy. 
Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 decades, we have built a durable business through our expertise in high-performance analog, particularly in power management products. We have built a strong brand with our customers in solving their toughest problems. 
I really believe Maxim has one of the finest engineering teams in analog in the world, and our customers tell us that the performance of our products is what sets us apart from our competitors and what gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end markets. 
Let me now turn to this quarter's results. As a reminder, during last year's June quarter, we transitioned one of our U.S. distributors to sell-in accounting. During our commentary today, we will exclude that component of revenue from the June quarter of last year. 
We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by our power management products in Consumer, Automotive and Industrial, with continued solid profitability. Looking forward, we continue to expect significant growth drivers in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center. 
First, I will comment on Automotive. We continue to see strong demand in battery management systems, or BMS, especially in China. In the March quarter, we introduced a high-current version of our BMS product designed for electric buses. This product has already earned a significant new design win in China. On a year-over-year basis, our Automotive design wins continue to grow in the double digits. This growth is led by power, battery management and serial link products, giving us confidence in year-over-year revenue growth in the low teens in Automotive. 
Quality and safety are paramount to Automotive customers. Automotive safety certifications, called ASIL levels, address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. It covers the entire automotive safety life cycle from management, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning of an electrical system. Maxim has the highest-rated ASIL-compliant battery management system in the industry, and our ASIL ratings in power management and serial link interface products differentiate us in the market as well. These safety certifications become increasingly important to our customers as driverless content continue to grow. This higher safety trend plays to our strengths in product design for Automotive. 
In the March quarter, Automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the June quarter, we expect strong sequential growth, driven by power management products for infotainment, continued momentum in our battery management system business and ADAS products. In fact, in the June quarter, we expect high-teens year-over-year growth in Automotive. 
Let me next turn into the Industrial market. Our March quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within Industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives. We also closed a small acquisition in the industrial communications area. 
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens compared to the same period last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners. 
We continue to broaden our customer engagements in factory automation across customers in Europe, the Americas, Japan and China. Although these are early days in factory automation deployment, we estimate that in 2018, industries installed base of I/O-Link communication will reach 10 million units globally, doubling last year's installed base. 
Sensors, actuators and programmable logic controllers in a smart factory require efficient power management that is robust for harsh industrial environments, minimizes heat generation and fits into small footprints. These requirements play to our strengths. 
In the March quarter, we introduced a new line of 3x3 millimeter highly efficient power management modules that integrate the inductor and DC to DC converter. This remarkable size addresses the most space-constrained applications in the industrial market. 
In medical, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication products. These products ensure that only genuine components are used with medical electronics such as pulse oximeters, surgical staplers, dialysis machines and clinical dosimeters. We expect growth of this business over the coming quarters. 
In our broad market business, we continue to grow resales through our distribution partners. We have extended our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the March quarter, distribution channel resales grew 25% from the same period last year. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, comps in Data Center was flat from the same period last year, with strong growth in optical products for the Data Center, offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. In the June quarter, we anticipate comps in data center revenue to be up sequentially and up from the same period last year. This growth is again driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack conductivity. 
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, our Consumer business was strongly up from the same period a year ago due to above-average flagship smartphone shipments and growth in our broad-based Consumer business. 
In the June quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to significantly lower unit shipments of flagship smartphone products, partially offset by growth in tablets and wearables. We expect Consumer to be flat in the June quarter from the same period last year. As such, Consumer is no longer a headwind to our growth. 
In Consumer, we continue to execute on our strategy to broaden our business into proliferation of smart devices, a strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals. 
To summarize, Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably, with the continued financial stability. We are delivering on all three. We have strong top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center, and our Consumer business is now more broad based. Through our distribution partnership initiatives, our broad market strategy is delivering growth, enhanced profitability and improved reach to small and medium business customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is driving top line revenue growth. Operating margin exceeded 37% in the quarter due to our strong execution. Free cash flow is on track to our $3.50 per share target, and finally, we are delivering on our commitment to return 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Let me now discuss our third quarter financial results. Revenue for Q3 was $649 million, up 12% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 31% Consumer, 27% from Industrial, 20% Automotive, 19% Comm and Data Center, and 3% Computing. As expected, Consumer increase in Q3 is due to an above-average smartphone shipment ramp and we expect Consumer revenue to normalize in Q4. 
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 43% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter. We ended Q3 with 56 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 1 day from Q2. The decrease was driven by active management of channel inventory and continued strength in resales. 
We are aware of reports of double ordering, so we checked with our 2 largest distributors and they stated that with our stable lead times, they are not aware of excess orders. Our delivery lead times are 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. Also, we do not have capacity constraints. Thus, there is no need for customers to double order or build excess inventory. We will continue to monitor this issue closely. 
Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 67.2%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to the transition to sell-in accounting in Q2. Q3 gross margin is approximately 200 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by strong operational execution. Special items in Q3 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisition. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $196 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter due to a 14-week quarter in Q2. Special items in Q3 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $240 million. Operating margin at 37.1% of revenue is up 180 basis points from the prior quarter and up 410 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focus R&D investment strategy. 
Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. This rate is lower from our previous level of 14% due to tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 32% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $99 million in the third quarter to $2.72 billion. 
Q3 inventory days ended at 117, down 9 days from Q2. Inventory dollars were up 5% from the prior quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $843 million or 34% of revenue, and up 15% over the same quarter last year. 
Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q3 as we bought back approximately 2.1 million shares. This was up significantly from the prior quarter as we increased our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $118 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. This was a 17% increase from the prior quarter, also due to the increase in our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. Our dividend yield is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q4 backlog was a $436 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $610 million to $650 million. Q4 revenue is expected to be up approximately 8% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year on a normalized basis, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and Automotive. We normalized last year's June quarter results for the transition to sell-in accounting at one North American distributor, which delivered an incremental $20 million of revenue in the quarter. 
Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds, providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at approximately $12 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low to mid-190s, down from Q3, with continued tight cost controls, consistent with our updated business model. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Our tax rate for Q4, excluding special items, is expected to be 12%, flat from Q3 and at a lower rate than prior estimates due to tax reform. 
For Q4, GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.67 to $0.73. 
In summary, we expect growth in Q4 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by strength in Automotive and Industrial. We continue to execute to our updated financial model, resulting in stronger earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy."

China and Japan were up around 30% year-over-year; Europe, Korea were up 20%; and even the Americas were up around 10% year-over-year. And so they've kind of recovered and shown that return to growth. So that change is just solely due to the kind of the early ramp in Consumer. That goes away in Q4.

But as you alluded, most of the revenue that we're getting with quick ramps is happening in China."

But the pieces that are growing the fastest as a percentage are driver assist and BMS. But just to give you some numbers, I think that the infotainment section of the business is the dominant piece. It's about 2/3 of the business and 2/3 of -- there, and the other ones are divided off the small. So it's safety and security segment, which is ADAS, basically. It's maybe about 10%, and powertrain is maybe about 10% or so. It's in that range, to give you an idea. Those 2 10%-businesses are growing really fast. They're in hyper growth. And then infotainment is kind of growing closer to the growth rate of the Automotive business, so basically -- which is in the low teens. So that's kind of a background. So we're happy with the investment. We're happy with the -- and more importantly, customers are really happy with the performance of our products.

But again, we don't have a lot of unique insights into the comm infrastructure business, and we have a very broad-based sort of catalog-driven business. Obviously, on the optical side, we're in kind of hyper growth, and literally, there's nothing seasonal about that. That is just as people adopt 100G connectivity, optical connectivity, that business is growing very, very fast. And as we've said, sort of around off a small base, this 50% year-on-year growth rate. And so that -- so comm and data center isn't really seasonal. The comm infrastructure side is still about 2/3 of the business, and the data center is still about 1/3.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 decades, we have built a durable business through our expertise in high-performance analog, particularly in power management products. We have built a strong brand with our customers in solving their toughest problems. 
I really believe Maxim has one of the finest engineering teams in analog in the world, and our customers tell us that the performance of our products is what sets us apart from our competitors and what gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end markets. 
Let me now turn to this quarter's results. As a reminder, during last year's June quarter, we transitioned one of our U.S. distributors to sell-in accounting. During our commentary today, we will exclude that component of revenue from the June quarter of last year. 
We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by our power management products in Consumer, Automotive and Industrial, with continued solid profitability. Looking forward, we continue to expect significant growth drivers in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center. 
First, I will comment on Automotive. We continue to see strong demand in battery management systems, or BMS, especially in China. In the March quarter, we introduced a high-current version of our BMS product designed for electric buses. This product has already earned a significant new design win in China. On a year-over-year basis, our Automotive design wins continue to grow in the double digits. This growth is led by power, battery management and serial link products, giving us confidence in year-over-year revenue growth in the low teens in Automotive. 
Quality and safety are paramount to Automotive customers. Automotive safety certifications, called ASIL levels, address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. It covers the entire automotive safety life cycle from management, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning of an electrical system. Maxim has the highest-rated ASIL-compliant battery management system in the industry, and our ASIL ratings in power management and serial link interface products differentiate us in the market as well. These safety certifications become increasingly important to our customers as driverless content continue to grow. This higher safety trend plays to our strengths in product design for Automotive. 
In the March quarter, Automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the June quarter, we expect strong sequential growth, driven by power management products for infotainment, continued momentum in our battery management system business and ADAS products. In fact, in the June quarter, we expect high-teens year-over-year growth in Automotive. 
Let me next turn into the Industrial market. Our March quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within Industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives. We also closed a small acquisition in the industrial communications area. 
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens compared to the same period last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners. 
We continue to broaden our customer engagements in factory automation across customers in Europe, the Americas, Japan and China. Although these are early days in factory automation deployment, we estimate that in 2018, the industry's installed base of I/O-Link communication will reach 10 million units globally, doubling last year's installed base. 
Sensors, actuators and programmable logic controllers in a smart factory require efficient power management that is robust for harsh industrial environments, minimizes heat generation and fits into small footprints. These requirements play to our strengths. 
In the March quarter, we introduced a new line of 3x3 millimeter highly efficient power management modules that integrate the inductor and DC to DC converter. This remarkable size addresses the most space-constrained applications in the industrial market. 
In medical, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication products. These products ensure that only genuine components are used with medical electronics such as pulse oximeters, surgical staplers, dialysis machines and clinical dosimeters. We expect growth of this business over the coming quarters. 
In our broad market business, we continue to grow resales through our distribution partners. We have extended our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the March quarter, distribution channel resales grew 25% from the same period last year. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, Comms and Data Center was flat from the same period last year, with strong growth in optical products for the data center, offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. In the June quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be up sequentially and up from the same period last year. This growth is again driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack conductivity. 
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, our Consumer business was strongly up from the same period a year ago due to above-average flagship smartphone shipments and growth in our broad-based Consumer business. 
In the June quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to significantly lower unit shipments of flagship smartphone products, partially offset by growth in tablets and wearables. We expect Consumer to be flat in the June quarter from the same period last year. As such, Consumer is no longer a headwind to our growth. 
In Consumer, we continue to execute on our strategy to broaden our business into proliferation of smart devices, with strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals. 
To summarize, Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably, with continued financial stability. We are delivering on all 3. We have strong top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center, and our Consumer business is now more broad based. Through our distribution partnership initiatives, our broad market strategy is delivering growth, enhanced profitability and improved reach to small and medium business customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is driving top line revenue growth. Operating margin exceeded 37% in the quarter due to our strong execution. Free cash flow is on track to our $3.50 per share target, and finally, we are delivering on our commitment to return 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Let me now discuss our third quarter financial results. Revenue for Q3 was $649 million, up 12% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 31% Consumer, 27% from Industrial, 20% Automotive, 19% Comm and Data Center, and 3% Computing. As expected, Consumer increase in Q3 is due to an above-average smartphone shipment ramp and we expect Consumer revenue to normalize in Q4. 
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 43% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter. We ended Q3 with 56 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 1 day from Q2. The decrease was driven by active management of channel inventory and continued strength in resales. 
We are aware of reports of double ordering, so we checked with our 2 largest distributors and they stated that with our stable lead times, they are not aware of excess orders. Our delivery lead times are 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. Also, we do not have capacity constraints. Thus, there is no need for customers to double order or build excess inventory. We will continue to monitor this issue closely. 
Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 67.2%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to the transition to sell-in accounting in Q2. Q3 gross margin is approximately 200 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by strong operational execution. Special items in Q3 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisition. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $196 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter due to a 14-week quarter in Q2. Special items in Q3 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $240 million. Operating margin at 37.1% of revenue is up 180 basis points from the prior quarter and up 410 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy. 
Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. This rate is lower from our previous level of 14% due to tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 32% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $99 million in the third quarter to $2.72 billion. 
Q3 inventory days ended at 117, down 9 days from Q2. Inventory dollars were up 5% from the prior quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $843 million or 34% of revenue, and up 15% over the same quarter last year. 
Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q3 as we bought back approximately 2.1 million shares. This was up significantly from the prior quarter as we increased our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $118 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. This was a 17% increase from the prior quarter, also due to the increase in our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. Our dividend yield is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q4 backlog was a $436 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $610 million to $650 million. Q4 revenue is expected to be up approximately 8% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year on a normalized basis, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and Automotive. We normalized last year's June quarter results for the transition to sell-in accounting at one North American distributor, which delivered an incremental $20 million of revenue in the quarter. 
Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds, providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at approximately $12 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low to [ mid-190s ], down from Q3, with continued tight cost controls, consistent with our updated business model. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Our tax rate for Q4, excluding special items, is expected to be 12%, flat from Q3 and at a lower rate than prior estimates due to tax reform. 
For Q4, GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.67 to $0.73. 
In summary, we expect growth in Q4 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by strength in Automotive and Industrial. We continue to execute to our updated financial model, resulting in stronger earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy."

And that actually bodes really well for Maxim. And it also bodes well for 48-volt or higher voltage distribution of power. So what we're seeing is the direction the data center market is taking is in favor of 48-volt distribution but also goes into the sweet spot of Maxim solutions in terms of the end conversions. So these things take multiple years to actually turn into revenue, but the leading indicators are essentially telling us that the market dynamics are beneficial for us.

So I think it's a good opportunity story for us.

But the pieces that are growing the fastest as a percentage are driver assist and BMS. But just to give you some numbers, I think that the infotainment section of the business is the dominant piece. It's about 2/3 of the business and 2/3 of -- there, and the other ones are divided off the small. So it's safety and security segment, which is ADAS, basically. It's maybe about 10%, and powertrain is maybe about 10% or so. It's in that range, to give you an idea. Those 2 10%-businesses are growing really fast. They're in hyper growth.

That is just as people adopt 100G connectivity, optical connectivity, that business is growing very, very fast. And as we've said, sort of around off a small base, kind of this 50% year-on-year growth rate. And so that -- so Comm and Data Center isn't really seasonal. The comm infrastructure side is still about 2/3 of the business, and the data center is still about 1/3. So that's still going to influence the overall growth rate. Obviously, as the data center continues to grow and becomes a larger percent, it will have a larger impact on the overall growth rate of the company as that business continues to grow very strongly."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 deca",1063,"Thank you, Kathy. 
Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 decades, we have built a durable business through our expertise in high-performance analog, particularly in power management products. We have built a strong brand with our customers in solving their toughest problems. 
I really believe Maxim has one of the finest engineering teams in analog in the world, and our customers tell us that the performance of our products is what sets us apart from our competitors and what gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end markets. 
Let me now turn to this quarter's results. As a reminder, during last year's June quarter, we transitioned one of our U.S. distributors to sell-in accounting. During our commentary today, we will exclude that component of revenue from the June quarter of last year. 
We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by our power management products in Consumer, Automotive and Industrial, with continued solid profitability. Looking forward, we continue to expect significant growth drivers in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center. 
First, I will comment on Automotive. We continue to see strong demand in battery management systems, or BMS, especially in China. In the March quarter, we introduced a high-current version of our BMS product designed for electric buses. This product has already earned a significant new design win in China. On a year-over-year basis, our Automotive design wins continue to grow in the double digits. This growth is led by power, battery management and serial link products, giving us confidence in year-over-year revenue growth in the low teens in Automotive. 
Quality and safety are paramount to Automotive customers. Automotive safety certifications, called ASIL levels, address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. It covers the entire automotive safety life cycle from management, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning of an electrical system. Maxim has the highest-rated ASIL-compliant battery management system in the industry, and our ASIL ratings in power management and serial link interface products differentiate us in the market as well. These safety certifications become increasingly important to our customers as driverless content continue to grow. This higher safety trend plays to our strengths in product design for Automotive. 
In the March quarter, Automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the June quarter, we expect strong sequential growth, driven by power management products for infotainment, continued momentum in our battery management system business and ADAS products. In fact, in the June quarter, we expect high-teens year-over-year growth in Automotive. 
Let me next turn into the Industrial market. Our March quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within Industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives. We also closed a small acquisition in the industrial communications area. 
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens compared to the same period last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners. 
We continue to broaden our customer engagements in factory automation across customers in Europe, the Americas, Japan and China. Although these are early days in factory automation deployment, we estimate that in 2018, the industry's installed base of I/O-Link communication will reach 10 million units globally, doubling last year's installed base. 
Sensors, actuators and programmable logic controllers in a smart factory require efficient power management that is robust for harsh industrial environments, minimizes heat generation and fits into small footprints. These requirements play to our strengths. 
In the March quarter, we introduced a new line of 3x3 millimeter highly efficient power management modules that integrate the inductor and DC to DC converter. This remarkable size addresses the most space-constrained applications in the industrial market. 
In medical, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication products. These products ensure that only genuine components are used with medical electronics such as pulse oximeters, surgical staplers, dialysis machines and clinical dosimeters. We expect growth of this business over the coming quarters. 
In our broad market business, we continue to grow resales through our distribution partners. We have extended our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the March quarter, distribution channel resales grew 25% from the same period last year. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, Comms and Data Center was flat from the same period last year, with strong growth in optical products for the data center, offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure. In the June quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be up sequentially and up from the same period last year. This growth is again driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack conductivity. 
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, our Consumer business was strongly up from the same period a year ago due to above-average flagship smartphone shipments and growth in our broad-based Consumer business. 
In the June quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to significantly lower unit shipments of flagship smartphone products, partially offset by growth in tablets and wearables. We expect Consumer to be flat in the June quarter from the same period last year. As such, Consumer is no longer a headwind to our growth. 
In Consumer, we continue to execute on our strategy to broaden our business into proliferation of smart devices, with strong market acceptance of our products in hearables and peripherals. 
To summarize, Maxim's priorities are to grow revenue, to do so profitably, with continued financial stability. We are delivering on all 3. We have strong top line growth in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center, and our Consumer business is now more broad-based. Through our distribution partnership initiatives, our broad market strategy is delivering growth, enhanced profitability and improved reach to small and medium business customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

We continue to successfully execute on our updated business model and grow our top line. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is driving top line revenue growth. Operating margin exceeded 37% in the quarter due to our strong execution. Free cash flow is on track to our $3.50 per share target, and finally, we are delivering on our commitment to return 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Let me now discuss our third quarter financial results. Revenue for Q3 was $649 million, up 12% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 31% Consumer, 27% from Industrial, 20% Automotive, 19% Comm and Data Center, and 3% Computing. As expected, Consumer increase in Q3 is due to an above-average smartphone shipment ramp and we expect Consumer revenue to normalize in Q4. 
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 43% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter. We ended Q3 with 56 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down 1 day from Q2. The decrease was driven by active management of channel inventory and continued strength in resales. 
We are aware of reports of double ordering, so we checked with our 2 largest distributors and they stated that with our stable lead times, they are not aware of excess orders. Our delivery lead times are 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. Also, we do not have capacity constraints. Thus, there is no need for customers to double order or build excess inventory. We will continue to monitor this issue closely. 
Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 67.2%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to the transition to sell-in accounting in Q2. Q3 gross margin is approximately 200 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by strong operational execution. Special items in Q3 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisition. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $196 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter due to a 14-week quarter in Q2. Special items in Q3 operating expenses included acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $240 million. Operating margin at 37.1% of revenue is up 180 basis points from the prior quarter and up 410 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This improvement in operating margin was driven by revenue growth, our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy. 
Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. This rate is lower from our previous level of 14% due to tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 32% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $99 million in the third quarter to $2.72 billion. 
Q3 inventory days ended at 117, down 9 days from Q2. Inventory dollars were up 5% from the prior quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $843 million or 34% of revenue, and up 15% over the same quarter last year. 
Our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q3 as we bought back approximately 2.1 million shares. This was up significantly from the prior quarter as we increased our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $118 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. This was a 17% increase from the prior quarter, also due to the increase in our return of capital policy from 80% to 100% of free cash flow. Our dividend yield is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q4 backlog was a $436 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $610 million to $650 million. Q4 revenue is expected to be up approximately 8% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year on a normalized basis, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and Automotive. We normalized last year's June quarter results for the transition to sell-in accounting at one North American distributor, which delivered an incremental $20 million of revenue in the quarter. 
Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds, providing a long-term upward bias to gross margin. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at approximately $12 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low to [ mid-190s ], down from Q3, with continued tight cost controls, consistent with our updated business model. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $1 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. 
Our tax rate for Q4, excluding special items, is expected to be 12%, flat from Q3 and at a lower rate than prior estimates due to tax reform. 
For Q4, GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.67 to $0.73. 
In summary, we expect growth in Q4 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by strength in Automotive and Industrial. We continue to execute to our updated financial model, resulting in stronger earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy."

It actually -- they actually, from a timing point of view, shifted even more revenue than we had expected from Q4 into Q3, and so now that's reflected in our guidance. And so if you look at the Q4 guidance, if you -- there's the issue on that -- kind of that shipment timing. If you take that out, you have our Industrial -- our Automotive business, which is up in the high teens year-over-year; you have our Industrial business, which is up in the mid-teens year-over-year; we have our cloud data center, which is in hyper-growth phase, right, off of small base, growing 40%, 50% year-over-year; and then you also have the Consumer business that we said basically flat year-over-year.

And that actually bodes really well for Maxim. And it also bodes well for 48-volt or higher voltage distribution of power. So what we're seeing is the direction the data center market is taking is in favor of 48-volt distribution but also goes into the sweet spot of Maxim solutions in terms of the end conversions. So these things take multiple years to actually turn into revenue, but the leading indicators are essentially telling us that the market dynamics are beneficial for us.

So that's a driver that makes them move faster than probably the rest of the world. But in other parts of the world as well, there's a large commitment to electric vehicles deployment by consumers. So I think it's a good opportunity story for us. We talked about -- in the prepared comments, I mentioned why our products are in high demand basically because they offer better safety or ASIL capabilities, and all of that is enabling us to get great design wins across everywhere.

But the pieces that are growing the fastest as a percentage are driver assist and BMS. But just to give you some numbers, I think that the infotainment section of the business is the dominant piece. It's about 2/3 of the business and 2/3 of -- there, and the other ones are divided off the small. So it's safety and security segment, which is ADAS, basically. It's maybe about 10%, and powertrain is maybe about 10% or so. It's in that range, to give you an idea. Those 2 10%-businesses are growing really fast. They're in hyper growth.

But again, we don't have a lot of unique insights into the comm infrastructure business, and we have a very broad-based sort of catalog-driven business. Obviously, on the optical side, we're in kind of hyper growth, and literally, there's nothing seasonal about that. That is just as people adopt 100G connectivity, optical connectivity, that business is growing very, very fast. And as we've said, sort of around off a small base, kind of this 50% year-on-year growth rate. And so that -- so Comm and Data Center isn't really seasonal.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. We're pleased with our June quarter results. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is producing sustainable and profitable growth. Our growing free cash flow enables us to announce a 10% increase in our dividend today, delivering long-term value to our shareholders. 
Let me next turn to this quarter's results. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly driven by Automotive, Industrial and Data Center with continued solid profitability. I would like to remind investors that June quarter last year included a transition of Digi-Key to accounting. During my market revenu commentary, I will exclude this factor. First, I will comment on Automotive. In the June quarter, our Automotive business was up 20% from the same quarter last year. We continued to see strong demand in Automotive power products for entertainment systems, management systems for electric vehicles and driver-assistance content. Our expertise in Automotive Safety Integrity Level's, also known as ASIL, is a key competitive advantage in our power and battery management products. As I mentioned last quarter, these safety levels address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction.
Maxim's battery management system and power management products for Automotive lead the industry in ASIL performance. In the quarter, we announced several new products to address the specific power management requirements for driver assistance applications, such as collision avoidance, navigation, adaptive cruise control, Lane centering, Lane departure warning and vision cameras. Power management comprises over half of Maxim's dollar content opportunities in driver-assistance applications. 
Turning to the September quarter. We expect Automotive to be flat sequentially, in line with seasonality and up in the high-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect strength from content growth and infotainment, battery management systems and driver assistance. 
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the June quarter, Industrial was strongly up 13% from the same quarter last year, after normalizing for accounting in last year's baseline. Our growth in Industrial was led by overall strong distribution resales in the broad market by factory automation content and in medical products. In our broad market business, we continued to grow resales through our distribution partners. In the quarter, we added a new distribution partner in Asia, as we extend our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the June quarter, distribution channel resales grew 17% from the same period last year. This is healthy double-digit growth from a strong 2017 June quarter. In factory automation, Maxim customers are enabling intelligence at the edge of the factory network. We're in the early days of the deployment of industry 4.0 control systems in factories around the world. And this movement has a few more decades before the market saturates. Maxim has content in controllers, sensors and an opportunity in robuts. As controllers and sensors become more complex, the engineering requirements grow, and our content opportunity grows as well. We estimate that Maxim's content opportunities in controllers can double and sensor content can grow by 50% with the implementation of a modern industry 4.0 factory architecture.
In Medical, we continued to see double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication and ultrasound products. Our authentication products ensure that genuine medical consumables are used with clinical equipment. We expect continued growth of this business over the coming quarters. In the September quarter, we expect Industrial to be down sequentially in line with seasonality and up in the mid-teens, again, compared to the same period last year. This performance is expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the June quarter, Comm and Data Center was up sequentially with strong growth in 100G optical products for the Data Center. In the September quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be flat sequentially, and up strongly from the same period last year. Our year-over-year growth is expected to be driven by deployments of 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity within Data Centers.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. Consumer was strongly down sequentially in the June quarter as expected and was modestly up from the same period a year ago. Diversification in tablets, variables, gaming and a broad set of consumer products enabled our growth from the same quarter last year. We continued to execute on a broad market strategy with small, medium business customers in the Consumer market. In the quarter, we announced few products that provide industry-leading accuracy in battery management for a range of applications, including handheld gaming systems, smartphone devices and USB Type-C affordable devices. Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and flat from the same quarter last year through diversification in tablets and gaming. Smartphones are expected to be flat sequentially.
To summarize, current business conditions are good and we built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we're growing in high-quality diversified markets such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows. Maxim priorities are to grow revenue, maximize profitability with continued financial stability and we are certainly delivering on all three. With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Bruce."

Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sound accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22%",745,"Thanks, Tunç. Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sound accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22% Automotive, 20% common Data Center and 4% computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business is comprised over 50% of our revenue in the quarter.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in the June quarter. We ended Q4 with 60 days of inventory in the distribution channel within our target range of 55 to 60 days. Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chain and our distributors performance given the uncertainties in the industry. 
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68%, up from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and a few one-time items. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $195 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $236 million. Operating margin at 37.2% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 140 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 17% from the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year, 2018 EPS grew 28% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $98 million in the fourth quarter to $2.63 billion. Q4 inventory days ended at 127, up 10 days from Q3. Inventory dollars were up 3% from the prior quarter.
Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $932 million or 38% of revenue, which is up 29% over the same quarter last year. Free cash flow excludes a onetime tax payment of $178 million related to a preliminary understanding with the IRF. Our free cash flow yield is 5.6% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.28, above our original target of $3 per share and well on our way to our current target of $3.50 per share.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q4, as we bought back approximately 2.2 million shares. Dividends totaled $117 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. As Tunç mentioned, our board has approved a 10% increase in the dividend, which will be paid in Q1 '19. Based on the increase in the dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is just over 3%. Our increase in the dividend plus share repurchases reflect our return of capital commitment of 100% of free cash flow. 
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q1 backlog was $441 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q1 revenue of $615 million to $655 million. Q1 revenue is expected to be up approximately 10% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year, driven by double-digit growth in Automotive and Industrial. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66.5% to 68.5%, down slightly due to the one-time items from the prior quarter. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the mid-190s, flat with Q4 despite the impact of our annual merit increase in September due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q1, excluding special items, is expected to be 9% to 10%, down from Q4 due to tax reform and the preliminary understanding with the IRS. For Q1, GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.72 to $0.78. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue, as we perform required maintenance and add capacity to our only remaining internal fab. 
In summary, we expect significant growth in Q1 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by growth in Automotive and Industrial. Our financial model is a hallmark of high-quality companies, delivering strong earnings and free cash flow growth, a 100% of which we are returning to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

Great job on the gross margin expansion and the move towards the upper end of your target of 70%. I think, you guys beat the June quarter guidance by 100 basis points, the midpoint. And it looks like your September quarter outlook shows the sustainability of those margins. I remember at our investor conference back in May, you guys articulated some near-term initiatives you're focused on to drive gross margins and namely that was improving the utilizations of your internal organ fab, which has a lower cost profile and moving more products into that fab. Is that what drove the margin expansion on part of the margin expansion? And maybe if you can just articulated some of the other initiatives both near-term and longer term?"

When we did talk about the tailwinds, one of them was the increased utilization of our remaining fab up in Organ. We also talked about flexible boundary capacity in our ability to move wafers around to kind of optimize cost on that. Of course, deposition will continue to come down towards CapEx. Depreciation was $23 million in the quarter and CapEx was like $12 million, $13 million. And then we also talked about growth in our SMB customer rates and sort of the growth in our kind of the change in mix of our business, and finally the improving pricing environment. So when we look at Q4, of those tailwinds, probably the most pronounced was this improvement in our Digi-Key business. It was over 51% of revenue, right? So that continues to grow. And we know that a high-margin business. In addition, Industrial was 30% of revenue. I didn't check it, but I think my time has been here, that's close to a high water mark for Industrial. So again -- so I think that strategy of going for high-quality businesses and going for SMB is also adding to that gross margin. So I think going forward, every quarter we were not going to have all of those tailwinds help. I think in this case it was SMB and the push into Industrial and Automotive. I think we will continue to see those tailwinds and help us continue to grow our gross margin overtime, including that a whole earliest. I will say that, for onetime items that helped us a little bit in Q4. And so that's why we guided Q1, the September quarter, down a little bit. We only guide in kind of 50 bps increments. And so kind of the midpoint of our guidance came out to about 67.5%. We'll probably do a little bit better than that. But it will be down. We are expecting to be down a little bit just because of some of those one-time items. But overall, I think, just the continued movement up of gross margin. And as we've always said, it won't happen and in some big chunk it's just going to be nice incremental tailwinds over multiple years to really drive to the upper end of that 67% to 70% range."

So what's really happened a couple of years back, we've decided that we have to broaden this business new customers in addition to the ones we had and find new applications where our products could go. Basically, we've been executing on their strategy. And as a result, we've had a lot of product areas where we can sell our parts outside of smartphones in addition to smartphones. These are products like gaming systems, they are variables, they are hearable, any talked a lot of those also in the past. So all of those other non-smartphone applications that we made products are basically paying dividends now. And as you saw, we were able to have, despite strong headwind because of the actually re-ramp from our major customer, year-over-year we did pretty well in that space. So in the long-term, we're going to continue to look for applications where we can have sustainable differentiation, and we can command what type of margins we can. And when we found those applications, we will invest in those. But in the long-term, one of your questions, what do you expect for growth? We're really not counting on much of a growth in the Consumer space. So I think, future growth is still going to be mostly coming from Automotive and Industrial, as you mentioned, with the Data Center -- the cloud Data Center being the third and very modest growth in Consumer."

We do look at the ordering patterns of our customers, and our ability to meet those orders. That's usually the first thing that triggers customers getting concerned and placing extra orders, let's say. So in Maxim's case, we're aware that there is a lot of shortages of other components. But in Maxim's case, our customer order lead times, the lead time at which they order from us, has really not changed appreciably. That's #1. #2 is, our ability to respond and deliver to their orders has not changed for us and has been in this 5 to 7-week range for 5 to 6 years. So we don't see any reason for them to change the way they order from the company. We also look at other indicators. We look at cancellations -- order cancellations and indicators. We look at pushouts of orders. That's another indicator. So when we look at all these, we're seeing things to be normal and we're happy to see the fact that the business conditions are good.

A lot of the business is showing up in our China accounts. But the recent wins have been in other regions as well, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we're shipping really to every geographical region. So it's pretty broad-based. The China EV demand can be lumpy, but the opportunity is real given that there are quality issue that we all hear about in China. We do expect the market is growing at least 2x faster than the rest of Automotive, which is good and healthy. We look at our numbers and the year-over-year basis we've almost doubled this business year-over-year. So conditions are very good.

So this is Bruce, I'll take that. I think, overall when we think about our return to capital policy, we returned about 100%. Our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.

Our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. When we think about the split between the 2, it really kind of starts with the dividend and we look at that as a -- on a free cash flow payout ratio. And we generally tried to target about 50% payout ratio on the dividend, and with the idea being that we always want to make sure that if there is some type of global cycle that no matter what happens to our business that dividend will be safe. I think the good news is and what gives us confidence is, not only is our business doing very well, but the company is structured to do very well in any type of environment. And so when we think about that obviously, we're growing in these high-quality diversified markets markets, Automotive, Industrial. Since the last recession, we shifted our manufacturing strategy, where back in 2008 I think we were like 85%, 90% in-house, now we're only 25% in-house. So we have a much better variable cost structure. Obviously, we continued to manage our spending tightly. CapEx is within a very narrow range of 1% to 3%. And so all of that drives these very strong cash flows and very consistent cash flows. And so because of that, management and the board is confident in increasing the dividend. I'd say the other thing is, normally we do it at this time frame. We did do an increase in January because that was because of tax reform and we got access to all of our International cash. So that further gave us -- so at that time we increased the dividends 17%, and now we're increasing another 10%. Again, based on the strength of the business, sort of the model we built, that we think can be successful in any environment and the availability of 100% of our cash. And so those are the factors that are really thinking or how we think of the dividend and overall return of capital."

And I think that, obviously, the other 2, you mentioned, BMS and ADAS, those products are in hyper growth, and they are from a smaller base. So that's more understandable. Actually I'm not aware of what everybody else is reporting for infotainment. But I mean, if you're saying we are growing faster, that's good, means our products are better. I don't really have a much better explanation. The thing that one reason that I can speculate about was our capabilities some of these products, which are important. And our revenue in infotainment comes mostly from power. And I'm not sure what the makeup is for these other companies that are reporting in infotainment. And I think, the power needs might be growing faster than other functions or other systems infotainment. So those are kind of speculative that we really don't have the exact data to support that. But that would be my estimation."

What do I mean by that? What I mean really is that there is increasing animal content in the basic functions in the factory like controllers and sensors, and to some extent in robotics. As intelligence moves to the edge of the factory, this was most of the presentation we gave a few months ago. And we see a lot of upgrades especially in China for their factories. And wherever precision manufacturing is needed around the world. So we have a lot of products that we designed, I would say, in the last 5, 6 years for doing better isolation products, lot of new generations of power management parts that have high voltage, which we didn't have before. And as a result of all that, we're seeing a lot of success with this freshened up product portfolio, and we're seeing that as the main driver of growth for us. So you mentioned there is something offsetting, and I'll be honest with you. I don't know what that is and we're not aware of it. But all I can say is that, I think this trend of improving their factories productivity is going to be around for a long time. And in our presentation, we showed data that say is going to be the case, especially for China and other parts of the world. So it really is a growth that's been driven by the fact that we've got these new fresh product lines that are extremely suitable for industry 4.0."

And then, I think, also as we shift to from kind of distribution and SMB markets, right, these are smaller customers, lower volumes and generally we have more pricing power with those -- with that customer set as well. So I do think overall, we've seen a favorable pricing environment, whether that's in some areas we've been, I would say kind of manage on the longtail, be able to increase pricing and maybe with some of our larger customers that's just the smaller elections from annual price negotiation. So it is definitely a tailwind, it's not something that is easily quantified, but it's something we clearly see when we kind of look at our business year-over-year, we are able to see our product margins at kind of a constant standard cost, either stable or slightly up, which is unusual in the past.

So I do think there is some continued room, and we're continuing  and as tx mentioned, we added a new distribution partner in Asia.

Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is producing sustainable and profitable growth.

Let me next turn to this quarter's results. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Industrial and Data Center with continued solid profitability. I would like to remind investors that June quarter last year included a transition of Digi-Key to sell-in accounting. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude this factor.
First, I will comment on Automotive. In the June quarter, our Automotive business was up 20% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong demand in Automotive power products, for entertainment systems, battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver-assistance content. Our expertise in Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or also known as ASIL, is a key competitive advantage in our power and battery management products. As I mentioned last quarter, these safety levels address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. Maxim's battery management system and power management products for Automotive lead the industry in ASIL performance. 
In the quarter, we announced several new products to address the specific power management requirements of driver assistance applications, such as collision avoidance, navigation, adaptive cruise control, lane centering, lane departure warning and vision cameras. Power management comprises over half of Maxim's dollar content opportunities in driver-assistance applications.
Turning to the September quarter. We expect Automotive to be flat sequentially, in line with seasonality and up in the high-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect strength from content growth in infotainment, battery management systems and driver assistance.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the June quarter, Industrial was strongly up 13% from the same quarter last year, after normalizing for sell-in accounting in last year's baseline. Our growth in Industrial was led by overall strong distribution resales in the broad market by factory automation content and in medical products. In our broad market business, we continue to grow resales through our distribution partners. In the quarter, we added a new distribution partner in Asia, as we extend our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the June quarter, distribution channel resales grew 17% from the same period last year. This is healthy double-digit growth from a strong 2017 June quarter.
In factory automation, Maxim customers are enabling intelligence at the edge of the factory network. We're in the early days of the deployment of Industry 4.0 control systems in factories around the world. And this movement has a few more decades before the market saturates. Maxim has content in controllers, sensors and a nascent opportunity in robots. As controllers and sensors become more complex, the engineering requirements grow, and our content opportunity grows as well. We estimate that Maxim's content opportunities in controllers can double and sensor content can grow by 50% with the implementation of a modern Industry 4.0 factory architecture.
In Medical, we continue to see double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication and ultrasound products. Our authentication products ensure that genuine medical consumables are used with clinical equipment. We expect continued growth of this business over the coming quarters. In the September quarter, we expect Industrial to be down sequentially in line with seasonality and up in the mid-teens, again, compared to the same period last year. This performance is expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the June quarter, Comms and Data Center was up sequentially with strong growth in 100G optical products for the Data Center. In the September quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be flat sequentially, and up strongly from the same period last year. Our year-over-year growth is expected to be driven by deployments of 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity within Data Centers.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. Consumer was strongly down sequentially in the June quarter as expected and was modestly up from the same period a year ago. Diversification in tablets, wearables, gaming and a broad set of consumer products enabled our growth from the same quarter last year. We continue to execute on a broad market strategy with small and medium business customers in the Consumer market. In the quarter, we announced fuel gauge products that provide industry-leading accuracy in battery management for a range of applications, including handheld gaming systems, smart home devices and USB Type-C portable devices. Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and flat from the same quarter last year through diversification in tablets and gaming. Smartphones are expected to be flat sequentially.
To summarize, current business conditions are good, and we've built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we're growing in high quality diversified markets such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows. Maxim priorities are to grow revenue, maximize profitability with continued financial stability, and we are certainly delivering on all three.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Bruce."

Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sell-in accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22",745,"Thanks, Tunç. Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sell-in accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22% Automotive, 20% Comm and Data Center and 4% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive businesses comprised over 50% of our revenue in the quarter.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in the June quarter. We ended Q4 with 60 days of inventory in the distribution channel, within our target range of 55 to 60 days. Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chain and our distributors performance given the uncertainties in the industry.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68%, up from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and a few onetime items. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $195 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $236 million. Operating margin at 37.2% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 140 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 17% from the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year, 2018 EPS grew 28% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $98 million in the fourth quarter to $2.63 billion. Q4 inventory days ended at 127, up 10 days from Q3. Inventory dollars were up 3% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $932 million or 38% of revenue, which is up 29% over the same quarter last year. Free cash flow excludes a onetime tax payment of $178 million related to a preliminary understanding with the IRS. Our free cash flow yield is 5.6% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.28, above our original target of $3.00 per share and well on our way to our current target of $3.50 per share.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q4, as we bought back approximately 2.2 million shares. Dividends totaled $117 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. As Tunç mentioned, our board has approved a 10% increase in the dividend, which will be paid in Q1 '19. Based on the increase in the dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is just over 3%. Our increase in the dividend plus share repurchases reflect our return of capital commitment of 100% of free cash flow.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q1 backlog was $441 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected terms, we forecast Q1 revenue of $615 million to $655 million. Q1 revenue is expected to be up approximately 10% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year, driven by double-digit growth in Automotive and Industrial. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66.5% to 68.5%, down slightly due to the onetime items in the prior quarter. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the mid-190s, flat with Q4 despite the impact of our annual merit increase in September due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q1, excluding special items, is expected to be 9% to 10%, down from Q4 due to tax reform and the preliminary understanding with the IRS. For Q1 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.72 to $0.78.
For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue, as we perform required maintenance and add capacity to our only remaining internal fab.
In summary, we expect significant growth in Q1 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by growth in Automotive and Industrial. Our financial model is a hallmark of high-quality companies, delivering strong earnings and free cash flow growth, a 100% of which we are returning to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

I remember at our investor conference back in May, you guys articulated some near-term initiatives you're focused on to drive gross margins and namely that was improving the utilizations of your internal Oregon fab, which has a lower cost profile and moving more products into that fab. Is that what drove the margin expansion or part of the margin expansion? And maybe if you can just articulate some of the other initiatives, both near term and longer term?"

When we did talk about the tailwinds, one of them was the increased utilization of our remaining fab up in Oregon. We also talked about flexible boundary capacity and our ability to move wafers around to kind of optimize cost on that. Of course, depreciation will continue to come down towards CapEx. Depreciation was $23 million in the quarter and CapEx was like $12 million, $13 million. And then we also talked about growth in our SMB customer rates and sort of the growth in our kind of the change in mix of our business, and finally the improving pricing environment. So when we look at Q4, of those tailwinds, probably the most pronounced was this improvement in our disti business. It was over 51% of revenue, right? So that continues to grow. And we know that's a high-margin business. In addition, Industrial was 30% of revenue. I didn't check it, but I think since my time has been here, that's close to a high watermark for Industrial. So again -- so I think that strategy of going for high-quality businesses and going for SMB is also adding to that gross margin. So I think going forward, every quarter you're not going to have all of those tailwinds help. I think in this case it was the SMB and the push into Industrial and Automotive. I think we'll continue to see those tailwinds help us continue to grow our gross margin over time, including that whole list. I will say that there were some -- a few onetime items that helped us a little bit in Q4. And so that's why we guided Q1, the September quarter, down a little bit. We only guide in kind of 50 bps increments. And so kind of the midpoint of our guidance came out to about 67.5%. We'll probably do a little bit better than that. But it will be down. We are expecting to be down a little bit just because of some of those onetime items. But overall, I think, just the continued movement up of gross margin. And as we've always said, it won't happen in some big chunk, it's just going to be nice incremental tailwinds over multiple years to really drive to the upper end of that 67% to 70% range."

These are products like gaming systems, that are wearables, that are hearable, I think we talked a lot about those also in the past. So all of those other non-smartphone applications that we made products for are basically paying dividends now. And as you saw, we were able to have, despite the strong headwind because of the early ramp from our major customer, year-over-year we did pretty well in that space. So in the long-term, we're going to continue to look for applications where we can have sustainable differentiation, and we can command the type of margins that we can. And when we find those applications, we will invest in those. But in the long-term, one of your questions, what do you expect for growth? We're really not counting on much of a growth in the Consumer space. So I think, future growth is still going to be mostly coming from Automotive and Industrial, as you mentioned, with the Data Center -- cloud data center being the third and very modest growth in Consumer."

We do look at the ordering patterns of our customers, and our ability to meet those orders. That's usually the first thing that triggers customers getting concerned and placing extra orders, let's say. So in Maxim's case, we're aware that there is a lot of shortages of other components. But in Maxim's case, our customer order lead times, the lead time at which they order from us, has really not changed appreciably. That's number one. Number two is, our ability to respond and deliver to their orders has not changed for us and has been in this 5 to 7-week range for 5 to 6 years. So we don't see any reason for them to change the way they order from the company. We also look at other indicators. We look at cancellations -- order cancellations as an indicator. We look at pushouts of orders, that's another indicator. So when we look at all these, we're seeing things to be normal, and we're happy to see the fact that the business conditions are good. And we're growing the broad base business for the company. So those comments that we made also last quarter, none of those have changed this quarter. So it looks the same way."

A lot of the business is showing up in our China accounts. But the recent wins have been in other regions as well, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we're shipping really to every geographical region. So it's pretty broad based. The China EV demand can be lumpy, but the opportunity is real given that there are quality issues that we all hear about in China. We do expect the market is growing at least 2x faster than the rest of Automotive, which is good and healthy. We look at our numbers on a year-over-year basis we've almost doubled this business year-over-year. So conditions are very good. And the reason it looks like we are winning these customers is that, same thing I talked about in my prepared remarks.

So this is Bruce, I'll take that. So I think, overall when we think about our return to capital policy, we returned about 100%. Our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.

Our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. When we think about the split between the 2, it really kind of starts with the dividend, and we look at that as a -- on a free cash flow payout ratio. And we generally try to target about 50% payout ratio on the dividend, and with the idea being that we always want to make sure that if there is some type of global cycle that no matter what happens to our business that dividend will be safe. I think the good news is and what gives us confidence is, not only is our business doing very well, but the company is structured to do very well in any type of environment. And so when we think about that obviously, we're growing in these kind of high quality diversified markets, Automotive and Industrial. Since the last recession, we've shifted our manufacturing strategy, where back in 2008 I think we were like 85%, 90% in-house, now we're only 25% in-house. So we have a much better variable cost structure. Obviously, we continue to manage our spending tightly. CapEx is within a very narrow range of 1% to 3%. And so all of that drives these very strong cash flows and very consistent cash flows. And so because of that, management and the board is confident in increasing the dividend. I'd say the other thing is, normally we do it at this time frame. We did do an increase in January because that was because of tax reform, and we got access to all of our international cash. So that further gave us -- so at that time we increased the dividends 17%, and then now we're increasing another 10%. Again, based on kind of the strength of the business, sort of the model we built, that we think can be successful in any environment and the availability of 100% of our cash. And so those are the factors that are really our thinking for how we think of the dividend and overall return of capital."

As we've said in earlier calls, our strength is mostly in the laser driver side, the Data Center 100G business. From a year-over-year basis, I think we continue to see growth in fiscal year '19 compared to '18. And the visibility right now is that far, obviously, we're working on the next-generation products. But I think for the next couple of years, maybe 3 years, most of it will be coming from 100G products. And we've got wins that spend multiple club customers. So I don't know comment was from which one. But I think when you see a 100G intra Data Center growth, we're most likely very involved in that design win or in that business."

Kathy a while back was kind enough to kind of help educate us a little bit on the factory automation sub bucket of Industrial. And we're all turning a little bit more intelligence on these sort of nontraditional supply chains. There has been, if you look, especially at some of the Japanese factory automation companies, some more mixed data points. I'm curious that that's something that you're seeing in the business? Is there content offset or is it just that other parts of Industrial are making up for kind of weaknesses? How do I think about kind of factory automation growth for you guys from here?"

What do I mean by that? What I mean really is that there is increasing analogue content in the basic functions in a factory like controllers and sensors, and to some extent in robotics. As intelligence moves to the edge of the factory, this was most of the presentation we gave a few months ago. And we see a lot of upgrades especially in China for their factories and wherever precision manufacturing is needed around the world. So we have a lot of products that we designed, I would say, in the last 5, 6 years for doing IO-Link's better isolation products, lot of new generations of power management parts that are high voltage, which we didn't have before. And as a result of all that, we're seeing a lot of success with this freshened up product portfolio, and we're seeing that as the main driver of growth for us. So you mentioned there is something offsetting, I'll be honest with you. I don't know what that is, and we're not aware of it at Maxim. But all I can say is that, I think this trend of improving the factory's productivity is going to be around for a long time. And in our presentation, we showed data that say that it's going to be the case, especially for China and other parts of the world. So it really is a growth that's been driven by the fact that we've got these new fresh product lines that are extremely suitable for Industry 4.0."

I think that was a response to Harlan's question around long-term tailwinds for gross margin. And absolutely, on a long-term basis, we think in an environment of consolidation, right, it does give some pricing power back to the chip companies, whether that's in with our customers in BPA negotiations, whether that's in kind of the negotiations with distributors. And then, I think, also as we shift to the kind of distribution in SMB markets, right, these are smaller customers, lower volumes and generally we have more pricing power with those -- with that customer set as well. So I do think overall, we've seen a favorable pricing environment, whether that's in some areas we've been, I would say, kind of manage on the long tail, be able to increase pricing and maybe with some of our larger customers that's just smaller elections from a -- kind of in the annual price negotiation. So it is definitely a tailwind, it's not something that is easily quantified, but it's something we clearly see when we kind of look at our business year-over-year, we're able to see our product margins at kind of a constant standard cost, either stable or slightly up, which is unusual in the past.

I hope I was clear that it's -- we're not having shortages at Maxim, and we haven't had for a long time. I think, our supply chain is right now a lot more robust and flexible than before. So there are shortages from what I read of passive components, like capacitors and resistors, and there is still some tightness in discrete components, like FETs and diodes, areas where you wouldn't think there would be shortages because they are the easier products produce, frankly, than a complicated chip. But those are the ones that we've heard. Frankly, in our internal reviews, we're not hearing that that's limiting us from selling our products. Obviously, a customer needs all of the BOM to be able to build something. But it's -- I've heard very few cases where somebody said they wanted to delay shipments to Maxim products because they couldn't get something else, either they are not bubbling to me or the they are not severe enough for us to deal with.

So I do think there is some continued room, and we're continuing, as Tunç mentioned, we added a new distribution partner in Asia. We continue to look for new partners around kind of the catalog-type suppliers and really selling into those really small accounts.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
We're pleased with our June quarter results. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is producing sustainable and profitable growth. Our growing free cash flow enables us to announce a 10% increase in our dividend today, delivering long-term value to our shareholders.
Let me next turn to this quarter's results. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Industrial and Data Center with continued solid profitability. I would like to remind investors that June quarter last year included the transition of Digi-Key to sell-in accounting. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude this factor.
First, I will comment on Automotive. In the June quarter, our Automotive business was up 20% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong demand in Automotive power products, for infotainment systems, battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver-assistance content. Our expertise in Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or also known as ASIL, is a key competitive advantage in our power and battery management products. As I mentioned last quarter, these safety levels address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. Maxim's battery management system and power management products for Automotive lead the industry in ASIL performance. 
In the quarter, we announced several new products to address the specific power management requirements of driver assistance applications, such as collision avoidance, navigation, adaptive cruise control, lane centering, lane departure warning and vision cameras. Power management comprises over half of Maxim's dollar content opportunities in driver-assistance applications.
Turning to the September quarter. We expect Automotive to be flat sequentially, in line with seasonality and up in the high-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect strength from content growth in infotainment, battery management systems and driver assistance.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the June quarter, Industrial was strongly up 13% from the same quarter last year, after normalizing for sell-in accounting in last year's baseline. Our growth in Industrial was led by overall strong distribution resales in the broad market by factory automation content and in medical products. In our broad market business, we continued to grow resales through our distribution partners. In the quarter, we added a new distribution partner in Asia, as we extend our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the June quarter, distribution channel resales grew 17% from the same period last year. This is healthy double-digit growth from a strong 2017 June quarter.
In factory automation, Maxim customers are enabling intelligence at the edge of the factory network. We're in the early days of the deployment of Industry 4.0 control systems in factories around the world. And this movement has a few more decades before the market saturates. Maxim has content in controllers, sensors and a nascent opportunity in robots. As controllers and sensors become more complex, the engineering requirements grow, and our content opportunity grows as well. We estimate that Maxim's content opportunities in controllers can double and sensor content can grow by 50% with the implementation of a modern Industry 4.0 factory architecture.
In Medical, we continue to see double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication and ultrasound products. Our authentication products ensure that genuine medical consumables are used with clinical equipment. We expect continued growth of this business over the coming quarters. In the September quarter, we expect Industrial to be down sequentially in line with seasonality and up in the mid-teens, again, compared to the same period last year. This performance is expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the June quarter, Comms and Data Center was up sequentially with strong growth in 100G optical products for the Data Center. In the September quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be flat sequentially, and up strongly from the same period last year. Our year-over-year growth is expected to be driven by deployments of 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity within Data Centers.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. Consumer was strongly down sequentially in the June quarter as expected and was modestly up from the same period a year ago. Diversification in tablets, wearables, gaming and a broad set of consumer products enabled our growth from the same quarter last year. We continued to execute on a broad market strategy with small, medium business customers in the Consumer market. In the quarter, we announced fuel gauge products that provide industry-leading accuracy in battery management for a range of applications, including handheld gaming systems, smart home devices and USB Type-C portable devices.
Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and flat from the same quarter last year through diversification in tablets and gaming. Smartphones are expected to be flat sequentially.
To summarize, current business conditions are good, and we've built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we're growing in high quality diversified markets such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows. Maxim priorities are to grow revenue, maximize profitability with continued financial stability, and we are certainly delivering on all 3..
With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Bruce."

Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sell-in accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22",744,"Thanks, Tunç. Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sell-in accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22% Automotive, 20% Comm and Data Center and 4% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive businesses comprised over 50% of our revenue in the quarter.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in the June quarter. We ended Q4 with 60 days of inventory in the distribution channel, within our target range of 55 to 60 days. Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chain and our distributors performance given the uncertainties in the industry.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68%, up from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and a few onetime items. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $195 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $236 million. Operating margin at 37.2% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 140 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 17% from the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year, 2018 EPS grew 28% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $98 million in the fourth quarter to $2.63 billion. Q4 inventory days ended at 127, up 10 days from Q3. Inventory dollars were up 3% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $932 million or 38% of revenue, which is up 29% over the same quarter last year. Free cash flow excludes a onetime tax payment of $178 million related to a preliminary understanding with the IRS. Our free cash flow yield is 5.6% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.28, above our original target of $3.00 per share and well on our way to our current target of $3.50 per share.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q4, as we bought back approximately 2.2 million shares. Dividends totaled $117 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. As Tunç mentioned, our board has approved a 10% increase in the dividend, which will be paid in Q1 '19. Based on the increase in the dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is just over 3%. Our increase in the dividend plus share repurchases reflect our return of capital commitment of 100% of free cash flow.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q1 backlog was $441 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected terms, we forecast Q1 revenue of $615 million to $655 million. Q1 revenue is expected to be up approximately 10% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year, driven by double-digit growth in Automotive and Industrial. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66.5% to 68.5%, down slightly due to the onetime items in the prior quarter. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the mid-190s, flat with Q4 despite the impact of our annual merit increase in September due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q1, excluding special items, is expected to be 9% to 10%, down from Q4 due to tax reform and the preliminary understanding with the IRS. For Q1 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.72 to $0.78.
For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue, as we perform required maintenance and add capacity to our only remaining internal fab.
In summary, we expect significant growth in Q1 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by growth in Automotive and Industrial. Our financial model is a hallmark of high-quality companies, delivering strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

I remember at our investor conference back in May, you guys articulated some near-term initiatives you were focused on to drive gross margins and namely that was improving the utilizations of your internal Oregon fab, which has a lower cost profile and moving more products into that fab. Is that what drove the margin expansion or part of the margin expansion? And maybe if you can just articulate some of the other initiatives, both near term and longer term?"

When we did talk about the tailwinds, one of them was the increased utilization of our remaining fab up in Oregon. We also talked about flexible foundry capacity and our ability to move wafers around to kind of optimize cost on that. Of course, depreciation will continue to come down towards CapEx. Depreciation was $23 million in the quarter and CapEx was like $12 million, $13 million. And then we also talked about growth in our SMB customer rates and sort of the growth in our kind of the change in mix of our business, and finally the improving pricing environment. So when we look at Q4, of those tailwinds, probably the most pronounced was this improvement in our disti business. It was over 51% of revenue, right? So that continues to grow. And we know that's a high-margin business. In addition, Industrial was 30% of revenue. I didn't check it, but I think since my time has been here, that's close to a high watermark for Industrial. So again -- so I think that strategy of going for high-quality businesses and going for SMB is also adding to that gross margin. So I think going forward, every quarter you're not going to have all of those tailwinds help. I think in this case it was the SMB and the push into Industrial and Automotive. I think we'll continue to see those tailwinds help us continue to grow our gross margin over time, including that whole list. I will say that there were some -- a few onetime items that helped us a little bit in Q4. And so that's why we guided Q1, the September quarter, down a little bit. We only guide in kind of 50 bps increments. And so kind of the midpoint of our guidance came out to about 67.5%. We'll probably do a little bit better than that. But it will be down. We are expecting to be down a little bit just because of some of those onetime items. But overall, I think, just the continued movement up of gross margin. And as we've always said, it won't happen in some big chunk, it's just going to be nice incremental tailwinds over multiple years to really drive to the upper end of that 67% to 70% range."

And basically, we've been executing on that strategy. And as a result, we've had a lot of product areas where we can sell our parts outside of smartphones in addition to smartphones. These are products like gaming systems, they're wearables, they're hearable, I think we talked a lot about those also in the past. So all of those other non-smartphone applications we've made products for are basically paying dividends now. And as you saw, we were able to have, despite the strong headwind because of the early ramp from our major customer, year-over-year we did pretty well in that space. So in the long-term, we're going to continue to look for applications where we can have sustainable differentiation, and we can command the type of margins that we can. And when we find those applications, we will invest in those. But in the long-term, one of your questions, what do you expect for growth? We're really not counting on much of a growth in the Consumer space. So I think, future growth is still going to be mostly coming from Automotive and Industrial, as you mentioned, with the Data Center -- cloud data center being the third and very modest growth in Consumer."

We do look at the ordering patterns of our customers, and our ability to meet those orders. That's usually the first thing that triggers customers getting concerned and placing extra orders, let's say. So in Maxim's case, we're aware that there is a lot of shortages of other components. But in Maxim's case, our customer order lead times, the lead time at which they order from us, has really not changed appreciably. That's number one. Number two is, our ability to respond and deliver to their orders has not changed for us and has been in this 5 to 7-week range for 5 to 6 years. So we don't see any reason for them to change the way they order from the company. We also look at other indicators. We look at cancellations -- order cancellations is an indicator. We look at pushouts of orders, that's another indicator. So when we look at all these, we're seeing things to be normal, and we're happy to see the fact that the business conditions are good. And we're growing the broad base business for the company. So those comments that we made also last quarter, none of those have changed this quarter. So it looks the same way."

A lot of the business is showing up in our China accounts. But the recent wins have been in other regions as well, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we're shipping really to every geographical region. So it's pretty broad based. The China EV demand can be lumpy, but the opportunity is real given that there are quality issues that we all hear about in China. We do expect the market is growing at least 2x faster than the rest of Automotive, which is good and healthy. We look at our numbers on a year-over-year basis we've almost doubled this business year-over-year. So conditions are very good. And the reason it looks like we are winning in these customers is that, same thing I talked about in my prepared remarks.

So this is Bruce, I'll take that. So I think, overall when we think about our return of capital policy, we return about 100%.

So I think, overall when we think about our return of capital policy, we return about 100%. Not about -- we -- our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. When we think about the split between the 2, it really kind of starts with the dividend, and we look at that as a -- on a free cash flow payout ratio. And we generally try to target about 50% payout ratio on the dividend, and with the idea being that we always want to make sure that if there is some type of global cycle that no matter what happens to our business that dividend will be safe. I think the good news is and what gives us confidence is, not only is our business doing very well, but the company is structured to do very well in any type of environment. And so when we think about that obviously, we're growing in these kind of high quality diversified markets, Automotive and Industrial. Since the last recession, we've shifted our manufacturing strategy, where back in 2008 I think we were like 85%, 90% in-house, now we're only 25% in-house. So we have a much better variable cost structure. Obviously, we continue to manage our spending tightly. CapEx is within a very narrow range of 1% to 3%. And so all of that drives these very strong cash flows and very consistent cash flows. And so because of that, management and the board is confident in increasing the dividend. I'd say the other thing is, normally we do it at this time frame. We did do an increase in January because that was because of tax reform, and we got access to all of our international cash. So that further gave us -- so at that time, we increased the dividend 17%, and then now we're increasing it another 10%. Again, based on kind of the strength of the business, sort of the model we built, that we think can be successful in any environment and the availability of 100% of our cash. And so those are the factors that are really our thinking for how we think of the dividend and overall return of capital."

But from a -- from understanding what the opportunities are as a result of tax reform, we're able to manage the business such that we're comfortable with this 9% to 10% number for FY '19. And it's obviously something we continue to study and to work on in order to minimize that number."

Kathy a while back was kind enough to kind of help educate us a little bit on the factory automation sub bucket of Industrial. And we're all trying to get a little bit more intelligence on these sort of nontraditional supply chains. There has been, if you look, especially at some of the Japanese factory automation companies, some more mixed data points. I'm curious if that that's something that you're seeing in the business. Is there content offset or is it just that other parts of Industrial are making up for kind of weaknesses? How do I think about kind of factory automation growth for you guys from here?"

What do I mean by that? What I mean really is that there is increasing analog content in the basic functions in a factory like controllers and sensors, and to some extent in robotics. As intelligence moves to the edge of the factory, this was most of the presentation we gave a few months ago. And we see a lot of upgrades especially in China for their factories and wherever precision manufacturing is needed around the world. So we have a lot of products that we designed, I would say, in the last 5, 6 years for doing IO-Link's better isolation products, lot of new generations of power management parts that are high voltage, which we didn't have before. And as a result of all that, we're seeing a lot of success with this freshened up product portfolio, and we're seeing that as the main driver of growth for us. So you mentioned there is something offsetting, I'll be honest with you. I don't know what that is, and we're not aware of it at Maxim. But all I can say is that, I think this trend of improving the factory's productivity is going to be around for a long time. And in our presentation, we showed data that say that it's going to be the case, especially for China and other parts of the world. So it really is a growth that's being driven by the fact that we've got these new fresh product lines that are extremely suitable for Industry 4.0."

I think that was a response to Harlan's question around long-term tailwinds for gross margin. And absolutely, on a long-term basis, we think in an environment of consolidation, right, it does give some pricing power back to the chip companies, whether that's in with our customers in BPA negotiations, whether that's in kind of the negotiations with distributors. And then, I think, also as we shift to the kind of distribution in SMB markets, right, these are smaller customers, lower volumes and generally we have more pricing power with those -- with that customer set as well. So I do think overall, we've seen a favorable pricing environment, whether that's in some areas we've been, I would say, kind of manage on the long tail, be able to increase pricing and maybe with some of our larger customers that's just smaller reductions from a -- kind of in the annual price negotiation. So it is definitely a tailwind, it's not something that is easily quantified, but it's something we clearly see when we kind of look at our business year-over-year, we're able to see our product margins at kind of a constant standard cost, either stable or slightly up, which is unusual in the past.

I hope I was clear that it's -- we're not having shortages at Maxim, and we haven't had for a long time. I think, our supply chain is right now a lot more robust and flexible than before.

But those are the ones that we've heard. Frankly, in our internal reviews, we're not hearing that that's limiting us from selling our products. Obviously, a customer needs all of the BOM to be able to build something. But it's -- I've heard very few cases where somebody said they wanted to delay shipments in Maxim products because they couldn't get something else, either they are not bubbling to me or the they are not severe enough for us to deal with.

So I do think there is some continued room, and we're continuing, as Tunç mentioned, we added a new distribution partner in Asia. We continue to look for new partners around kind of the catalog-type suppliers and really selling into those really small accounts.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
We're pleased with our June quarter results. Our power management franchise in Automotive and Industrial is producing sustainable and profitable growth. Our growing free cash flow enables us to announce a 10% increase in our dividend today, delivering long-term value to our shareholders.
Let me next turn to this quarter's results. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Industrial and Data Center with continued solid profitability. I would like to remind investors that June quarter last year included the transition of Digi-Key to sell-in accounting. During my market revenue commentary, I will exclude this factor.
First, I will comment on Automotive. In the June quarter, our Automotive business was up 20% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong demand in Automotive power products, for infotainment systems, battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver-assistance content. Our expertise in Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or also known as ASIL, is a key competitive advantage in our power and battery management products. As I mentioned last quarter, these safety levels address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. Maxim's battery management system and power management products for Automotive lead the industry in ASIL performance. 
In the quarter, we announced several new products to address the specific power management requirements of driver assistance applications, such as collision avoidance, navigation, adaptive cruise control, lane centering, lane departure warning and vision cameras. Power management comprises over half of Maxim's dollar content opportunities in driver-assistance applications.
Turning to the September quarter. We expect Automotive to be flat sequentially, in line with seasonality and up in the high-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect strength from content growth in infotainment, battery management systems and driver assistance.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the June quarter, Industrial was strongly up 13% from the same quarter last year, after normalizing for sell-in accounting in last year's baseline. Our growth in Industrial was led by overall strong distribution resales in the broad market by factory automation content and in medical products. In our broad market business, we continued to grow resales through our distribution partners. In the quarter, we added a new distribution partner in Asia, as we extend our global customer reach, particularly to small and medium business customers. In the June quarter, distribution channel resales grew 17% from the same period last year. This is healthy double-digit growth from a strong 2017 June quarter.
In factory automation, Maxim customers are enabling intelligence at the edge of the factory network. We're in the early days of the deployment of Industry 4.0 control systems in factories around the world. And this movement has a few more decades before the market saturates. Maxim has content in controllers, sensors and a nascent opportunity in robots. As controllers and sensors become more complex, the engineering requirements grow, and our content opportunity grows as well. We estimate that Maxim's content opportunities in controllers can double and sensor content can grow by 50% with the implementation of a modern Industry 4.0 factory architecture.
In Medical, we continue to see double-digit year-over-year growth from a small revenue base in authentication and ultrasound products. Our authentication products ensure that genuine medical consumables are used with clinical equipment. We expect continued growth of this business over the coming quarters. In the September quarter, we expect Industrial to be down sequentially in line with seasonality and up in the mid-teens, again, compared to the same period last year. This performance is expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the June quarter, Comms and Data Center was up sequentially with strong growth in 100G optical products for the Data Center. In the September quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be flat sequentially, and up strongly from the same period last year. Our year-over-year growth is expected to be driven by deployments of 100G optical products for high-speed rack-to-rack connectivity within Data Centers.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. Consumer was strongly down sequentially in the June quarter as expected and was modestly up from the same period a year ago. Diversification in tablets, wearables, gaming and a broad set of consumer products enabled our growth from the same quarter last year. We continued to execute on a broad market strategy with small, medium business customers in the Consumer market. In the quarter, we announced fuel gauge products that provide industry-leading accuracy in battery management for a range of applications, including handheld gaming systems, smart home devices and USB Type-C portable devices.
Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly up sequentially and flat from the same quarter last year through diversification in tablets and gaming. Smartphones are expected to be flat sequentially.
To summarize, current business conditions are good, and we've built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we're growing in high quality diversified markets such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows. Maxim priorities are to grow revenue, maximize profitability with continued financial stability, and we are certainly delivering on all 3..
With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Bruce."

Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22",744,"Thanks, Tunç. Revenue for Q4 was $633 million, up 5% from the same quarter a year ago or up 9% after adjusting for the sell-in accounting transition in Q4 '17. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 30% from Industrial, 24% Consumer, 22% Automotive, 20% Comm and Data Center and 4% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive businesses comprised over 50% of our revenue in the quarter.
Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in the June quarter. We ended Q4 with 60 days of inventory in the distribution channel, within our target range of 55 to 60 days. Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chain and our distributors performance given the uncertainties in the industry.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68%, up from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and a few onetime items. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $195 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $236 million. Operating margin at 37.2% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 140 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.73, up 17% from the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year, 2018 EPS grew 28% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $98 million in the fourth quarter to $2.63 billion. Q4 inventory days ended at 127, up 10 days from Q3. Inventory dollars were up 3% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $932 million or 38% of revenue, which is up 29% over the same quarter last year. Free cash flow excludes a onetime tax payment of $178 million related to a preliminary understanding with the IRS. Our free cash flow yield is 5.6% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.28, above our original target of $3.00 per share and well on our way to our current target of $3.50 per share.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $128 million in Q4, as we bought back approximately 2.2 million shares. Dividends totaled $117 million in the quarter or $0.42 per share. As Tunç mentioned, our board has approved a 10% increase in the dividend, which will be paid in Q1 '19. Based on the increase in the dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is just over 3%. Our increase in the dividend plus share repurchases reflect our return of capital commitment of 100% of free cash flow.
Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q1 backlog was $441 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected terms, we forecast Q1 revenue of $615 million to $655 million. Q1 revenue is expected to be up approximately 10% at the midpoint of our guidance compared to the same quarter last year, driven by double-digit growth in Automotive and Industrial. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66.5% to 68.5%, down slightly due to the onetime items in the prior quarter. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the mid-190s, flat with Q4 despite the impact of our annual merit increase in September due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q1, excluding special items, is expected to be 9% to 10%, down from Q4 due to tax reform and the preliminary understanding with the IRS. For Q1 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.72 to $0.78.
For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue, as we perform required maintenance and add capacity to our only remaining internal fab.
In summary, we expect significant growth in Q1 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, led by growth in Automotive and Industrial. Our financial model is a hallmark of high-quality companies, delivering strong earnings and free cash flow growth, 100% of which we are returning to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

I remember at our investor conference back in May, you guys articulated some near-term initiatives you were focused on to drive gross margins and namely that was improving the utilizations of your internal Oregon fab, which has a lower cost profile and moving more products into that fab. Is that what drove the margin expansion or part of the margin expansion? And maybe if you can just articulate some of the other initiatives, both near term and longer term?"

When we did talk about the tailwinds, one of them was the increased utilization of our remaining fab up in Oregon. We also talked about flexible foundry capacity and our ability to move wafers around to kind of optimize cost on that. Of course, depreciation will continue to come down towards CapEx. Depreciation was $23 million in the quarter and CapEx was like $12 million, $13 million. And then we also talked about growth in our SMB customer rates and sort of the growth in our kind of the change in mix of our business, and finally the improving pricing environment. So when we look at Q4, of those tailwinds, probably the most pronounced was this improvement in our disti business. It was over 51% of revenue, right? So that continues to grow. And we know that's a high-margin business. In addition, Industrial was 30% of revenue. I didn't check it, but I think since my time has been here, that's close to a high watermark for Industrial. So again -- so I think that strategy of going for high-quality businesses and going for SMB is also adding to that gross margin. So I think going forward, every quarter you're not going to have all of those tailwinds help. I think in this case it was the SMB and the push into Industrial and Automotive. I think we'll continue to see those tailwinds help us continue to grow our gross margin over time, including that whole list. I will say that there were some -- a few onetime items that helped us a little bit in Q4. And so that's why we guided Q1, the September quarter, down a little bit. We only guide in kind of 50 bps increments. And so kind of the midpoint of our guidance came out to about 67.5%. We'll probably do a little bit better than that. But it will be down. We are expecting to be down a little bit just because of some of those onetime items. But overall, I think, just the continued movement up of gross margin. And as we've always said, it won't happen in some big chunk, it's just going to be nice incremental tailwinds over multiple years to really drive to the upper end of that 67% to 70% range."

So what's really happened a couple of years back, we really decided that we had to broaden this business to find new customers in addition to the ones we had and to find new applications where our products could go. And basically, we've been executing on that strategy. And as a result, we've had a lot of product areas where we can sell our parts outside of smartphones in addition to smartphones. These are products like gaming systems, they're wearables, they're hearable, I think we talked a lot about those also in the past. So all of those other non-smartphone applications we've made products for are basically paying dividends now. And as you saw, we were able to have, despite the strong headwind because of the early ramp from our major customer, year-over-year we did pretty well in that space. So in the long-term, we're going to continue to look for applications where we can have sustainable differentiation, and we can command the type of margins that we can. And when we find those applications, we will invest in those. But in the long-term, one of your questions, what do you expect for growth? We're really not counting on much of a growth in the Consumer space. So I think, future growth is still going to be mostly coming from Automotive and Industrial, as you mentioned, with the Data Center -- cloud data center being the third and very modest growth in Consumer."

We do look at the ordering patterns of our customers, and our ability to meet those orders. That's usually the first thing that triggers customers getting concerned and placing extra orders, let's say. So in Maxim's case, we're aware that there is a lot of shortages of other components. But in Maxim's case, our customer order lead times, the lead time at which they order from us, has really not changed appreciably. That's number one. Number two is, our ability to respond and deliver to their orders has not changed for us and has been in this 5 to 7-week range for 5 to 6 years. So we don't see any reason for them to change the way they order from the company. We also look at other indicators. We look at cancellations -- order cancellations is an indicator. We look at pushouts of orders, that's another indicator. So when we look at all these, we're seeing things to be normal, and we're happy to see the fact that the business conditions are good. And we're growing the broad base business for the company. So those comments that we made also last quarter, none of those have changed this quarter. So it looks the same way."

A lot of the business is showing up in our China accounts. But the recent wins have been in other regions as well, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we're shipping really to every geographical region. So it's pretty broad based. The China EV demand can be lumpy, but the opportunity is real given that there are quality issues that we all hear about in China. We do expect the market is growing at least 2x faster than the rest of Automotive, which is good and healthy. We look at our numbers on a year-over-year basis we've almost doubled this business year-over-year. So conditions are very good. And the reason it looks like we are winning in these customers is that, same thing I talked about in my prepared remarks.

So this is Bruce, I'll take that. So I think, overall when we think about our return of capital policy, we return about 100%.

So I think, overall when we think about our return of capital policy, we return about 100%. Not about -- we -- our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. When we think about the split between the 2, it really kind of starts with the dividend, and we look at that as a -- on a free cash flow payout ratio. And we generally try to target about 50% payout ratio on the dividend, and with the idea being that we always want to make sure that if there is some type of global cycle that no matter what happens to our business that dividend will be safe. I think the good news is and what gives us confidence is, not only is our business doing very well, but the company is structured to do very well in any type of environment. And so when we think about that obviously, we're growing in these kind of high quality diversified markets, Automotive and Industrial. Since the last recession, we've shifted our manufacturing strategy, where back in 2008 I think we were like 85%, 90% in-house, now we're only 25% in-house. So we have a much better variable cost structure. Obviously, we continue to manage our spending tightly. CapEx is within a very narrow range of 1% to 3%. And so all of that drives these very strong cash flows and very consistent cash flows. And so because of that, management and the board is confident in increasing the dividend. I'd say the other thing is, normally we do it at this time frame. We did do an increase in January because that was because of tax reform, and we got access to all of our international cash. So that further gave us -- so at that time, we increased the dividend 17%, and then now we're increasing it another 10%. Again, based on kind of the strength of the business, sort of the model we built, that we think can be successful in any environment and the availability of 100% of our cash. And so those are the factors that are really our thinking for how we think of the dividend and overall return of capital."

Is there content offset or is it just that other parts of Industrial are making up for kind of weaknesses? How do I think about kind of factory automation growth for you guys from here?"

What do I mean by that? What I mean really is that there is increasing analog content in the basic functions in a factory like controllers and sensors, and to some extent in robotics. As intelligence moves to the edge of the factory, this was most of the presentation we gave a few months ago. And we see a lot of upgrades especially in China for their factories and wherever precision manufacturing is needed around the world. So we have a lot of products that we designed, I would say, in the last 5, 6 years for doing IO-Link's better isolation products, lot of new generations of power management parts that are high voltage, which we didn't have before. And as a result of all that, we're seeing a lot of success with this freshened up product portfolio, and we're seeing that as the main driver of growth for us. So you mentioned there is something offsetting, I'll be honest with you. I don't know what that is, and we're not aware of it at Maxim. But all I can say is that, I think this trend of improving the factory's productivity is going to be around for a long time. And in our presentation, we showed data that say that it's going to be the case, especially for China and other parts of the world. So it really is a growth that's being driven by the fact that we've got these new fresh product lines that are extremely suitable for Industry 4.0."

I think that was a response to Harlan's question around long-term tailwinds for gross margin. And absolutely, on a long-term basis, we think in an environment of consolidation, right, it does give some pricing power back to the chip companies, whether that's in with our customers in BPA negotiations, whether that's in kind of the negotiations with distributors. And then, I think, also as we shift to the kind of distribution in SMB markets, right, these are smaller customers, lower volumes and generally we have more pricing power with those -- with that customer set as well. So I do think overall, we've seen a favorable pricing environment, whether that's in some areas we've been, I would say, kind of manage on the long tail, be able to increase pricing and maybe with some of our larger customers that's just smaller reductions from a -- kind of in the annual price negotiation. So it is definitely a tailwind, it's not something that is easily quantified, but it's something we clearly see when we kind of look at our business year-over-year, we're able to see our product margins at kind of a constant standard cost, either stable or slightly up, which is unusual in the past. Again, those would normally come down over time."

I hope I was clear that it's -- we're not having shortages at Maxim, and we haven't had for a long time. I think, our supply chain is right now a lot more robust and flexible than before. So there are shortages from what I've read of passive components, like capacitors and resistors, and there is still some tightness in discrete components, like FETs and diodes, areas where you wouldn't think there would be shortages because they are the easier products produce, frankly, than a complicated chip. But those are the ones that we've heard. Frankly, in our internal reviews, we're not hearing that that's limiting us from selling our products. Obviously, a customer needs all of the BOM to be able to build something. But it's -- I've heard very few cases where somebody said they wanted to delay shipments in Maxim products because they couldn't get something else, either they are not bubbling to me or the they are not severe enough for us to deal with.

So we push on both channels. When we do look at some of our peers, they -- if we look at their kind of distribution business, it can get up to 60% of revenue. So I do think there is some continued room, and we're continuing, as Tunç mentioned, we added a new distribution partner in Asia. We continue to look for new partners around kind of the catalog-type suppliers and really selling into those really small accounts. We're also spending a lot of effort and one of the key initiatives for the company is really around digital marketing and how do we sell kind of an unassisted design win and whether that's just having better collateral on our website as far as application nodes or simulation models, all of the items that allow someone to find our part, pick our part, design it in with limited or no support. Of course, there's still going to be a very important role for our sales and application engineers to go help those customers. But the more we can help them, get started on a process, the better.

So that profile has gotten a little bit better because of our exposure being not as much as it used to be to our largest customer. But I'd still say that, projecting growth or projecting revenue in Consumer 1 or 2 years out is still difficult compared to some of the other markets where design wins are pretty well known, the production ramps are pretty well known, like Automotive.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
Our September quarter results were solid compared to the same quarter last year, revenue and profitability grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Consumer, Industrial and Data Center. Looking forward, we are seeing softening business conditions. However, we believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment. 
Due to our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance, we plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year by increasing the share buyback.
We believe buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter, last year was a 14-week quarter and was also impacted by the transition to sell in accounting at 1 distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparison's adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items.
Let me now discuss September results and current quarter outlook, starting with Automotive.
In the September quarter, our Automotive business was up 15% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see the strongest demand signals, battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistant content. Our content growth opportunities for Maxim and ADAS applications continue to be centered on power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. 
Recently, we introduced a new generation of serial link products for transporting video, audio and data in Automotive applications.
This GMSL-2 technology supports 6 gigabit per second transfers for display and driver assistance and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet. 
Our technology includes diagnostic capability to assist the health of the link and is compliant with automotive safety, integrity level standards, making it suitable for autonomous drive applications.
The first pair of products lead many GMSL-2 products to follow in the coming years. We received extremely strong customer pool for this product family. 
Customers have ordered over 90,000 entering prototypes in the first 3 months, and we had already 1 designs at 7 different OEMs.
Turning to battery management systems for electric vehicles. We are growing our global footprint as the design wins from prior years translate into today's revenue growth. 
Battery management systems and driver assistance revenue grew over 60% from the same quarter last year. In the December quarter, we expect Automotive to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect the strength to come from content increases and secular growth areas, offsetting slowdown in global auto production. We expect battery management systems revenue for electric vehicles to nearly double from the same quarter last year with growth across several geographies.
In addition, we expect continued content growth in driver assistance applications.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the September quarter, Industrial was up 12% from the same quarter last year. Our growth in Industrial benefited from content growth and factory automation and medical products. 
In our broad market business and distribution, we continue to see double-digit resales growth from the same quarter last year. However, we began to receive weaker bookings and slower resales within a broad base of customers in the latter part of the quarter. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation. We will be showcasing our latest technologies serving the digital factory at the Munich Electronic and Trade Show in November. Our Industry 4.0 areas of focus include: first, robust interface and communications products that bring intelligence to the factory H. Second, small thermal-efficient digitalized isolation and isolated power and protection solutions. And third, ultra-efficient and tiny footprint power modules. We believe that we're in the early days of deployment Industrial 4.0 control systems in factories around the world, and this movement has at least a few more decades before the market saturates.
In the December quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly down sequentially. This reflects our assumption that recent weakness in bookings and resales at broad-based customers and through distribution will continue, given the uncertain environment. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center.
In the September quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 9% from the same quarter last year. We experienced strong growth in 100G optical products for the data center, combined with slower growth in communications infrastructure.
In the December quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly down sequentially with the temporary slowdown in the 100G optical module shipments after many quarters of strong growth.
We believe we are in the middle innings in the deployment of 100G optical modules for hyperscale data centers and expect this business to return to growth in the first half of calendar 2019.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the September quarter, Consumer was up sequentially and up 13% from the same quarter last year. Due to continued strong performance of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables, smartphones, gaming and peripherals.
In the December quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to seasonality. 
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high-quality, diversified and long product life cycle markets, such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have lower capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows, giving us confidence to increase our share buyback plan during fiscal year 2019, returning 125% of our free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce."

We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment for 100% to 125% of free cash flow from Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year 20",1006,"Thanks, Tunç. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment for 100% to 125% of free cash flow from Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year 2019. At the current stock price, we expect the Q2 buyback will approximately double compared to Q1. Also, our board has approved a new share buyback authorization of $1.5 billion. Our increased share buyback program reflects our strong net cash position, and our belief that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. As a result of the increased buyback during this industry slowdown, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. 
Let me now turn to Q1 results.
Revenue for Q1 was $638 million, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 28% from Industrial, 28% Consumer, 21% Automotive, 20% Comms and Data Center and 3% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business comprised roughly half of our revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 46% of Maxim's revenue in the September quarter. We ended Q1 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Resales were up 14% from the same quarter a year ago, but resales to broad-based customers were weak. This softness affected distribution performance, primarily in the last month of the quarter. 
Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chain, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributor's performance, given the uncertainties in the industry. 
We remain committed to our days of channel inventory target of 60 days or less. 
Turning to the P&L, Maxim gross margin, excluding special items was 68.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and onetime items. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $194 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $243 million. Operating margin at 38% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 280 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. 
Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% above our guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the latest IRS proposed rules regarding tax reform. 
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.75, up 25% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $63 million in the fourth quarter to $2.56 billion. Please note that we pay out our employee bonus in Q1. 
Q1 inventory days ended at 124, down 3 days from Q4. Inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $915 million or 36% of revenue, which is up 12% over the same quarter last year. 
Our free cash flow yield is 6.7% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.24. 
For capital return, share repurchase total $112 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $128 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. This reflects the 10% increase in the dividend that our board approved last quarter.
Based on the increase in dividend and the yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.8%.
Moving on to guidance. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell in accounting at 1 distributor. Adjusting for both of these items, we estimate our normalized revenue in Q2 of last fiscal year was around $580 million. 
Our beginning Q2 backlog was $418 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected returns, we forecast Q2 revenue of $570 million to $610 million. Adjusting for the 14-week quarter and the sell-in accounting transition in the same quarter a year ago, the midpoint of our guidance reflects approximately 2% growth in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This is the result of continued content growth in Automotive, offset by the softness we are now seeing in the broad market.
Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68% down from Q1. This is driven by onetime items that benefited Q1 and lower revenue in Q2. The modest gross margin impact from lower Q2 revenues is due to our flexible manufacturing strategy. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be flat with Q1, despite the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase, due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q2, excluding special items, is expected to be 13%, flat with the prior quarter. 13% is our best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019.
For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high-end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue as we perform required maintenance at our internal fab. 
I would also like to note that we plan to pay off our $500 million bond that will come, due in November. 
In summary, we expect modest growth in Q2 revenue compared to the same quarter last year, due to our diversifying and market exposure, despite uncertainty in the current environment. 
Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability, while mitigating the risk of building excess inventory, and we will continue to tightly control operating expenses. All these factors result in high-quality earnings and free cash flow. Our positive net cash position allows us to increase our return of cash to shareholders from 100% to 125% in fiscal 2019. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But if you look at our business, we've had segments of it that we've been investing in. And of those segments, I think, the one that will be the most sensitive per unit will be the infotainment piece, and we do see that, that growth is still less than it was a year ago. So the content growth is still offsetting the unit decline since the way that I read that in infotainment. And in the other segments, large segments that we've invested, which are BMS and batter management systems and in ADAS, the growth there, we have is much, much larger than any decrease in unit sales of cars. So the combination of all that is anything of giving us still a good mid-teens-type growth, a long-term. Previously we've guided everybody to being in the low-teens. We're not really changing that. I think that, that will remain and basically, the large content growth we're seeing, plus secular growth in BMS and in ADAS systems is really letting us grow, despite the fact that there's some headwinds in terms of unit car sales globally right now. So at the current view of the review we gave up this quarter, we showed still growth year-over-year, that was pretty healthy. Beyond that, obviously it's hard to say, But our story is more of our content growth and secular growth driver story in Automotive rather than the unit car sales."

One, just the sort of the timing of the business and sort of the mix of business that we have. If you look at this quarter, we had a strong consumer quarter and some of those are larger customers, which get a little bit longer payment terms. And so you had a bit mix of that business. And if you're comparing this to year-over-year, we actually had some time that  other way for us a year ago, in Q1. I would say that we've absolutely, noticed that same fact, and we're aggressively working to bring down DSO back to kind around of the 40 days, which is our target, and you can expect that we'll execute on that. The other area in the working capital side is inventory, which we did bring down 3 days from 127 to 124 internally. But our goal is to get that down closer to our target of 110 days. And with our flexible manufacturing strategy, we're able to bring down and managed that inventory without having significant impact to our gross margin. So we're going to aggressively manage our working capital during this kind of soft spot in the industry. And of course, just by definition, right, as the revenue declines, you'll see benefits on the cash flow line from AR. So both bringing down the DSO and then the lower revenue will generate free cash flow growth for us in the next several quarters."

If you look at a lot of our direct customers, the larger customers, that's not where we're seeing this effect. However, I'll give you some commentary. We've asked the question 2 of our automation customers and their response basically was that they are hearing that some of their end customers are kind of hesitating to build up capacity in China. I don't know how widespread that is, but we've heard from some customers, kind of wait and see how the tariffs clear up. But I want to caution everybody, this is not like we're survey that we have lots of inputs from people, which is have a few customers saying this and the reason for the broad-based slowdown since we don't directly talk to them, it's really hard for us to say what the underlying causes for that.

So I just assume people knew, but just to make sure there's a clarification there. There's an accounting change that went into effect in the beginning of our first quarter fiscal year. We're basically we used to report in the accounts receivable line that used to be net of any reserves associated with that. And so, the accounting change now moved that reserve down into the liability side. So now you're seeing growth gross AR. And so you're just looking at that, you don't grab the reserve that's down in the liability section, then absolutely, it will look very, very large. So you have to do an adjusted DSO calculation. I'm sorry, about that. But just to get the apples-to-apples comparison. So anyway, that is one to clarify that point. That said, we still even on an adjusted basis, we've seen some increase in our DSO, and we're working to bring that down, but certainly, if you haven't made the adjustment, it would look much, much worse than it really is. So I apologize, but I just want to clarify that."

And prior cycles, I think, Maxim is in a much better able to successful, mainly because we're more diversified in our revenue base. We have a better profitable model and our gross margin less sensitive to volume. And your question about spread to other areas from Industrial, yes, some background sound -- all right the same terms of will explain to other market, it's really difficult for us to assess that. But the important thing to realize is that a bigger portion of our small customer from a broader customer revenue is coming from our industrial customers. So there is fewer revenues that going through small customers in other markets frankly. So that's one point. And the other one that I think most people already heard about his unit sales of cars that's kind of slowed down a little bit, but as I said we're pretty immune to that one.

Obviously, there is some, I had said that kind of publicly in prior occasions that we did sensitivity analysis, and we said that there was a 10% decline in revenue, it might be a 1% to 2% impact on the gross margin. And here, you can see in this quarter, we're down about 7.5% sequentially, and we're seeing about 1 point impact in gross margin as a result of that.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
Our September quarter results were solid. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue and profitability grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Consumer, Industrial and Data Center. Looking forward, we are seeing softening business conditions.  However, we believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment.  
Due to our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance, we plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year by increasing the share buyback.  We believe buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was also impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparisons adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items.
Let me now discuss September results and current quarter outlook, starting with Automotive.
In the September quarter, our Automotive business was up 15% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see the strongest demand signals from  battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content. Our content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications continue to be centered on power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. 
Recently, we introduced a new generation of serial link products for transporting video, audio and data in Automotive applications.  This GMSL-2 technology supports 6-gigabit per second transfers for display and driver assistance and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet. 
Our technology includes diagnostic capabilities to assist the health of the link and is compliant with automotive safety integrity level standards, making it suitable for autonomous drive applications. The first pair of products lead many GMSL-2 products to follow in the coming years. 
We received extremely strong customer pull for this product family.  Customers have ordered over 90,000 entering prototypes in the first 3 months, and we had already won designs at 7 different OEMs.
Turning to battery management systems for electric vehicles. We are growing our global footprint as design wins from prior years translate into today's revenue growth.  Battery management systems and driver assistance revenue grew over 60% from the same quarter last year. 
In the December quarter, we expect Automotive to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect the strength to come from content increases in secular growth areas, offsetting slowdown in global auto production. We expect battery management systems revenue for electric vehicles to nearly double from the same quarter last year with growth across several geographies.  In addition, we expect continued content growth in driver assistance applications.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the September quarter, Industrial was up 12% from the same quarter last year. Our growth in Industrial benefited from content growth in factory automation and medical products. 
In our broad market business and distribution, we continue to see double-digit resales growth from the same quarter last year. However, we began to receive weaker bookings and slower resales within a broad base of customers in the latter part of the quarter. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation. We will be showcasing our latest technologies serving the digital factory at the Munich electronica trade show in November. Our Industry 4.0 areas of focus include: first, robust interface and communications products that bring intelligence to the factory edge; second, small thermal-efficient digital isolation and isolated power and protection solutions; and third, ultra-efficient and tiny footprint power modules. 
We believe that we are in the early days of the deployment of Industrial 4.0 control systems in factories around the world, and this movement has at least a few more decades before the market saturates.
In the December quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly down sequentially. This reflects our assumption that recent weakness in bookings and resales at broad-based customers and through distribution will continue, given the uncertain environment. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center.  In the September quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 9% from the same quarter last year. We experienced strong growth in 100G optical products for the data center, combined with slower growth in communications infrastructure.
In the December quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly down sequentially with a temporary slowdown in 100G optical module shipments after many quarters of strong growth.
We believe we are in the middle innings in the deployment of 100G optical modules for hyperscale data centers and expect this business to return to growth in the first half of calendar 2019.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the September quarter, Consumer was up sequentially and up 13% from the same quarter last year. Due to continued strong performance of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables, smartphones, gaming and peripherals.  In the December quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to seasonality. 
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high-quality, diversified and long product life cycle markets, such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows, giving us confidence to increase our share buyback plan during fiscal year 2019, returning 125% of our free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce."

The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year",1004,"Thanks, Tunç. 
We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year 2019. At the current stock price, we expect the Q2 buyback will approximately double compared to Q1.  Also, our board has approved a new share buyback authorization of $1.5 billion. 
Our increased share buyback program reflects our strong net cash position and our belief that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. As a result of the increased buyback during this industry slowdown, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. 
Let me now turn to Q1 results.
Revenue for Q1 was $638 million, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 28% from Industrial, 28% Consumer, 21% Automotive, 20% Comms and Data Center and 3% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business comprised roughly half of our revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 46% of Maxim's revenue in the September quarter. We ended Q1 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Resales were up 14% from the same quarter a year ago, but resales to broad-based customers were weak. This softness affected distribution performance, primarily in the last month of the quarter. 
Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chains, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors' performance given the uncertainties in the industry.  We remain committed to our days of channel inventory target of 60 days or less. 
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and onetime items. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $194 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $243 million. Operating margin at 38% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 280 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. 
Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% above our guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the latest IRS-proposed rules regarding tax reform. 
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.75, up 25% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $63 million in the fourth quarter to $2.56 billion. Please note that we pay out our employee bonus in Q1. 
Q1 inventory days ended at 124, down 3 days from Q4. Inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter.  Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $915 million or 36% of revenue, which is up 12% over the same quarter last year.  Our free cash flow yield is 6.7% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.24. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $112 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $128 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. This reflects the 10% increase in the dividend that our board approved last quarter.  Based on the increase in dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.8%.
Moving on to guidance. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. Adjusting for both of these items, we estimate our normalized revenue in Q2 of last fiscal year was around $580 million. 
Our beginning Q2 backlog was $418 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue of $570 million to $610 million. Adjusting for the 14-week quarter and the sell-in accounting transition in the same quarter a year ago, the midpoint of our guidance reflects approximately 2% growth in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This is the result of continued content growth in Automotive, offset by the softness we are now seeing in the broad market.
Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68% down from Q1. This is driven by onetime items that benefited Q1 and lower revenue in Q2. The modest gross margin impact from lower Q2 revenue is due to our flexible manufacturing strategy. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be flat with Q1 despite the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q2, excluding special items, is expected to be 13%, flat with the prior quarter. 13% is our best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019.
For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue as we perform required maintenance at our internal fab. 
I would also like to note that we plan to pay off our $500 million bond that will come due in November. 
In summary, we expect modest growth in Q2 revenue compared to the same quarter last year due to our diversified end market exposure, despite uncertainty in the current environment. 
Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability while mitigating the risk of building excess inventory. And we will continue to tightly control operating expenses. All these factors result in high-quality earnings and free cash flow. Our positive net cash position allows us to increase our return of cash to shareholders from 100% to 125% in fiscal 2019. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But if you look at our business, we'd have segments of it that we've been investing in. And of those segments, I think the one that will be the most sensitive to  unit will be the infotainment piece. And we do see that, that growth is still less than it was a year ago. So the content growth is still offsetting the unit declines is the way that I read that in infotainment. And in the other segments, large segments that we've invested in, which are BMS or battery management systems and -- in ADAS, the growth there we have is much, much larger than any decrease in unit sales of cars. So the combination of all that is ending up giving us still a good mid-teens-type growth long-term. Previously, we've guided everybody to being in the low-teens. We're not really changing that. I think that, that remains. And basically, the large content growth we're seeing, plus secular growth in BMS and in ADAS systems is really letting us grow, despite the fact that there's some headwinds in terms of unit car sales globally right now. So at the current view and the view we gave of this quarter, we showed still growth year-over-year that was pretty healthy. Beyond that, obviously it's harder to say. But our story is more of a content growth and secular growth driver story in Automotive rather than the unit car sales."

One, just sort of the timing of the business and sort of the mix of business that we had. If you looked at this quarter, we had a strong consumer quarter, and some of those are larger customers which get a little bit longer payment terms. And so you had a bit mix of that business. And if you're comparing this to year-over-year, we actually had some timing that went the other way for us a year ago in Q1. I would say that we've absolutely noticed that same fact, and we're aggressively working to bring down DSO back to kind of around the 40 days, which is our target. And you can expect that we'll execute on that. The other area in the working capital side is inventory, which we did bring down 3 days from 127 to 124 internally. But our goal is to get that down closer to our target of 110 days. And with our flexible manufacturing strategy, we're able to bring down and manage that inventory without having significant impacts to our gross margin. So we're going to aggressively manage our working capital during this kind of soft spot in the industry. And of course, just by definition, right, as revenue declines, you'll see benefits on the cash flow line from AR. So both bringing down the DSO and then the lower revenue will generate free cash flow growth for us in the next several quarters."

If you look at a lot of our direct customers, the larger customers, that's not where we're seeing this effect. However, I'll give you some commentary. We have asked the question to some of our automation customers. And their response basically was that they are hearing that some of their end customers are kind of hesitating to build up capacity in China. I don't know how widespread that is, but we've heard it from some customers, kind of the wait and see how the tariffs clear up. But I want to caution everybody, this is not like we ran a survey and we have a lot of inputs from people, which is have a few customers saying this. And the reason for the broad-based slowdown, since we don't directly talk to them, is really hard for us to say what the underlying cause is for that. But it could be the things that you mentioned.

And so it's relatively new, and as Tunç just mentioned, we're trying to figure out what's going on and we're talking with our distribution partners. But it's very difficult for us to get a good handle on that. I will say, to the extent that, in certain geographies, where it's -- there's a Maxim specific story, whether that's BMS in China or Automotive in Japan or gaming in Japan, values parts of our distribution business were very strong.

I just think it's a result of inefficiencies in the supply chain. And what we've done is by moving to a flexible manufacturing strategy, I think we have that ability to react both on the upside and the downside to changes in demand. And so absolutely, I think we got a little bit ahead of ourselves when we got to 127 days last quarter, and I stated that very clearly. And we're committed to bringing that down. We brought it down 3 days this quarter to 124 and, absolutely, our goal, if you look at our internal plans, are to continue bringing that number down regardless of the demand environment. And because of that flexible manufacturing strategy, we don't expect that, that will have -- be a big headwind on gross margin. Obviously, there's some. I had said kind of publicly in prior occasions that we did sensitivity analysis, and we said that there was a 10% decline in revenue. It might be a 1% to 2% impact on the gross margin. And here, you can see in this quarter we're down about 7.5% sequentially, and we're seeing about a 1 point impact to gross margin as a result of that. So overall, we feel like the strategy we undertook a few years ago when we transferred the company, it's the right strategy throughout a cycle, both good and bad. And we feel comfortable with that. And we're absolutely committed to bringing down inventory, both off our balance sheet and within the channel."

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.Our September quarter results were solid.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
Our September quarter results were solid. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue and profitability grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Consumer, Industrial and Data Center. Looking forward, we are seeing softening business conditions.  However, we believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment.  
Due to our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance, we plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year by increasing the share buyback.  We believe buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was also impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparisons adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items.
Let me now discuss September results and current quarter outlook, starting with Automotive.
In the September quarter, our Automotive business was up 15% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see the strongest demand signals from  battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content. Our content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications continue to be centered on power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. 
Recently, we introduced a new generation of serial link products for transporting video, audio and data in Automotive applications.  This GMSL-2 technology supports 6-gigabit per second transfers for display and driver assistance and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet. 
Our technology includes diagnostic capabilities to assist the health of the link and is compliant with automotive safety integrity level standards, making it suitable for autonomous drive applications. The first pair of products lead many GMSL-2 products to follow in the coming years. 
We received extremely strong customer pull for this product family.  Customers have ordered over 90,000 entering prototypes in the first three months, and we had already won designs at seven different OEMs.
Turning to battery management systems for electric vehicles. We are growing our global footprint as design wins from prior years translate into today's revenue growth.  Battery management systems and driver assistance revenue grew over 60% from the same quarter last year. 
In the December quarter, we expect Automotive to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect the strength to come from content increases in secular growth areas, offsetting slowdown in global auto production. We expect battery management systems revenue for electric vehicles to nearly double from the same quarter last year with growth across several geographies.  In addition, we expect continued content growth in driver assistance applications.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the September quarter, Industrial was up 12% from the same quarter last year. Our growth in Industrial benefited from content growth in factory automation and medical products. 
In our broad market business and distribution, we continue to see double-digit resales growth from the same quarter last year. However, we began to receive weaker bookings and slower resales within a broad base of customers in the latter part of the quarter. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation. We will be showcasing our latest technologies serving the digital factory at the Munich electronica trade show in November. Our Industry 4.0 areas of focus include: First, robust interface and communications products that bring intelligence to the factory edge; second, small thermal-efficient digital isolation and isolated power and protection solutions; and third, ultra-efficient and tiny footprint power modules. 
We believe that we are in the early days of the deployment of Industrial 4.0 control systems in factories around the world, and this movement has at least a few more decades before the market saturates.
In the December quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly down sequentially. This reflects our assumption that recent weakness in bookings and resales at broad-based customers and through distribution will continue, given the uncertain environment. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center.  In the September quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 9% from the same quarter last year. We experienced strong growth in 100G optical products for the data center, combined with slower growth in communications infrastructure.
In the December quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly down sequentially with a temporary slowdown in 100G optical module shipments after many quarters of strong growth.
We believe we are in the middle innings in the deployment of 100G optical modules for hyperscale data centers and expect this business to return to growth in the first half of calendar 2019.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the September quarter, Consumer was up sequentially and up 13% from the same quarter last year. Due to continued strong performance of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables, smartphones, gaming and peripherals.  In the December quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to seasonality. 
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high-quality, diversified and long product life cycle markets, such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows, giving us confidence to increase our share buyback plan during fiscal year 2019, returning 125% of our free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce."

We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year",1004,"Thanks, Tunç. 
We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year 2019. At the current stock price, we expect the Q2 buyback will approximately double compared to Q1.  Also, our board has approved a new share buyback authorization of $1.5 billion. 
Our increased share buyback program reflects our strong net cash position and our belief that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. As a result of the increased buyback during this industry slowdown, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. 
Let me now turn to Q1 results.
Revenue for Q1 was $638 million, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 28% from Industrial, 28% Consumer, 21% Automotive, 20% Comms and Data Center, and 3% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business comprised roughly half of our revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 46% of Maxim's revenue in the September quarter. We ended Q1 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Resales were up 14% from the same quarter a year ago, but resales to broad-based customers were weak. This softness affected distribution performance, primarily in the last month of the quarter. 
Our delivery lead times are still five to seven weeks and have been in this range for over six years. We continue to closely manage our supply chains, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors' performance given the uncertainties in the industry.  We remain committed to our days of channel inventory target of 60 days or less. 
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and onetime items. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $194 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $243 million. Operating margin at 38% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 280 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. 
Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% above our guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the latest IRS-proposed rules regarding tax reform. 
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.75, up 25% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $63 million in the fourth quarter to $2.56 billion. Please note that we pay out our employee bonus in Q1. 
Q1 inventory days ended at 124, down three days from Q4. Inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter.  Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $915 million or 36% of revenue, which is up 12% over the same quarter last year.  Our free cash flow yield is 6.7% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.24. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $112 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $128 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. This reflects the 10% increase in the dividend that our board approved last quarter.  Based on the increase in dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.8%.
Moving on to guidance. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. Adjusting for both of these items, we estimate our normalized revenue in Q2 of last fiscal year was around $580 million. 
Our beginning Q2 backlog was $418 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue of $570 million to $610 million. Adjusting for the 14-week quarter and the sell-in accounting transition in the same quarter a year ago, the midpoint of our guidance reflects approximately 2% growth in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This is the result of continued content growth in Automotive, offset by the softness we are now seeing in the broad market.
Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68% down from Q1. This is driven by onetime items that benefited Q1 and lower revenue in Q2. The modest gross margin impact from lower Q2 revenue is due to our flexible manufacturing strategy. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be flat with Q1 despite the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q2, excluding special items, is expected to be 13%, flat with the prior quarter. 13% is our best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019.
For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue as we perform required maintenance at our internal fab. 
I would also like to note that we plan to pay off our $500 million bond that will come due in November. 
In summary, we expect modest growth in Q2 revenue compared to the same quarter last year due to our diversified end market exposure, despite uncertainty in the current environment. 
Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability while mitigating the risk of building excess inventory. And we will continue to tightly control operating expenses. All these factors result in high-quality earnings and free cash flow. Our positive net cash position allows us to increase our return of cash to shareholders from 100% to 125% in fiscal 2019. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But if you look at our business, we have segments of it that we've been investing in. And of those segments, I think the one that will be the most sensitive to  unit will be the infotainment piece. And we do see that, that growth is still less than it was a year ago. So the content growth is still offsetting the unit declines is the way that I read that in infotainment. And in the other segments, large segments that we've invested in, which are BMS or battery management systems and -- in ADAS, the growth there we have is much larger than any decrease in unit sales of cars. So the combination of all that is ending up giving us still a good mid-teens-type growth long-term. Previously, we've guided everybody to being in the low-teens. We're not really changing that. I think that remains. And basically, the large content growth we're seeing, plus secular growth in BMS and in ADAS systems is really letting us grow, despite the fact that there are some headwinds in terms of unit car sales globally right now. So at the current view and the view we gave of this quarter, we showed still growth year-over-year that was pretty healthy. Beyond that, obviously it's harder to say. But our story is more of a content growth and secular growth driver story in Automotive rather than the unit car sales."

One, just sort of the timing of the business and sort of the mix of business that we had. If you looked at this quarter, we had a strong consumer quarter, and some of those are larger customers which get a little bit longer payment terms. And so you had a little bit mix of that business. And if you're comparing this to year-over-year, we actually had some timing that went the other way for us a year ago in Q1. I would say that we've absolutely noticed that same fact, and we're aggressively working to bring down DSO back to kind of around the 40 days, which is our target. And you can expect that we'll execute on that. The other area in the working capital side is inventory, which we did bring down three days from 127 to 124 internally. But our goal is to get that down closer to our target of 110 days. And with our flexible manufacturing strategy, we're able to bring down and manage that inventory without having significant impacts to our gross margin. So we're going to aggressively manage our working capital during this kind of soft spot in the industry. And of course, just by definition, right, as revenue declines, you'll see benefits on the cash flow line from AR. So both bringing down the DSO and then the lower revenue will generate free cash flow growth for us in the next several quarters."

If you look at a lot of our direct customers, the larger customers, that's not where we're seeing this effect. However, I'll give you some commentary. We have asked the question to some of our automation customers. And their response basically was that they are hearing that some of their end customers are kind of hesitating to build up capacity in China. I don't know how widespread that is, but we've heard it from some customers, kind of the wait and see how the tariffs clear up. But I want to caution everybody, this is not like we ran a survey and we have a lot of inputs from people, which is what a few customers are saying this. And the reason for the broad-based slowdown, since we don't directly talk to them, is really hard for us to say what the underlying cause is for that. But it could be the things that you mentioned.

I will say, to the extent that, in certain geographies, where it's -- there's a Maxim specific story, whether that's BMS in China or Automotive in Japan or gaming in Japan, values parts of our distribution business were very strong. So automotive continues to do very well, and our broad-based consumer business is doing well also. So the real slowdown that we're seeing is mainly in kind of the industrial broad-based businesses."

On the tax side, the reason it came in at 13% versus our guidance of 9% to 10%, when we guided in July, it was based on our best understanding of kind of the new tax reform laws. The IRS subsequently released kind of proposed rules in September that countered some of our assumptions. And then we ended up at around 13%. We do expect that 13% based on what we know is kind of the best estimate to use for modeling going forward. And it was really about just learning, getting all the rules out there.

We brought it down three days this quarter to 124 and, absolutely, our goal, if you look at our internal plans, are to continue bringing that number down regardless of the demand environment. And because of that flexible manufacturing strategy, we don't expect that will be a big headwind on gross margin. Obviously, there's some. I had said kind of publicly in prior occasions that we did sensitivity analysis, and we said that there was a 10% decline in revenue. It might be a 1% to 2% impact on the gross margin. And here, you can see in this quarter we're down about 7.5% sequentially, and we're seeing about a 1 point impact to gross margin as a result of that. So overall, we feel like the strategy we undertook a few years ago when we transferred the company, it's the right strategy throughout a cycle, both good and bad. And we feel comfortable with that.

Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.Our September quarter results were solid.

We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated.
Our September quarter results were solid. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue and profitability grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Consumer, Industrial and Data Center. Looking forward, we are seeing softening business conditions.  However, we believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment.  
Due to our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance, we plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year by increasing the share buyback.  We believe buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was also impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparisons adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items.
Let me now discuss September results and current quarter outlook, starting with Automotive.
In the September quarter, our Automotive business was up 15% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see the strongest demand signals from  battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content. Our content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications continue to be centered on power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. 
Recently, we introduced a new generation of serial link products for transporting video, audio and data in Automotive applications.  This GMSL-2 technology supports 6-gigabit per second transfers for display and driver assistance and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet. 
Our technology includes diagnostic capabilities to assist the health of the link and is compliant with automotive safety integrity level standards, making it suitable for autonomous drive applications. The first pair of products lead many GMSL-2 products to follow in the coming years. 
We received extremely strong customer pull for this product family.  Customers have ordered over 90,000 entering prototypes in the first 3 months, and we had already won designs at 7 different OEMs.
Turning to battery management systems for electric vehicles. We are growing our global footprint as design wins from prior years translate into today's revenue growth.  Battery management systems and driver assistance revenue grew over 60% from the same quarter last year. 
In the December quarter, we expect Automotive to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect the strength to come from content increases in secular growth areas, offsetting slowdown in global auto production. We expect battery management systems revenue for electric vehicles to nearly double from the same quarter last year with growth across several geographies.  In addition, we expect continued content growth in driver assistance applications.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the September quarter, Industrial was up 12% from the same quarter last year. Our growth in Industrial benefited from content growth in factory automation and medical products. 
In our broad market business and distribution, we continue to see double-digit resales growth from the same quarter last year. However, we began to receive weaker bookings and slower resales within a broad base of customers in the latter part of the quarter. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation. We will be showcasing our latest technologies serving the digital factory at the Munich electronica trade show in November. Our Industry 4.0 areas of focus include: First, robust interface and communications products that bring intelligence to the factory edge; second, small thermal-efficient digital isolation and isolated power and protection solutions; and third, ultra-efficient and tiny footprint power modules. 
We believe that we are in the early days of the deployment of Industrial 4.0 control systems in factories around the world, and this movement has at least a few more decades before the market saturates.
In the December quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly down sequentially. This reflects our assumption that recent weakness in bookings and resales at broad-based customers and through distribution will continue, given the uncertain environment. 
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center.  In the September quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 9% from the same quarter last year. We experienced strong growth in 100G optical products for the data center, combined with slower growth in communications infrastructure.
In the December quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly down sequentially with a temporary slowdown in 100G optical module shipments after many quarters of strong growth.
We believe we are in the middle innings in the deployment of 100G optical modules for hyperscale data centers and expect this business to return to growth in the first half of calendar 2019.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the September quarter, Consumer was up sequentially and up 13% from the same quarter last year. Due to continued strong performance of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables, smartphones, gaming and peripherals.  In the December quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to seasonality. 
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high-quality, diversified and long product life cycle markets, such as Automotive and Industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows, giving us confidence to increase our share buyback plan during fiscal year 2019, returning 125% of our free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce."

We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year",1004,"Thanks, Tunç. 
We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal year 2019. The increase will all go towards incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal year 2019. At the current stock price, we expect the Q2 buyback will approximately double compared to Q1.  Also, our board has approved a new share buyback authorization of $1.5 billion. 
Our increased share buyback program reflects our strong net cash position and our belief that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. As a result of the increased buyback during this industry slowdown, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. 
Let me now turn to Q1 results.
Revenue for Q1 was $638 million, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 28% from Industrial, 28% Consumer, 21% Automotive, 20% Comms and Data Center, and 3% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business comprised roughly half of our revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 46% of Maxim's revenue in the September quarter. We ended Q1 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Resales were up 14% from the same quarter a year ago, but resales to broad-based customers were weak. This softness affected distribution performance, primarily in the last month of the quarter. 
Our delivery lead times are still 5 to 7 weeks and have been in this range for over 6 years. We continue to closely manage our supply chains, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors' performance given the uncertainties in the industry.  We remain committed to our days of channel inventory target of 60 days or less. 
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and onetime items. 
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $194 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $243 million. Operating margin at 38% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 280 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. 
Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% above our guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the latest IRS-proposed rules regarding tax reform. 
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.75, up 25% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $63 million in the fourth quarter to $2.56 billion. Please note that we pay out our employee bonus in Q1. 
Q1 inventory days ended at 124, down 3 days from Q4. Inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter.  Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter. 
Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $915 million or 36% of revenue, which is up 12% over the same quarter last year.  Our free cash flow yield is 6.7% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.24. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $112 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $128 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. This reflects the 10% increase in the dividend that our board approved last quarter.  Based on the increase in dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.8%.
Moving on to guidance. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. Adjusting for both of these items, we estimate our normalized revenue in Q2 of last fiscal year was around $580 million. 
Our beginning Q2 backlog was $418 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue of $570 million to $610 million. Adjusting for the 14-week quarter and the sell-in accounting transition in the same quarter a year ago, the midpoint of our guidance reflects approximately 2% growth in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This is the result of continued content growth in Automotive, offset by the softness we are now seeing in the broad market.
Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68% down from Q1. This is driven by onetime items that benefited Q1 and lower revenue in Q2. The modest gross margin impact from lower Q2 revenue is due to our flexible manufacturing strategy. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be flat with Q1 despite the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase due to continued tight cost controls. Our tax rate for Q2, excluding special items, is expected to be 13%, flat with the prior quarter. 13% is our best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019.
For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue as we perform required maintenance at our internal fab. 
I would also like to note that we plan to pay off our $500 million bond that will come due in November. 
In summary, we expect modest growth in Q2 revenue compared to the same quarter last year due to our diversified end market exposure, despite uncertainty in the current environment. 
Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability while mitigating the risk of building excess inventory. And we will continue to tightly control operating expenses. All these factors result in high-quality earnings and free cash flow. Our positive net cash position allows us to increase our return of cash to shareholders from 100% to 125% in fiscal 2019. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But if you look at our business, we have segments of it that we've been investing in. And of those segments, I think the one that will be the most sensitive to  unit will be the infotainment piece. And we do see that, that growth is still less than it was a year ago. So the content growth is still offsetting the unit declines is the way that I read that in infotainment. And in the other segments, large segments that we've invested in, which are BMS or battery management systems and -- in ADAS, the growth there we have is much larger than any decrease in unit sales of cars. So the combination of all that is ending up giving us still a good mid-teens-type growth long-term. Previously, we've guided everybody to being in the low-teens. We're not really changing that. I think that remains. And basically, the large content growth we're seeing, plus secular growth in BMS and in ADAS systems is really letting us grow, despite the fact that there are some headwinds in terms of unit car sales globally right now. So at the current view and the view we gave of this quarter, we showed still growth year-over-year that was pretty healthy. Beyond that, obviously it's harder to say. But our story is more of a content growth and secular growth driver story in Automotive rather than the unit car sales."

One, just sort of the timing of the business and sort of the mix of business that we had. If you looked at this quarter, we had a strong consumer quarter, and some of those are larger customers which get a little bit longer payment terms. And so you had a little bit mix of that business. And if you're comparing this to year-over-year, we actually had some timing that went the other way for us a year ago in Q1. I would say that we've absolutely noticed that same fact, and we're aggressively working to bring down DSO back to kind of around the 40 days, which is our target. And you can expect that we'll execute on that. The other area in the working capital side is inventory, which we did bring down 3 days from 127 to 124 internally. But our goal is to get that down closer to our target of 110 days. And with our flexible manufacturing strategy, we're able to bring down and manage that inventory without having significant impacts to our gross margin. So we're going to aggressively manage our working capital during this kind of soft spot in the industry. And of course, just by definition, right, as revenue declines, you'll see benefits on the cash flow line from AR. So both bringing down the DSO and then the lower revenue will generate free cash flow growth for us in the next several quarters."

If you look at a lot of our direct customers, the larger customers, that's not where we're seeing this effect. However, I'll give you some commentary. We have asked the question to some of our automation customers. And their response basically was that they are hearing that some of their end customers are kind of hesitating to build up capacity in China. I don't know how widespread that is, but we've heard it from some customers, kind of the wait and see how the tariffs clear up. But I want to caution everybody, this is not like we ran a survey and we have a lot of inputs from people, which is what a few customers are saying this. And the reason for the broad-based slowdown, since we don't directly talk to them, is really hard for us to say what the underlying cause is for that. But it could be the things that you mentioned.

And if that's the case, that seems to be worse than peers. And so I'm kind of curious if you can help me kind of parse out the different buckets in Industrial. Is this really being driven by the fact that you guys are over-indexed to factory automation? And that's been an area that's been weak up the supply chain for a couple of quarters now.

That said, I want to be very clear, when we do that math ourselves internally, we see our Industrial business in Q2 down low single digits, right? So it is down a little bit year-over-year, but it's low single digits. So from that point of view, I think, it's a little bit different than maybe the math that you did, but understand it's difficult for you to be able to do that math. When we look at it, it is the broad-based business. Some of that does get included in factory automation, and that may be our speculation as Tunç indicated, maybe just some latency on some of these CapEx projects on the factory automation side. But again, that's just what we've heard from a couple of our customers who then sell into China. So it's tough for us to know. But overall, we are seeing the slowdown in Industrial. We do see that's kind of down year-over-year in Q2 at around kind of low single digits. And that was after, again, it kind of held up in the first quarter, kind of growing 12% year-over-year."

There's an accounting change that went into effect in our -- beginning our first quarter of fiscal year where basically we used to report in the accounts receivable line, that used to be net of any reserves associated with that. And so the accounting change now moved that reserve down into the liability side. So now you're seeing gross AR. And so if you're just looking at that, and you have to -- if you don't grab the reserves that are down in the liability section, then absolutely it will look very large. So you have to do an adjusted DSO calculation. I'm sorry, about that. But just to get an apples-to-apples comparison. So anyway, so I just wanted to clarify that point.

So overall, we feel like the strategy we undertook a few years ago when we transferred the company, it's the right strategy throughout a cycle, both good and bad. And we feel comfortable with that. And we're absolutely committed to bringing down inventory, both off our balance sheet and within the channel."

So I think, from that point of view, I don't think we have any unique insights there. We're just managing it based on what we're seeing and working to pay close attention to resales and adjust shipment appropriately to find that right balance between supporting the appropriate level of inventories because, as I said, part of our distribution is supporting automotive, which is doing well, right? Part of it is supporting some of the similar broad-based consumer businesses that are doing well and so -- with the flipside being we need to closely manage the inventory for like the industrial and broad-based businesses. So we're trying to find that right balance while bringing it down to the 60 days. As I said, I think it's very difficult in the current flux of the current environment to predict exactly when that's going to happen. My commitment is we absolutely will continue to work on that and get to that level the exact quarter. So really depends on the environment and what happens with resales."

Concerning OpEx, clearly, we've said that we're going to keep it flat in the second quarter. And that's despite -- it's about a $3.5 million impact of our annual salary adjustments that happen in the September quarters and that you get a full quarter impact. So we're already offsetting that number in the quarter. And we'll do our normal -- we look at kind of the discretionary spending first, right, incremental headcount add, travel, if this extends over time. Tunç and I have been through these cycles many times, we have the playbook. We know exactly how to work through that. So we're confident that we'll be able to manage OpEx appropriately. I do want to say, we'll make sure we continue to invest in those important businesses for us, right, the high growth areas that we've talked about, whether that's automotive, factory automation, the data center broad-based consumer. But that said, within a large company, there are always opportunities to manage our cost appropriately. And I think, over the years, we've shown that we're pretty good managers in that area."
