Thank you, Anurag, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently-enacted tax reform",1271,"Okay. Thank you, Anurag, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently-enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding the benefit, non-GAAP earnings per share was up about 6%. Free cash flow increased 15% to $258 million, and we returned $143 million to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases.
We continue to build on first quarter momentum to drive top line growth with orders up 13% in the quarter and 24% in the first half. So let me start with a little more color on growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4.
Communication Systems revenue grew 18% in the quarter with tactical radio up 26% from strength in both DoD and international. DoD revenue increased 56% as the focus on readiness continue to drive demand. We booked about $100 million on radio revenue in the quarter from the Air Force and the Army as part of a multiyear plan to equip their security forces as they increase their presence overseas. For the first half, despite limited monetization activity, DoD orders nearly doubled and revenue grew 26% on the back of sustained readiness demand.
Army and SOCOM tactical modernization programs continued to advance and remain well supported. We will start delivering HMS and Manpack test radios as the Army prepares for a field-based risk reduction in the spring of this year, and we expect an initial production award toward the end of our fiscal '18. The protest on the Army 2-channel meter radio was recently denied, and we expect an order soon on the IDIQ while we work with the army as it prepares for tests. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we delivered our first set of test radios and remain on track to complete development this quarter and begin product deliveries in the fourth quarter. Overall, all programs are moving forward, and we continue to expect revenue to ramp starting in fiscal '19.
In international, revenue increased 9%, primarily from better-than-expected recovery in the Middle East where revenue was up by more than 50%, driven by modernization of security forces in Iraq, delivery of SINCGARS radio in Saudi Arabia and a technology refresh for a long standing customer in the region.
In Iraq, our pipeline is over $0.5 billion, and we're beginning to see several opportunities break free as the country moves from great funded counterterrorism to border security and eventually to command and control systems as they standardize across the forces and the Ministry of Interior. The solid first half performance in the Middle East, combined with strength in Africa, drove international revenue of 1% for the half and book-to-bill greater than 1, excluding Australia. 
Overall, for the first half of the fiscal year, tactical revenues increased 10%, orders grew 54% and book-to-bill was 1.6, resulting in a backlog increase of 59% year-over-year to $884 million. Within 50% of second half tactical revenue is covered in backlog, up 10 percentage points from this time last year, giving us comfort in achieving our increased segment guidance.
In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, 6% excluding the $22 million impact of ADS-B. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in avionics as we continue to benefit from higher volume and new content wins on F-35 to ramp up on the U.K. robotics program and growth in electronic warfare systems on legacy platforms such as the F/A-18 and international F-16s. 
Orders momentum continues to be strong in Electronic Systems and were up 37% for the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, avionics orders more than doubled compared with the last year as the ramp in F-35 continuous including the award of Lot 11, to release it stems and Blocks 12 to 14 for antennas. 
For F-35. In the first half, we received orders of $300 million, which is significantly more than we achieved in all of fiscal '17. In addition, F-35, we've seen strong first-half orders in both F-18 and F-16, receiving a combined $300 million for avionics and electronic warfare systems. We expect the order momentum across these 3 platforms to continue in the second half. Overall, for ES, first half orders grew 21%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and backlog increased 10% over the prior year.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was down 1% in the quarter as growth in classified programs and commercial reflectors was offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Orders continue to be strong in the classified arena with additional funding received for a smallsat program and a multimillion dollar award for advanced ground processing. And I'm pleased to note that our strong focus on program execution and operational excellence is strengthening our competitive position on key strategic programs. On GPS, we're executing well and we've established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering our fourth GPS III navigation payload in October and tracking well to deliver the fifth payload by the end of March. 
We've also developed and tested a fully digital mission data unit, which puts us in a strong position to compete for the upcoming GPS III 11 Plus award and maintain our incumbency. Similarly, on the SENSOR program, the large radar sustainment effort for the Air Force, we continued to improve on-time pfm, which is more than doubled since we acquired Exelis, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and positioning us well for a follow-on opportunities.
For Space and Intel, first half revenue was up 1%, orders grew by 9% and book-to-bill was greater than 1. Solid second quarter results for the company capped an encouraging first half performance with revenue up 3% and growth across all 3 segments. Order growth of 24%, book-to-bill of 1.3 and a backlog increase of 15% compared to the prior year. 
This combined with nearly 80% of back half revenues and backlog or high-probability follow-on opportunities, a strong and growing pipeline and $8 billion of proposals outstanding, give us confidence despite a lengthened CR to tighten our revenue guidance to up 3% to 4% from 2% to 4% previously. We're maintaining company operating margin guidance of 19% to 19.5%. But within that range, we're planning an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in IRAD to strengthen our position and capture new market opportunities in areas such as smallsats software-defined electronic warfare systems, open system avionics and robotics. These have been focused areas for several years. But due to our recent success and customer pool, we're increasing investment in these initiatives to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We're also investing in human capital and making a onetime stock grant of 10 shares to all nonexecutive employees, our most important asset in driving long-term customer and shareholder value. And then finally, we anticipate pre-funding the pension plan by $300 million during our fiscal Q3. We're making these additional investments in the context of the recently enacted tax legislation, which is a net positive for Harris and for the U.S. economy as a whole. We expect tax reform to reduce our effective rate by about 10 percentage points next year with about half of that reduction impacting this year and adding about $50 million to fiscal '18 net income. 
This benefit, combined with an improved revenue outlook and strong operational performance offsetting incremental investment, gives us confidence to increase fiscal '18 earnings per share guidance to $6.30 to $6.50 per share and free cash flow to about $900 million. 
So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before we open the call to questions. Rahul?"

Turning now to total company results on Slide 5. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding noncash charges in the quarter from a $52 million onetime write-down of deferred tax assets and a $12 million adjustment for deferred compensation, as well as prior year Exelis-acquisition-related charges. Revenue was up 6% during the second quarter and operating income was down $6 million as higher volume and operational efficiency were more than offset by contracted adjustments in the mission networks business. EPS was up 21% or $0.29, including a $0.21 incremental benefit from tax reform. This benefit included a catch up from the first quarter. Resulting in 11-point reduction in the Q2 tax rate. Since the tax reform impact must be spread across all 4 quarters of our fiscal '18. For the first half, revenue was up 3% and operating income was up 1% despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Operating margin was 18.9%. Free cash flow was robust in the first half at $330 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. 
On the last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. 
Turning now to segment details on Slide 6. Communication Systems second quarter revenue was $489 million, up 18% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in tactical, nightvision revenue was also up double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 19% at $144 million compared with $121 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, operational excellence and integration savings. 
Orders grew by 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the quarter. For the first half of the year, segment revenue was up 7% and operating income was up 10%. Operating margin of 21.9% was up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Segment orders increased 44% in the first half and book-to-bill was 1.5. Notably, the book-to-bill was above 1 for each of the 3 businesses in the segment: tactical communications, ADS-B and nightvision. With attendant include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation.
On Slide 7, Electronic Systems revenue was $584 million, up 2% for the quarter. The $33 million decline in segment operating income was driven by contract adjustments in the mission networks business, including a $22 million headwind from the ADS-B program, increased R&D expense and unfavorable mix, partially offset by a strong performance on electronic warfare program and a benefit of higher volume in avionics.
First half segment revenue was up 2% while operating income was down 14% or $36 million as the increase in volume was offset by ADS-B headwind and an increase in R&D. Operating margins remained strong at 18.7%. 
On Slide 8, Space and Intelligence Systems segment operating system was up 7% on revenue decline of 1%. For the first half, revenue for this segment increased 1% and operating income was up 8%, resulting in 120 basis points of margin expansion from productivity and incremental pension income.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 for full year guidance. As Bill indicated, we now expect revenues to be up 3% to 4% versus up 2% to 4% in the prior guidance, due to increased strength in Tactical Communications and in avionics. We are increasing the EPS guidance from a range of $5.85 to $6.05 to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, driven by a better-than-expected operational performance and benefits from tax reform, partially offset by reinvestment into certain key franchisees. Strong execution is expected to deliver an additional $0.13 EPS on higher volume and strong program management, partially offset by unfavorable mix in Electronic Systems. We will reinvest $0.12 of that into innovation and affordability and bid and proposal activity across the corporation. Tax reform and other tax efficiencies will drive the effective tax rate in fiscal '18, down to approximately 23%. This, combined with operational changes, results in a $0.45 EPS increase. Total company margin is still expected to remain robust at 19% to 19.5%. We are tightening free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million from a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting the cash benefit from tax reform.
Turning now to outlook at the segment level. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% versus up 3% to 5% previously, driven by strength in Tactical Communication and Night Vision. Operating margin guidance range of 19.9 -- sorry. Operating margin guidance range of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be at the top end of the previous range, up 4% to 5% versus up 3% to 5% previously from better-than-expected outlook in avionics and electronic warfare. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18% to 19% versus 19% to 20% previously due to increased R&D and bid and proposal investment and unfavorable mix shift from products to program businesses. 
Based on intelligence revenue guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 1%. Operating margin are now expected to be between 17% to 18% versus 16.5% to 17.5% previously, driven by higher productivity and strong program execution, partially offset by reinvestment in R&D.
On Slide 11, we're updating the guidance for tax and share repurchases. We have completed the $150 million of share buyback that we had initially planned and now expect to repurchase an additional $50 million in the second half, for a total of $200 million in share repurchases for the fiscal year.
And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

As we see a CR return into a healthy budget into what we hope to be a very healthy defense spending line in fiscal '19, my expectation is we'll continue to see orders grow beyond '18 into '19, and hopefully, beyond '19. So we've got a good start. We're building some good momentum. We're seeing lead time in order conversion opportunity to order about the same. I know there's an important effort focused on shortening the acquisition time line, both in U.S. DoD as well as on the FMS side. We haven't seen anything yet except for a couple of pretty quick turn investments and readiness that for a more urgent requirements. But I know that the department is focused on both accelerating DoD purchases while getting SMS contracts done a lot faster than have been before."

It was a little bit stronger in Q2 than we expect to see that pipeline velocity in the Middle East, a little bit faster than we had expected, which I think is good news, and hopefully, we'll see that trend continuing into the back half. So the Middle East has been very strong. Again, keep in mind, it's been coming off a relatively low base. So that's going to be a pretty good. It's pretty broad-based. Iraq a very important in the Middle East. Saudi has been a good opportunity. We see good opportunity in North America as well as well as sub-Saharan. Overall, pretty good trajectory in the Middle East. We will see the Asia Pacific regions grow pretty aggressively this year, probably about the same, about 40%, principally due to Australia but also because of some other countries in South East Asia. So again, good momentum in Asia. We'll see a tick down this year in Europe. It'll be down probably double digits off of our record year last year, record second half in Eastern Europe. And then Central and Latin America as well as Central Asia will likely be down pretty significantly this year. So overall, international on a revenue basis, we still see it where we did before, flat to down slightly. Although the DoD business will be stronger this year."

So now we're guiding at $900 million. Tax reform this year is about 50. Because of elongated continuing resolution, some of our revenue -- the price towards the back end of the year and what that means is we might have a little pressure on collection, which is why we conservatively lose at our free cash guidance to about $900 million. Going into next year, with tax reform, we see an incremental $50 million to $75 million of free cash just on the Act itself. So that puts us to a $950 million to $975 million earnings growth and working capital performance. We can see a path to getting to $1 billion in fiscal '19. And as we think about how we deploy that, overall, we don't see much of a change to our overall philosophy on capital deployment. We'll continue to remain balanced and shareholder-friendly and making sure we maintain a healthy balance sheet. While they mentioned that in the near-term, we're going to increase our share repurchases this year from $150 million to $200 million, we will pay a debt that's due. It's about $0.5 billion in April. We're going to pre-fund our pension, and we anticipate doing that here on our third quarter. We'll borrow to do that. And as we go into '19 and beyond longer-term, not much of a change in our overall priorities. We'll continue to completely fund all of our great investments we have internally in R&D and capital spending. We're going to continue to pay a very good dividend, which we've been paying pretty aggressively over the last decade or more. And any balance that's remaining on free cash will be deployed to M&A or share buyback. And if you think about the numbers, we'll be generating probably a couple of billion dollars between '18 and '19 gives us a lot of firepower for both share buyback and potential M&A."

So we don't have any internal capacity constraints relative to satisfying the increasing demand. What we have done is step up over the last 5 or 6 years in R&D. We're doing that again internal investments in R&D. Harris spends more than a relative basis, relative to revenue, then anyone on our segment, and we're taking it up a even further. We've been running about 5% of revenue. This year, we'll take it to 5.2%, 5.3%. So we continue to invest very heavily in both R&D and over a period of time in capital spending.

I saw the same reports about the '19 budget. But again, until it actually drops, we don't know the size of it. And even more importantly, the mix across the different programs. But your point about what's driving communications, tactical radio revenue, certainly, last year, it was a lot around investments in Eastern Europe in Coms, to help drive interoperability across NATO forces with your U.S. forces. And that was a big part of the surge we saw last year in Eastern Europe and it continues at a pretty good pace even this year. And when you step back and look at some of the investments that the DoD is making now today in radios and maybe in some of the hesitancy going forward is really rethinking exactly what kind of radio comps and they want, what sort of waveforms they need and what's the bandwidth, are they may be jammed, are they low probability of interception and its action. They are changing  their thinking about that and not just communication but also electronic warfare business, and it's the fundamental driver for why we're seeing increased investments and growth outlook in electronic warfare is all around our forces and our partner forces can compete in places like Europe given the Russian threat. So that is the backdrop for a lot of the trends that we see in the business. And frankly, a lot of the investments that we're talking about that we've made and are making now in our business. To enhance our communications and spectrum warfare capabilities and drive opportunities here to communicate broadly, convey information but anti-jam so they hop very quickly as well as the LPI LPD. So long answer, Pete. But that's really the backdrop of what's happening driving an important trend across all of our Coms and EW businesses."

And we've seen that happen only 117 G. We'll see the same thing happen under our version of the Manpack. So the capabilities will change over time. What we have demonstrated, and our competitive space demonstrated through the customer test  is the basic functionalities of the radio, the waveforms. And what they are now testing are some of the deferred threshold requirement lacked the ability for the radios to use the waveform, a very complicated waveform. Now we've perfected at that and putting into the WIN-T G. I don't expect that to be a problem and how it works in the Manpack. So they're just going to test them in the deferred threshold requirements is what's happening right now.

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone.

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently-enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding the benefit, non-GAAP earnings per share was up about 6%. Free cash flow increased 15% to $258 million, and we returned $143 million to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases.
We continue to build on first-quarter momentum to drive top line growth with orders up 13% in the quarter and 24% in the first half. So let me start with a little more color on growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4.
Communication Systems revenue grew 18% in the quarter, with tactical radio up 26% from strength in both DoD and international. DoD revenue increased 56% as the focus on readiness continue to drive demand. We booked about $100 million on radio revenue in the quarter from the Air Force and the Army as part of a multiyear plan to equip their security forces as they increase their presence overseas. For the first half, despite limited modernization activity, DoD orders nearly doubled, and revenue grew 26% on the back of sustained readiness demand.
Army and SOCOM tactical modernization programs continue to advance and remain well supported. We will start delivering HMS and Manpack test radios as the Army prepares for Field-based Risk Reduction in the spring of this year, and we expect an initial production award toward the end of our fiscal '18. The protest on the Army 2-channel leader radio was recently denied, and we expect an order soon on the IDIQ while we work with the army as it prepares for tests. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we've delivered our first set of test radios and remain on track to complete development this quarter and begin product deliveries in the fourth quarter. Overall, all programs are moving forward, and we continue to expect revenue to ramp, starting in fiscal '19.
In international, revenue increased 9%, primarily from better-than-expected recovery in the Middle East, where revenue was up by more than 50%, driven by modernization of security forces in Iraq, delivery of SINCGARS radios to Saudi Arabia and a technology refresh for a long-standing customer in the region.
In Iraq, our pipeline is over $0.5 billion, and we're beginning to see several opportunities break free as the country moves from grant-funded counterterrorism to border security, and eventually to command and control systems as they standardize across the forces and the Ministry of Interior. The solid first-half performance in the Middle East, combined with strength in Africa, drove international revenue of 1% for the half and book-to-bill greater than 1, excluding Australia. 
Overall, for the first half of the fiscal year, tactical revenues increased 10%, orders grew 54% and book-to-bill was 1.6, resulting in a backlog increase of 59% year-over-year to $884 million. Within 50% of second-half tactical revenue is covered in backlog, up 10 percentage points from this time last year, giving us comfort in achieving our increased segment guidance.
In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, 6% excluding the $22 million impact of ADS-B. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Avionics as we continue to benefit from higher volume and new content wins on F-35; the ramp-up on the U.K. robotics program; and growth in electronic warfare systems on legacy platforms, such as the F/A-18 and international F-16s. 
Orders momentum continues to be strong in Electronic Systems and were up 37% for the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, Avionics orders more than doubled compared with the last year, as the ramp on F-35 continues, including the award of lot 11 for release systems and block buy of lots 12 through 14 for antennas. 
For F-35, in the first half, we received orders of $300 million, which is significantly more than what we achieved in all of fiscal '17. In addition to F-35, we've seen strong first-half orders on both F-18 and F-16, receiving a combined $300 million for Avionics and electronic warfare systems. We expect the order momentum across these 3 platforms to continue in the second half. Overall, for ES, first-half orders grew 21%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and backlog increased 10% over the prior year.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as growth in classified programs and commercial reflectors was offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Orders continue to be strong in the classified arena, with additional funding received for a smallsat program and a multimillion dollar award for advanced ground processing. And I'm pleased to note that our strong focus on program execution and operational excellence is strengthening our competitive position on key strategic programs. On GPS, we're executing well. And we've established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering our fourth GPS III navigation payload in October and tracking well to deliver the fifth payload by the end of March. 
We've also developed and tested a fully digital mission data unit, which puts us in a strong position to compete for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award and maintain our incumbency. Similarly, on the SENSOR program, the large ground radar sustainment effort for the Air Force, we continue to improve on-time performance, which has more than doubled since we acquired Exelis, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and positioning us well for follow-on opportunities.
For Space and Intel, first-half revenue was up 1%, orders grew by 9% and book-to-bill was greater than 1. Solid second-quarter results for the company capped an encouraging first-half performance, with revenue up 3% and growth across all 3 segments, order growth of 24%, book-to-bill of 1.3 and a backlog increase of 15% compared to the prior year. 
This, combined with nearly 80% of back-half revenues in backlog or high-probability follow-on opportunities, a strong and growing pipeline and $8 billion of proposals outstanding, give us confidence despite a lengthened CR to tighten our revenue guidance to up 3% to 4% from 2% to 4% previously. We're maintaining company operating margin guidance of 19% to 19.5%. But within that range, we're planning an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in IRAD to strengthen our position and capture new market opportunities in areas such as smallsats, software-defined electronic warfare systems, open system avionics and robotics. These have been focused areas for several years. But due to our recent success and customer pull, we're increasing investment in these initiatives to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We're also investing in human capital and making a onetime stock grant of 10 shares to all nonexecutive employees, our most important asset in driving long-term customer and shareholder value. And then finally, we anticipate pre-funding the pension plan by $300 million during our fiscal Q3. We're making these additional investments in the context of the recently-enacted tax legislation, which is a net positive for Harris and for the U.S. economy as a whole. We expect tax reform to reduce our effective rate by about 10 percentage points next year, with about half of that reduction impacting this year and adding about $50 million to fiscal '18 net income. 
This benefit, combined with an improved revenue outlook and strong operational performance offsetting incremental investment, gives us confidence to increase fiscal '18 earnings per share guidance to $6.30 to $6.50 per share and free cash flow to about $900 million. 
So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before we open the call to questions. Rahul?"

Turning now to total company results on Slide 5. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding noncash charges in the quarter from a $52 million onetime write-down of deferred tax assets and a $12 million adjustment for deferred compensation, as well as prior-year Exelis acquisition-related charges. Revenue was up 6% during the second quarter, and operating income was down $6 million as higher volume and operational efficiencies were more than offset by contract adjustments in the mission networks business. EPS was up 21% or $0.29, including a $0.21 incremental benefit from tax reform. This benefit included a catch-up from the first quarter, resulting in 11-point reduction in the Q2 tax rate since the tax reform impact must be spread across all 4 quarters of our fiscal '18. For the first half, revenue was up 3%, and operating income was up 1% despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Operating margin was 18.9%. Free cash flow was robust in the first half at $330 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. 
On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. 
Turning now to segment details on Slide 6. Communication Systems second quarter revenue was $489 million, up 18% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in tactical, night vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 19% at $144 million compared with $121 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, operational excellence and integration savings. 
Orders grew by 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the quarter. For the first half of the year, segment revenue was up 7%, and operating income was up 10%. Operating margin of 29.1% was up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Segment orders increased 44% in the first half, and book-to-bill was 1.5. Notably, the book-to-bill was above 1 for each of the 3 businesses in the segment: tactical communications, PSPC and night vision. We've continued to include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation.
On Slide 7, Electronic Systems revenue was $584 million, up 2% for the quarter. The $33 million decline in segment operating income was driven by contract adjustments in the mission networks business, including a $22 million headwind from the ADS-B program, increased R&D expense and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong performance on electronic warfare programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics.
First half segment revenue was up 2%, while operating income was down 14% or $36 million as the increase in volume was offset by ADS-B headwind and an increase in R&D. Operating margin remained strong at 18.7%. 
On Slide 8, Space and Intelligence Systems segment operating system was up 7% on revenue decline of 1%. For the first half, revenue for the segment increased 1%, and operating income was up 8%, resulting in 120 basis points of margin expansion from productivity and incremental pension income.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 for full-year guidance. As Bill indicated, we now expect revenue to be up 3% to 4% versus up 2% to 4% in the prior guidance due to increased strength in Tactical Communications and in Avionics. We're increasing the EPS guidance from a range of $5.85 to $6.05 to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, driven by better-than-expected operational performance and benefits of the tax reform, partially offset by reinvestment into certain key franchisees. Strong execution is expected to deliver an additional $0.13 through EPS on higher volume and strong program management, partially offset by unfavorable mix in Electronic Systems. We will reinvest $0.12 of that into innovation and affordability and bid and proposal activity across the corporation. Tax reform and other tax efficiencies will drive the effective tax rate in fiscal '18 down to approximately 23%. This, combined with operational changes, results in a $0.45 EPS increase. Total company margin is still expected to remain robust at 19% to 19.5%. We are tightening free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million from a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting the cash benefit from tax reform.
Turning now to outlook at the segment level. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% versus up 3% to 5% previously, driven by strength in Tactical Communication and Night Vision. Operating margin guidance range of 19.9 -- -- sorry, operating margin guidance range of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be at the top end of the previous range, up 4% to 5% versus up 3% to 5% previously from better-than-expected outlook in Avionics and electronic warfare. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18% to 19% versus 19% to 20% previously due to increased R&D and bid and proposal investment and unfavorable mixed shift from products to program businesses. 
Space and Intelligence revenue guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 1%. Operating margins are now expected to be between 17% to 18% versus 16.5% to 17.5% previously, driven by higher productivity and strong program execution, partially offset by reinvestments in R&D.
On Slide 11, we're updating the guidance for tax and share repurchases. We have completed the $150 million of share buyback that we had initially planned, and now expect to repurchase an additional $50 million in the second half for a total of $200 million in share repurchases for the fiscal year.
And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And as we see a CR turn into a healthy budget into what we hope to be a very healthy defense spending line in fiscal '19, my expectation is we'll continue to see orders grow beyond '18 into '19 and, hopefully, beyond '19. So we've got a good start. We're building some good momentum. We're seeing lead time in order conversion opportunity to order about the same. I know there's an important effort focused on shortening the acquisition time line, both in U.S. DoD as well as on the FMS side. We haven't seen anything yet, except for a couple of pretty quick turn investments in readiness that -- for more urgent requirements. But I know the department is focused on both accelerating DoD purchase as well as getting FMS contracts done a lot faster than have been before."

We're seeing the pipeline velocity in the Middle East a little bit faster than we had expected, which I think is good news. And hopefully, we'll see that trend continuing into the back half. So the Middle East has been very strong. Again, keep in mind, it's coming off of a relatively low base. So that's going to be pretty good. It's pretty broad-based. So Iraq is very important in the Middle East. Saudi has been a good opportunity. We see good opportunities in Northern Africa as well, and as well as Sub-Saharan. So overall, pretty good trajectory in the Middle East. We will see the Asia Pacific region grow pretty aggressively this year, probably about the same, about 40%, principally due to Australia, but also because of some other countries in Southeast Asia. So again, good momentum in Asia. We'll see a tick-down this year in Europe. It'll be down probably double digits off a record year last year, a record second half in Eastern Europe. And then Central in Latin America as well as Central Asia will likely be down pretty significantly this year. So overall, international, on a revenue basis, we still see it where we did before, flat to down slightly, although the DoD business will be stronger this year."

So now, we're guiding at $900 million. Tax reform this year is about $50 million. But because of elongated continuing resolution, some of our revenue will price-flip to the back end of the year. And what that means is we might have a little pressure on collection, so which is why we conservatively boosted our free cash guidance to about $900 million. Going into next year, with tax reform, we see an incremental $50 million to $75 million of free cash just on tax itself. So that puts us in the $950 million to $975 million range with earnings growth and working capital performance. We can see a path to getting to $1 billion in fiscal '19. And as we think about how we deploy that, overall, we don't see much of a change to our overall philosophy on capital deployment. We'll continue to remain balanced and shareholder-friendly, and making sure we maintain a healthy balance sheet. Rahul did mention that in the near-term, we're going to increase our share repurchases this year from $150 million to $200 million. We will pay a debt that's due. It's about $0.5 billion in April. We're going to pre-fund our pension. We anticipate doing that here on our third quarter. We'll borrow to do that. And as we go into '19 and beyond, longer-term, not much of a change in our overall priorities. We'll continue to complete -- to fund all of the great investments we have internally in R&D and capital spending. We're going to continue to pay a very good dividend, which we've been paying pretty aggressively over the last decade or more, and any balance that's remaining on free cash will be deployed to M&A or share buyback. And if you think about the numbers, we'll be generating probably a couple of billion dollars between '18 to '19. It gives a lot of firepower for both share buyback as well as potential M&A."

So we don't have any internal capacity constraints relative to satisfying the increasing demand. But what we have done is step up over the last 5 or 6 years in R&D. We're doing that again, internal investments in R&D. Harris spends more than -- on a relative basis relative to revenue than anyone on our segment, and we're taking it up even further. We've been running at about 5% of revenue. And this year, we'll take it up to 5.2%, 5.3%. So we continue to invest very heavily in both R&D and over a period of time in capital spending.

So we have opportunities to change out Avionics from newer platforms as well as next-gen platforms in Avionics. We're developing software-defined electronic warfare systems, both for legacy platforms, but also perhaps onboarding on to the newer-generation aircraft. We're investing in robotics. We won a pretty good-size contract for EOD in the U.K., and we think there's just good opportunities to grow robotics beyond U.K. into other international markets maybe and into the U.S. DoD over time as well.

And we, very recently, within the last year, won the electronic unit for the Panoramic Cockpit Display. That was about $320 million. That's the front end of its development. So that'll onboard probably several years from now. And then we won about 1 year ago, or within the last year, the Aircraft Memory System upgrade with a contract value at about $140 million. So overall, we're running $2.2 million. But we do see opportunities to drive that up if we're successful in winning the open system mission computer, which will be down-selected again to a final win or 1 of the 3 down-selected companies today, but the final one probably within the next couple of years.

We're going to be at probably 85% funded. So we've done a very good job, I believe, in integration and managing our balance sheet. Now we're generating very strong cash. The working capital turns have improved pretty dramatically, both for Harris as well as for legacy Exelis, and you're seeing that come through in our free cash guidance. As we get into next year, we'll have a little bit of debt to pay down. It depends upon the length of time we borrow to fund the pension, but it does leave quite a bit of capacity for buybacks for M&A. And the way I look at it is we'll evaluate things very, very carefully. The prices are relatively high, and we don't need to buy anything to be scaled. We think we're scaled in a place where we want to be. We like the position we happen to have, but we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to bolt on, arrive to the company in the key franchises that we're in today. Other than that, I don't think we have much more to say."

A lot has been written on kind of the incremental Russian military threat to ground threat, and it sounds like the U.S. Army as well as Congress are pretty concerned about that. So I'm wondering, are you sensing recently more kind of threat-driven incremental demand in radios? And at same time that's going on, we're hearing recently that the fiscal '19 budget could be really attractive, maybe approaching 7% growth over -- per year over the next couple of years if you kind of average it out. So between the incremental threat out there and the inflecting budgets, Communication Systems, would you err on the side of the outlook for Comms being closer to high single digits now than the prior mid-single-digit outlook you gave? Or is international side -- is there just not enough visibility on the international side right now?"

I saw the same reports about the '19 budget. But again, until that actually drops, we don't know the size of it and, even more importantly, the mix across the different programs. But to your point about what's driving communications, tactical radio revenue, certainly, last year, it was a lot around investments in Eastern Europe in Comms to help drive interoperability across NATO forces and with U.S. forces. And that was a big part of the surge we saw last year in Eastern Europe, and it continues at a pretty good pace even this year. And when you step back and look at some of the investments that the DoD is making now today in radios and maybe even some of the hesitancy going forward is really rethinking exactly what kind of radio comps they want, what sort of waveforms they need. What's the bandwidth? Are they anti-jam? Are they at low probability of interception and detection? They're changing their thinking about it. And it spills from not just communication, but also in electronic warfare business, and is a fundamental driver for why we're seeing increased investment and growth outlook in electronic warfare. It's all around how do our forces and our partner forces compete in places like Europe given the Russian threat. So that is the backdrop for a lot of the trends that we've seen in the business and, frankly, a lot of the investment that we're talking about that we've made and are making now in our business to enhance our communications and spectrum warfare capabilities and drive opportunities here to communicate broadly, convey information, but to have then anti-jam. So they hop very quickly, as well as the LPI/LPD. So long answer, Pete, but that's really the backdrop of what's happening, driving an important trend across all of our Comms and EW businesses."

We're working very closely with the Army as they rethink what they want the structure of the network, the architecture of the network to look like. It was a good result that they've separated the upper tactical network, meaning WIN-T, from the lower tactical, meaning the radios. And they're moving forward with radio purchases. We do have components on the upper tactical WIN-T system. We have the radio, the Highband Networking Radio. We have the waveform, which is HNW. We have a new version of the waveform that's sitting out there now in the repository. I do believe that no matter what they do on the upper tactical network, there's a role for Harris to play. In fact, I think it may be increasing as opposed to decreasing. The radio we've developed and the waveform that's been developed gives you a much faster rate of transmission. There's more nodes. It's a more mobile system, solving a lot of the issues that the Army's had with WIN-T.

We'll see the same thing happen on our version of the Manpack. So the capabilities will change over time. What we have demonstrated and our competitor in the space have demonstrated through the customer test is basic functionality of the radio and the waveforms. And what they're now testing are some of the deferred threshold requirements like the ability for the radio to use the MUOS waveform, a very complicated waveform. Now we've perfected that in putting it into the 117G. I don't expect that to be a problem and how it works in the Manpack. So they're just going to test them. The deferred threshold requirements is what's happening right now. But I do believe, over time, these requirements will continue to shift as the threat environment shifts."

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone.

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently-enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding the benefit, non-GAAP earnings per share was up about 6%. Free cash flow increased 15% to $258 million, and we returned $143 million to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases.
We continue to build on first-quarter momentum to drive top line growth with orders up 13% in the quarter and 24% in the first half. So let me start with a little more color on growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4.
Communication Systems revenue grew 18% in the quarter, with tactical radio up 26% from strength in both DoD and international. DoD revenue increased 56% as the focus on readiness continued to drive demand. We booked about $100 million on radio revenue in the quarter from the Air Force and the Army as part of a multiyear plan to equip their security forces as they increase their presence overseas. For the first half, despite limited modernization activity, DoD orders nearly doubled, and revenue grew 26% on the back of sustained readiness demand.
Army and SOCOM tactical modernization programs continue to advance and remain well supported. We will start delivering HMS and Manpack test radios as the Army prepares for Field-based Risk Reduction in the spring of this year, and we expect an initial production award toward the end of our fiscal '18. The protest on the Army 2-channel leader radio was recently denied, and we expect an order soon on the IDIQ while we work with the Army as it prepares for tests. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we've delivered our first set of test radios and remain on track to complete development this quarter and begin product deliveries in the fourth quarter. Overall, all programs are moving forward, and we continue to expect revenue to ramp, starting in fiscal '19.
In international, revenue increased 9%, primarily from better-than-expected recovery in the Middle East, where revenue was up by more than 50%, driven by modernization of security forces in Iraq, delivery of SINCGARS radios to Saudi Arabia and a technology refresh for a long-standing customer in the region.
In Iraq, our pipeline is over $0.5 billion, and we're beginning to see several opportunities break free as the country moves from grant-funded counterterrorism to border security, and eventually to command and control systems as they standardize across the forces and the Ministry of Interior. The solid first-half performance in the Middle East, combined with strength in Africa, drove international revenue of 1% for the half and book-to-bill greater than 1, excluding Australia. 
Overall, for the first half of the fiscal year, tactical revenues increased 10%, orders grew 54% and book-to-bill was 1.6, resulting in a backlog increase of 59% year-over-year to $884 million. More than 50% of second-half tactical revenue is covered in backlog, up 10 percentage points from this time last year, giving us comfort in achieving our increased segment guidance.
In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, 6% excluding the $22 million impact of ADS-B. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Avionics as we continue to benefit from higher volume and new content wins on F-35; the ramp-up on the U.K. robotics program; and growth in electronic warfare systems on legacy platforms, such as the F/A-18 and international F-16s. 
Orders momentum continues to be strong in Electronic Systems and were up 37% for the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, Avionics orders more than doubled compared with the last year, as the ramp on F-35 continues, including the award of lot 11 for release systems and block buy of lots 12 through 14 for antennas. 
For F-35, in the first half, we received orders of $300 million, which is significantly more than what we achieved in all of fiscal '17. In addition to F-35, we've seen strong first-half orders on both F-18 and F-16, receiving a combined $300 million for Avionics and electronic warfare systems. We expect the order momentum across these 3 platforms to continue in the second half. Overall, for ES, first-half orders grew 21%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and backlog increased 10% over the prior year.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as growth in classified programs and commercial reflectors was offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Orders continue to be strong in the classified arena, with additional funding received for a smallsat program and a multimillion dollar award for advanced ground processing. And I'm pleased to note that our strong focus on program execution and operational excellence is strengthening our competitive position on key strategic programs. On GPS, we're executing well. And we've established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering our fourth GPS III navigation payload in October and tracking well to deliver the fifth payload by the end of March. 
We've also developed and tested a fully digital mission data unit, which puts us in a strong position to compete for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award and maintain our incumbency. Similarly, on the SENSOR program, the large ground radar sustainment effort for the Air Force, we continue to improve on-time performance, which has more than doubled since we acquired Exelis, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and positioning us well for follow-on opportunities.
For Space and Intel, first-half revenue was up 1%, orders grew by 9% and book-to-bill was greater than 1. Solid second-quarter results for the company capped an encouraging first-half performance, with revenue up 3% and growth across all 3 segments, order growth of 24%, book-to-bill of 1.3 and a backlog increase of 15% compared to the prior year. 
This, combined with nearly 80% of back-half revenues in backlog or high-probability follow-on opportunities, a strong and growing pipeline and $8 billion of proposals outstanding, give us confidence despite a lengthened CR to tighten our revenue guidance to up 3% to 4% from 2% to 4% previously. We're maintaining company operating margin guidance of 19% to 19.5%. But within that range, we're planning an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in IRAD to strengthen our position and capture new market opportunities in areas such as smallsats, software-defined electronic warfare systems, open system avionics and robotics. These have been focused areas for several years. But due to our recent success and customer pull, we're increasing investment in these initiatives to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We're also investing in human capital and making a onetime stock grant of 10 shares to all nonexecutive employees, our most important asset in driving long-term customer and shareholder value. And then finally, we anticipate pre-funding the pension plan by $300 million during our fiscal Q3. We're making these additional investments in the context of the recently-enacted tax legislation, which is a net positive for Harris and for the U.S. economy as a whole. We expect tax reform to reduce our effective rate by about 10 percentage points next year, with about half of that reduction impacting this year and adding about $50 million to fiscal '18 net income. 
This benefit, combined with an improved revenue outlook and strong operational performance offsetting incremental investment, gives us confidence to increase fiscal '18 earnings per share guidance to $6.30 to $6.50 per share and free cash flow to about $900 million. 
So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before we open the call to questions. Rahul?"

Turning now to total company results on Slide 5. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding noncash charges in the quarter from a $52 million onetime write-down of deferred tax assets and a $12 million adjustment for deferred compensation, as well as prior-year Exelis acquisition-related charges. Revenue was up 6% during the second quarter, and operating income was down $6 million as higher volume and operational efficiencies were more than offset by contract adjustments in the mission networks business. EPS was up 21% or $0.29, including a $0.21 incremental benefit from tax reform. This benefit included a catch-up from the first quarter, resulting in 11-point reduction in the Q2 tax rate since the tax reform impact must be spread across all 4 quarters of our fiscal '18. For the first half, revenue was up 3%, and operating income was up 1% despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Operating margin was 18.9%. Free cash flow was robust in the first half at $330 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. 
On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. 
Turning now to segment details on Slide 6. Communication Systems second quarter revenue was $489 million, up 18% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in tactical, night vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 19% at $144 million compared with $121 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, operational excellence and integration savings. 
Orders grew by 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the quarter. For the first half of the year, segment revenue was up 7%, and operating income was up 10%. Operating margin of 29.1% was up 70- basis points versus the prior year. Segment orders increased 44% in the first half, and book-to-bill was 1.5. Notably, the book-to-bill was above 1 for each of the 3 businesses in the segment: tactical communications, PSPC and night vision. We've continued to include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation.
On Slide 7, Electronic Systems revenue was $584 million, up 2% for the quarter. The $33 million decline in segment operating income was driven by contract adjustments in the mission networks business, including a $22 million headwind from the ADS-B program, increased R&D expense and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong performance on electronic warfare programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics.
First half segment revenue was up 2%, while operating income was down 14% or $36 million as the increase in volume was offset by ADS-B headwind and an increase in R&D. Operating margin remained strong at 18.7%. 
On Slide 8, Space and Intelligence Systems segment operating income was up 7% on revenue decline of 1%. For the first half, revenue for the segment increased 1%, and operating income was up 8%, resulting in 120- basis points of margin expansion from productivity and incremental pension income.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 for full-year guidance. As Bill indicated, we now expect revenue to be up 3% to 4% versus up 2% to 4% in the prior guidance due to increased strength in Tactical Communications and in Avionics. We're increasing the EPS guidance from a range of $5.85 to $6.05 to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, driven by better-than-expected operational performance and benefits of the tax reform, partially offset by reinvestment into certain key franchisees. Strong execution is expected to deliver an additional $0.13 for EPS on higher volume and strong program management, partially offset by unfavorable mix in Electronic Systems. We will reinvest $0.12 of that into innovation and affordability and bid and proposal activity across the corporation. Tax reform and other tax efficiencies will drive the effective tax rate in fiscal '18 down to approximately 23%. This, combined with operational changes, results in a $0.45 EPS increase. Total company margin is still expected to remain robust at 19% to 19.5%. We are tightening free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million from a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting the cash benefit from tax reform.
Turning now to outlook at the segment level. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% versus up 3% to 5% previously, driven by strength in Tactical Communication and Night Vision. Operating margin guidance range of 19.9 -- -- sorry, operating margin guidance range of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be at the top end of the previous range, up 4% to 5% versus up 3% to 5% previously from better-than-expected outlook in Avionics and electronic warfare. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18% to 19% versus 19% to 20% previously due to increased R&D and bid and proposal investment and unfavorable mixed shift from products to program businesses. 
Space and Intelligence revenue guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 1%. Operating margins are now expected to be between 17% to 18% versus 16.5% to 17.5% previously, driven by higher productivity and strong program execution, partially offset by reinvestments in R&D.
On Slide 11, we're updating the guidance for tax and share repurchases. We have completed the $150 million of share buyback that we had initially planned, and now expect to repurchase an additional $50 million in the second half for a total of $200 million in share repurchases for the fiscal year.
And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And as we see a CR turn into a healthy budget into what we hope to be a very healthy defense spending line in fiscal '19, my expectation is we'll continue to see orders grow beyond '18 into '19 and, hopefully, beyond '19. So we've got a good start. We're building some good momentum. We're seeing lead time in order conversion opportunity to order about the same. I know there's an important effort focused on shortening the acquisition time line, both in U.S. DoD as well as on the FMS side. We haven't seen anything yet, except for a couple of pretty quick turn investments in readiness that -- for more urgent requirements. But I know the department is focused on both accelerating DoD purchase as well as getting FMS contracts done a lot faster than have been before."

We're seeing the pipeline velocity in the Middle East a little bit faster than we had expected, which I think is good news. And hopefully, we'll see that trend continuing into the back half. So the Middle East has been very strong. Again, keep in mind, it's coming off of a relatively low base. So that's going to be pretty good. It's pretty broad-based. So Iraq is very important in the Middle East. Saudi has been a good opportunity. We see good opportunities in Northern Africa as well, and as well as Sub-Saharan. So overall, pretty good trajectory in the Middle East. We will see the Asia Pacific region grow pretty aggressively this year, probably about the same, about 40%, principally due to Australia, but also because of some other countries in Southeast Asia. So again, good momentum in Asia. We'll see a tick-down this year in Europe. It'll be down probably double digits off a record year last year, a record second half in Eastern Europe. And then Central in Latin America as well as Central Asia will likely be down pretty significantly this year. So overall, international, on a revenue basis, we still see it where we did before, flat to down slightly, although the DoD business will be stronger this year."

So now, we're guiding at $900 million. Tax reform this year is about $50 million. But because of elongated continuing resolution, some of our revenue will price-flip to the back end of the year. And what that means is we might have a little pressure on collection, so which is why we conservatively boosted our free cash guidance to about $900 million. Going into next year, with tax reform, we see an incremental $50 million to $75 million of free cash just on tax itself. So that puts us in the $950 million to $975 million range with earnings growth and working capital performance. We can see a path to getting to $1 billion in fiscal '19. And as we think about how we deploy that, overall, we don't see much of a change to our overall philosophy on capital deployment. We'll continue to remain balanced and shareholder-friendly, and making sure we maintain a healthy balance sheet. Rahul did mention that in the near-term, we're going to increase our share repurchases this year from $150 million to $200 million. We will pay a debt that's due. It's about $0.5 billion in April. We're going to pre-fund our pension. We anticipate doing that here on our third quarter. We'll borrow to do that. And as we go into '19 and beyond, longer-term, not much of a change in our overall priorities. We'll continue to complete -- to fund all of the great investments we have internally in R&D and capital spending. We're going to continue to pay a very good dividend, which we've been paying pretty aggressively over the last decade or more, and any balance that's remaining on free cash will be deployed to M&A or share buyback. And if you think about the numbers, we'll be generating probably a couple of billion dollars between '18 to '19. It gives a lot of firepower for both share buyback as well as potential M&A."

We've got a relatively brand new tactical radio facility up in Rochester that's running at 60% or so utilization. So we don't have any internal capacity constraints relative to satisfying the increasing demand. But what we have done is step up over the last 5 or 6 years in R&D. We're doing that again, internal investments in R&D. Harris spends more than -- on a relative basis relative to revenue than anyone on our segment, and we're taking it up even further. We've been running at about 5% of revenue. And this year, we'll take it up to 5.2%, 5.3%. So we continue to invest very heavily in both R&D and over a period of time in capital spending.

We expect to capture a good chunk of that. On the F-35, we're still in low-rate production. And we're on Lots 11 and 12, and we're still ramping up.

I saw the same reports about the '19 budget. But again, until that actually drops, we don't know the size of it and, even more importantly, the mix across the different programs. But to your point about what's driving communications, tactical radio revenue, certainly, last year, it was a lot around investments in Eastern Europe in Comms to help drive interoperability across NATO forces and with U.S. forces. And that was a big part of the surge we saw last year in Eastern Europe, and it continues at a pretty good pace even this year. And when you step back and look at some of the investments that the DoD is making now today in radios and maybe even some of the hesitancy going forward is really rethinking exactly what kind of radio comps they want, what sort of waveforms they need. What's the bandwidth? Are they anti-jam? Are they at low probability of interception and detection? They're changing their thinking about it. And it spills from not just communication, but also to the electronic warfare business, and is a fundamental driver for why we're seeing increased investment and growth outlook in electronic warfare. It's all around how do our forces and our partner forces compete in places like Europe given the Russian threat. So that is the backdrop for a lot of the trends that we've seen in the business and, frankly, a lot of the investment that we're talking about that we've made and are making now in our business to enhance our communications and spectrum warfare capabilities and drive opportunities here to communicate broadly, convey information, but to have them be anti-jam. So they hop very quickly, as well as the LPI/LPD. So long answer, Pete, but that's really the backdrop of what's happening, driving an important trend across all of our Comms and EW businesses."

So Pete, on balance, I think we're probably as good, if not better positioned, on WIN-T now than we were before."

We'll see the same thing happen on our version of the Manpack. So the capabilities will change over time. What we have demonstrated and our competitor in the space have demonstrated through the customer test is basic functionality of the radio and the waveforms. And what they're now testing are some of the deferred threshold requirements like the ability for the radio to use the MUOS waveform, a very complicated waveform. Now we've perfected that in putting it into the 117G. I don't expect that to be a problem and how it works in the Manpack. So they're just going to test them. The deferred threshold requirements is what's happening right now. But I do believe, over time, these requirements will continue to shift as the threat environment shifts."

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone.

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently-enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding the benefit, non-GAAP earnings per share was up about 6%. Free cash flow increased 15% to $258 million, and we returned $143 million to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases.
We continue to build on first-quarter momentum to drive top line growth with orders up 13% in the quarter and 24% in the first half. So let me start with a little more color on growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4.
Communication Systems revenue grew 18% in the quarter, with tactical radio up 26% from strength in both DoD and international. DoD revenue increased 56% as the focus on readiness continued to drive demand. We booked about $100 million on radio revenue in the quarter from the Air Force and the Army as part of a multiyear plan to equip their security forces as they increase their presence overseas. For the first half, despite limited modernization activity, DoD orders nearly doubled, and revenue grew 26% on the back of sustained readiness demand.
Army and SOCOM tactical modernization programs continue to advance and remain well supported. We will start delivering HMS and Manpack test radios as the Army prepares for Field-based Risk Reduction in the spring of this year, and we expect an initial production award toward the end of our fiscal '18. The protest on the Army 2-channel leader radio was recently denied, and we expect an order soon on the IDIQ while we work with the Army as it prepares for tests. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we've delivered our first set of test radios and remain on track to complete development this quarter and begin product deliveries in the fourth quarter. Overall, all programs are moving forward, and we continue to expect revenue to ramp, starting in fiscal '19.
In international, revenue increased 9%, primarily from better-than-expected recovery in the Middle East, where revenue was up by more than 50%, driven by modernization of security forces in Iraq, delivery of SINCGARS radios to Saudi Arabia and a technology refresh for a long-standing customer in the region.
In Iraq, our pipeline is over $0.5 billion, and we're beginning to see several opportunities break free as the country moves from grant-funded counterterrorism to border security, and eventually to command and control systems as they standardize across the forces and the Ministry of Interior. The solid first-half performance in the Middle East, combined with strength in Africa, drove international revenue of 1% for the half and book-to-bill greater than 1, excluding Australia. 
Overall, for the first half of the fiscal year, tactical revenues increased 10%, orders grew 54% and book-to-bill was 1.6, resulting in a backlog increase of 59% year-over-year to $884 million. More than 50% of second-half tactical revenue is covered in backlog, up 10 percentage points from this time last year, giving us comfort in achieving our increased segment guidance.
In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, 6% excluding the $22 million impact of ADS-B. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Avionics as we continue to benefit from higher volume and new content wins on F-35; the ramp-up on the U.K. robotics program; and growth in electronic warfare systems on legacy platforms, such as the F/A-18 and international F-16s. 
Orders momentum continues to be strong in Electronic Systems and were up 37% for the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, Avionics orders more than doubled compared with the last year, as the ramp on F-35 continues, including the award of lot 11 for release systems and block buy of lots 12 through 14 for antennas. 
For F-35, in the first half, we received orders of $300 million, which is significantly more than what we achieved in all of fiscal '17. In addition to F-35, we've seen strong first-half orders on both F-18 and F-16, receiving a combined $300 million for Avionics and electronic warfare systems. We expect the order momentum across these 3 platforms to continue in the second half. Overall, for ES, first-half orders grew 21%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and backlog increased 10% over the prior year.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as growth in classified programs and commercial reflectors was offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Orders continue to be strong in the classified arena, with additional funding received for a smallsat program and a multimillion-dollar award for advanced ground processing. And I'm pleased to note that our strong focus on program execution and operational excellence is strengthening our competitive position on key strategic programs. On GPS, we're executing well. And we've established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering our fourth GPS III navigation payload in October and tracking well to deliver the fifth payload by the end of March. 
We've also developed and tested a fully digital mission data unit, which puts us in a strong position to compete for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award and maintain our incumbency. Similarly, on the SENSOR program, the large ground radar sustainment effort for the Air Force, we continue to improve on-time performance, which has more than doubled since we acquired Exelis, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and positioning us well for follow-on opportunities.
For Space and Intel, first-half revenue was up 1%, orders grew by 9% and book-to-bill was greater than 1. Solid second-quarter results for the company capped an encouraging first-half performance, with revenue up 3% and growth across all 3 segments, order growth of 24%, book-to-bill of 1.3 and a backlog increase of 15% compared to the prior year. 
This, combined with nearly 80% of back-half revenues in backlog or high-probability follow-on opportunities, a strong and growing pipeline and $8 billion of proposals outstanding, give us confidence despite a lengthened CR to tighten our revenue guidance to up 3% to 4% from 2% to 4% previously. We're maintaining company operating margin guidance of 19% to 19.5%. But within that range, we're planning an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in IRAD to strengthen our position and capture new market opportunities in areas such as smallsats, software-defined electronic warfare systems, open system avionics and robotics. These have been focused areas for several years. But due to our recent success and customer pull, we're increasing investment in these initiatives to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We're also investing in human capital and making a onetime stock grant of 10 shares to all nonexecutive employees, our most important asset in driving long-term customer and shareholder value. And then finally, we anticipate pre-funding the pension plan by $300 million during our fiscal Q3. We're making these additional investments in the context of the recently-enacted tax legislation, which is a net positive for Harris and for the U.S. economy as a whole. We expect tax reform to reduce our effective rate by about 10 percentage points next year, with about half of that reduction impacting this year and adding about $50 million to fiscal '18 net income. 
This benefit, combined with an improved revenue outlook and strong operational performance offsetting incremental investment, gives us confidence to increase fiscal '18 earnings per share guidance to $6.30 to $6.50 per share and free cash flow to about $900 million. 
So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before we open the call to questions. Rahul?"

Turning now to total company results on Slide 5. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding noncash charges in the quarter from a $52 million onetime write-down of deferred tax assets and a $12 million adjustment for deferred compensation, as well as prior-year Exelis acquisition-related charges. Revenue was up 6% during the second quarter, and operating income was down $6 million as higher volume and operational efficiencies were more than offset by contract adjustments in the mission networks business. EPS was up 21% or $0.29, including a $0.21 incremental benefit from tax reform. This benefit included a catch-up from the first quarter, resulting in 11-point reduction in the Q2 tax rate since the tax reform impact must be spread across all 4 quarters of our fiscal '18. For the first half, revenue was up 3%, and operating income was up 1% despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Operating margin was 18.9%. Free cash flow was robust in the first half at $330 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. 
On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. 
Turning now to segment details on Slide 6. Communication Systems second quarter revenue was $489 million, up 18% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in tactical, night vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 19% at $144 million compared with $121 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, operational excellence and integration savings. 
Orders grew by 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the quarter. For the first half of the year, segment revenue was up 7%, and operating income was up 10%. Operating margin of 29.1% was up 70- basis points versus the prior year. Segment orders increased 44% in the first half, and book-to-bill was 1.5. Notably, the book-to-bill was above 1 for each of the 3 businesses in the segment: tactical communications, PSPC and night vision. We've continued to include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation.
On Slide 7, Electronic Systems revenue was $584 million, up 2% for the quarter. The $33 million decline in segment operating income was driven by contract adjustments in the mission networks business, including a $22 million headwind from the ADS-B program, increased R&D expense and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong performance on electronic warfare programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics.
First half segment revenue was up 2%, while operating income was down 14% or $36 million as the increase in volume was offset by ADS-B headwind and an increase in R&D. Operating margin remained strong at 18.7%. 
On Slide 8, Space and Intelligence Systems segment operating income was up 7% on revenue decline of 1%. For the first half, revenue for the segment increased 1%, and operating income was up 8%, resulting in 120- basis points of margin expansion from productivity and incremental pension income.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 for full-year guidance. As Bill indicated, we now expect revenue to be up 3% to 4% versus up 2% to 4% in the prior guidance due to increased strength in Tactical Communications and in Avionics. We're increasing the EPS guidance from a range of $5.85 to $6.05 to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, driven by better-than-expected operational performance and benefits of the tax reform, partially offset by reinvestment into certain key franchisees. Strong execution is expected to deliver an additional $0.13 for EPS on higher volume and strong program management, partially offset by unfavorable mix in Electronic Systems. We will reinvest $0.12 of that into innovation and affordability and bid and proposal activity across the corporation. Tax reform and other tax efficiencies will drive the effective tax rate in fiscal '18 down to approximately 23%. This, combined with operational changes, results in a $0.45 EPS increase. Total company margin is still expected to remain robust at 19% to 19.5%. We are tightening free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million from a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting the cash benefit from tax reform.
Turning now to outlook at the segment level. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% versus up 3% to 5% previously, driven by strength in Tactical Communication and Night Vision. Operating margin guidance range of 19.9 -- -- sorry, operating margin guidance range of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be at the top end of the previous range, up 4% to 5% versus up 3% to 5% previously from better-than-expected outlook in Avionics and electronic warfare. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18% to 19% versus 19% to 20% previously due to increased R&D and bid and proposal investment and unfavorable mixed shift from products to program businesses. 
Space and Intelligence revenue guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 1%. Operating margins are now expected to be between 17% to 18% versus 16.5% to 17.5% previously, driven by higher productivity and strong program execution, partially offset by reinvestments in R&D.
On Slide 11, we're updating the guidance for tax and share repurchases. We have completed the $150 million of share buyback that we had initially planned, and now expect to repurchase an additional $50 million in the second half for a total of $200 million in share repurchases for the fiscal year.
And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So we've got a good start. We're building some good momentum. We're seeing lead time in order conversion opportunity to order about the same. I know there's an important effort focused on shortening the acquisition time line, both in U.S. DoD as well as on the FMS side. We haven't seen anything yet, except for a couple of pretty quick turn investments in readiness that -- for more urgent requirements. But I know the department is focused on both accelerating DoD purchase as well as getting FMS contracts done a lot faster than have been before."

So the Middle East has been very strong. Again, keep in mind, it's coming off of a relatively low base. So that's going to be pretty good. It's pretty broad-based. So Iraq is very important in the Middle East. Saudi has been a good opportunity. We see good opportunities in Northern Africa as well, and as well as Sub-Saharan. So overall, pretty good trajectory in the Middle East. We will see the Asia Pacific region grow pretty aggressively this year, probably about the same, about 40%, principally due to Australia, but also because of some other countries in Southeast Asia. So again, good momentum in Asia. We'll see a tick-down this year in Europe. It'll be down probably double digits off a record year last year, a record second half in Eastern Europe. And then Central in Latin America as well as Central Asia will likely be down pretty significantly this year. So overall, international, on a revenue basis, we still see it where we did before, flat to down slightly, although the DoD business will be stronger this year."

So now, we're guiding at $900 million. Tax reform this year is about $50 million. But because of elongated continuing resolution, some of our revenue will price-flip to the back end of the year. And what that means is we might have a little pressure on collection, so which is why we conservatively boosted our free cash guidance to about $900 million. Going into next year, with tax reform, we see an incremental $50 million to $75 million of free cash just on tax itself. So that puts us in the $950 million to $975 million range with earnings growth and working capital performance. We can see a path to getting to $1 billion in fiscal '19. And as we think about how we deploy that, overall, we don't see much of a change to our overall philosophy on capital deployment. We'll continue to remain balanced and shareholder-friendly, and making sure we maintain a healthy balance sheet. Rahul did mention that in the near-term, we're going to increase our share repurchases this year from $150 million to $200 million. We will pay a debt that's due. It's about $0.5 billion in April. We're going to pre-fund our pension. We anticipate doing that here on our third quarter. We'll borrow to do that. And as we go into '19 and beyond, longer-term, not much of a change in our overall priorities. We'll continue to complete -- to fund all of the great investments we have internally in R&D and capital spending. We're going to continue to pay a very good dividend, which we've been paying pretty aggressively over the last decade or more, and any balance that's remaining on free cash will be deployed to M&A or share buyback. And if you think about the numbers, we'll be generating probably a couple of billion dollars between '18 to '19. It gives a lot of firepower for both share buyback as well as potential M&A."

So we don't have any internal capacity constraints relative to satisfying the increasing demand. But what we have done is step up over the last 5 or 6 years in R&D. We're doing that again, internal investments in R&D. Harris spends more than -- on a relative basis relative to revenue than anyone on our segment, and we're taking it up even further. We've been running at about 5% of revenue. And this year, we'll take it up to 5.2%, 5.3%. So we continue to invest very heavily in both R&D and over a period of time in capital spending.

We're developing software-defined electronic warfare systems, both for legacy platforms, but also perhaps onboarding on to the newer-generation aircraft. We're investing in robotics.

The working capital turns have improved pretty dramatically, both for Harris as well as for legacy Exelis, and you're seeing that come through in our free cash guidance. As we get into next year, we'll have a little bit of debt to pay down. It depends upon the length of time we borrow to fund the pension, but it does leave quite a bit of capacity for buybacks for M&A. And the way I look at it is we'll evaluate things very, very carefully. The prices are relatively high, and we don't need to buy anything to be scaled. We think we're scaled in a place where we want to be.

A lot has been written on kind of the incremental Russian military threat to ground threat, and it sounds like the U.S. Army as well as Congress are pretty concerned about that. So I'm wondering, are you sensing recently more kind of threat-driven incremental demand in radios? And at same time that's going on, we're hearing recently that the fiscal '19 budget could be really attractive, maybe approaching 7% growth over -- per year over the next couple of years if you kind of average it out. So between the incremental threat out there and the inflecting budgets, Communication Systems, would you err on the side of the outlook for Comms being closer to high single digits now than the prior mid-single-digit outlook you gave? Or is international side -- is there just not enough visibility on the international side right now?"

I saw the same reports about the '19 budget. But again, until that actually drops, we don't know the size of it and, even more importantly, the mix across the different programs. But to your point about what's driving communications, tactical radio revenue, certainly, last year, it was a lot around investments in Eastern Europe in Comms to help drive interoperability across NATO forces and with U.S. forces. And that was a big part of the surge we saw last year in Eastern Europe, and it continues at a pretty good pace even this year. And when you step back and look at some of the investments that the DoD is making now today in radios and maybe even some of the hesitancy going forward is really rethinking exactly what kind of radio comps they want, what sort of waveforms they need. What's the bandwidth? Are they anti-jam? Are they at low probability of interception and detection? They're changing their thinking about it. And it spills from not just communication, but also to the electronic warfare business, and is a fundamental driver for why we're seeing increased investment and growth outlook in electronic warfare. It's all around how do our forces and our partner forces compete in places like Europe given the Russian threat. So that is the backdrop for a lot of the trends that we've seen in the business and, frankly, a lot of the investment that we're talking about that we've made and are making now in our business to enhance our communications and spectrum warfare capabilities and drive opportunities here to communicate broadly, convey information, but to have them be anti-jam. So they hop very quickly, as well as the LPI/LPD. So long answer, Pete, but that's really the backdrop of what's happening, driving an important trend across all of our Comms and EW businesses."

We're working very closely with the Army as they rethink what they want the structure of the network, the architecture of the network to look like. It was a good result that they've separated the upper tactical network, meaning WIN-T, from the lower tactical, meaning the radios and they're moving forward with radio purchases. We do have components on the upper tactical WIN-T system. We have the radio, the Highband Networking Radio. We have the waveform, which is HNW. We have a new version of the waveform that's sitting out there now in the repository. I do believe that no matter what they do on the upper tactical network, there's a role for Harris to play. In fact, I think it may be increasing as opposed to decreasing. The radio we've developed and the waveform that's been developed gives you a much faster rate of transmission. There's more nodes. It's a more mobile system, solving a lot of the issues that the Army's had with WIN-T.

What we have demonstrated and our competitor in the space have demonstrated through the customer test is basic functionality of the radio and the waveforms. And what they're now testing are some of the deferred threshold requirements like the ability for the radio to use the MUOS waveform, a very complicated waveform. Now we've perfected that in putting it into the 117G. I don't expect that to be a problem and how it works in the Manpack. So they're just going to test them.

Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance, with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first three quarters up 17% [ on ] 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow. 
The highlight, again, this quarter and for the year is our strong quarter momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year. 
So let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4. Communication Systems revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Night Vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter, with revenue [ up ] 48%, as the focus on readiness continued to drive growth across the services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communicating equipment to software-defined radios. This sustain readiness in demand has given a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year. 
International Tactical revenue was down 12%, as expected, on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 '17 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of these Australian modernization program in the Asia-Pacific region. Strong orders growth of [ 15% ] for the quarter and 36% year-to-date have nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect International will be flat to slightly down. 
As we've been communicating, our tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain international leadership and expand our addressable market into network systems, ISR and airborne. And we continue to execute well against her strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the ominous bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY '18, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY '18 president's budget request. We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter and earlier this week, we received an [ Elrip ] delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. 
On the Army 2-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon with an award anticipated sometime this summer. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we delivered additional test radios during the quarter, and we'll ramp production into the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal '19. 
Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leverage our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and update the military communications network. This built on past successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness. 
And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a 5-year, $130 million [indiscernible] source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video [ dadeling ] device to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win against the incumbent helps us increase our share wallet of ground devices and positions us well to grow in the airborne ISR segment going forward. 
Overall, for the first three quarters, Tactical revenue increased 7%, with a book-to-bill of 1.4, resulting in a 74% year-over-year backlog increase to $880 million. This growth in Tactical, coupled with another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Night Vision, has enabled us to raise Communication Systems revenue guidance to an increase of 7% to 7.5% for the year versus the prior guidance of 5% to 7% and 3% to 5% when we started the year. 
In Electronic Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 10% for the quarter, with growth across all ES businesses, as the first half ADS-B headwind subsided. This strong growth was driven by long-term platforms like the F-35, the F-18 and F-16, which collectively grew more than 25%, as we leveraged technology upgrades, ramped production and expanded our international footprint. 
In Avionics, we continue to generate double-digit growth in weapons-release systems, even including F-35 growth, with new content awards and increase production of both domestic and international platforms. 
Segment order growth accelerated in the quarter to 56% for a book-to-bill of 1.4, and orders are now up 32% on a year-to-date basis. We booked more than $300 million in orders across F-35, F-18 and F-16 platforms, including a $184 million contract supplying electronic jammers to protect U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F-18 aircraft against electronic threats. Orders across the 3 platforms, F-35, F-18, F-16, have more than doubled this year to over $900 million and on track to hit $1 billion for the year. 
Overall for ES, solid third quarter results have mitigated the first half ADS-B impact, with year-to-date revenue now up 4% and a book-to-bill of 1, 3 resulting in a backlog increase of 21%. This, combined with an $18 billion opportunity pipeline and $4 billion of proposals outstanding, gives us confident that revenue will grow 4.5% to 5% this year and that the growth will accelerate in the medium term. 
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 1%, as Classified programs continued to grow mid-single digits from the ramp-up of smallsat, ground-based adjacency and space surveillance programs, offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. 
Order momentum also remained strong in the Classified area with additional customer funding for long-standing programs in new adjacencies. In addition, we were awarded an approximately $500 million multi-year contract to provide payloads for an exquisite classified space system, reflecting continued success in leveraging technology to not only expand as a full-mission solution partner in smallsat, but also to strengthen our position as a partner of choice on large exquisite platforms. 
I'm also pleased to note a few accomplishments that strengthened our competitive position on important missions. In the Environmental Solutions business, the launch of Nova's [ Go Deck ] satellited in early March included our second advanced baseline imager, or ABI, which approves fire detection and severe weather forecasting. This follows a successful launch of [ Go's R ] in November of 2016, which has provided unprecedented imagery of recent hurricanes, with 4x the resolution and 5x the download speed, providing forecasters with 30-second updates of the entire western hemisphere. Harris' ABIs are also on last 2 of [ Noah's ] latest generation of geostationary weather satellite, [ Go's T ] and [ Go's U ], with the entire constellation controlled by Harris' enterprise ground system. 
We continue to execute well on GPS, with a proven and reliable production cadence that included delivering a fifth GPS III navigation payload in early March, 26 days ahead of schedule. Strong execution along with a developed and fully tested 100% digital mission data unit positions us well for the upcoming GPS III 11-plus award. Year-to-date, Space and Intell revenue was up 1%, and orders were up 6%, resulting in a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Our pipeline has grown by 14% to $13 billion over the past year and with the recent successes of expanding into new adjacencies, we're confident this business can be a growth driver in the medium term. 
In summary, with our strong year-to-date performance, continued order momentum and an improved outlook on the back of a favorable GFY '18 budget resolution, we're tightening our fiscal '18 guidance and now expect revenue to be up approximately 4% from the previous guidance of 3% to 4%. This growth, combined with our strong operating performance, gives us confidence to tighten our EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.50 at the high end of the previous range and increase rate-free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $925 million. 
And with that to me, let me turn it over to Rahul."

As a reminder, statements today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. 
Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter with growth across all 3 segments. 
Operating income was up 7% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 30 basis points to 19.3%. 
EPS grew 21% and was up 12% excluding the benefit of Tax Reform. 
Adjusted free cash flow was [ $121 million ], as higher revenue in order momentum in the back end of the quarter resulted in $120 million increase of receivables and inventory, which will unwind in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date revenue was up 4%, and operating income was up 3%, despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was [ $451 million, ] a 10% increase over the prior year as we enter our strongest cash generation quarter. 
We have returned a total of about $400 million to shareholders, including approximately $200 million in share repurchases. In addition, we pre-funded the pension by $300 million in the third quarter. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was about $900 million. 
Turning to the third quarter's EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 21% or $0.29. Of this, $0.11 of EPS growth came from higher volume in Tactical radios, Avionics and Classified space, solid program execution and higher pension income. This was partially offset by lower environmental volume and increased R&D investment. Lower share count and reduced interest expense contributed $0.06. 
Lastly, a lower tax rate, including the benefit from Tax Reform, added $0.12 to EPS growth. 
Segment details on Slide 7. Communication Systems' third quarter revenue was $481 million, up 4% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in DoD Tactical, Night Vision, revenue was also up double digits, as the business continued to improve execution and increase its share of wallet with the Army. Operating income for this segment was up 5% to $147 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 30.6% on higher volume. 
Orders grew for the seventh straight quarter, up 20% with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strong bookings in Tactical, PSPC orders grew 28% on increased demand for legacy system upgrades from state and local agencies. 
Night Vision orders grew 10%, with continued momentum from the U.S. Army, and we received a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 6%, and operating income was up 8%. 
Operating margin of 29.6% was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date segment orders have increased 36% with a book-to-bill of 1.3 and a greater than 1 in all 3 businesses in this segment. Tactical, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems' revenue was $609 million, up 10% for the quarter. In addition to the growth in Avionics and Electronic Warfare that Bill mentioned, we saw solid revenue increase from the ramp of U.K. Robotics and UAE Battle Management programs. Segment operating income declined $3 million, [indiscernible] higher volume was more than offset by increased R&D investment and program revenue mix. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 4%, and operating margin was down to 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the net -- negative impact of the ADS-B program, R&D investment and program revenue mix. 
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence Systems, segment revenue was up 1%, and operating income was up 8%, as margins expanded 100 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 1% with continued growth in Classified programs offset by a decline in Environmental revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 17.7%. 
Moving to Slide 10 for full year guidance. As Bill indicated, given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up about 4% for the year, reflecting strength in DoD Tactical and Avionics. We're tightening the EPS guidance at the high end of the range to $6.45 to $6.50 from drop-through on higher volume. Tax rate is now 22.5% from 23% previously. The $0.04 benefit from lower tax rate will be offset by higher-than-expected share dilution and an increase in interest expense from the additional debt raised for pension-free funding. 
In Communication Systems, we are increasing the revenue guidance to be up 7% to 7.5% versus up 5% to 7% previously from improved DoD Tactical outlook and Night Vision readiness demand. In Electronic Systems, we're narrowing revenue guidance to the higher end of the range to be now up 4.5% to 5% versus up 4% to 5% previously, as strong orders in Avionics convert to revenue. 
In Space and Intelligence, we're narrowing the revenue guidance to be up approximately 0.5% versus flat to up 1% previously. For each segment, margins are still expected to be around the midpoint of the guidance ranges at about 30% in Communication Systems, 18.5% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence. 
We are increasing the adjusted free cash flow guidance from approximately $900 million to a range of $900 million to $925 million due to higher earnings. 
And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

Tactical radio budgets have increased by an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years compared with where they were this time last year.

As I mentioned in my remarks, Tactical radios is pretty good. We see addition aircraft quantities, and we're very encouraged about the trendline on the Intelligence budgets, including areas that we've been able to stake a position, like in smallsats. So we're very encouraged by that. At the beginning of the year, we set out a framework, which showed mid-single-digit growth across the medium term. And while we're not providing any guidance today, I see today being incrementally better than when we started the year. And if you see that in, sort of, the trendlines, based on what we've seen over the course of our fiscal '18. In CS, we started the year at 3% to 5%. We went to 5% to 7%. Now we're at the 7% to 7.5% range. DoD Tactical, we started the beginning of the year at mid-teens. We went to 20% growth year-over-year. Now we're about 30%. We're seeing much greater traction in the Electronic Warfare and Avionics segments. So when I sit and look at it, it feels better incrementally than it did before, so maybe mid-single digits plus in '19 and beyond. Clearly, the CS segment, we said was, at the time, I think, mid-single digits is probably mid to high. I think Electronic Systems with mid-to high, and it's probably at the high end of that. And I would say, also on the Space and Intel business, which, we were thinking, was low to mid-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year, feels closer to mid-single-digit growth, principally because of getting the traction in smallsats as well as the very significant win that we recently received in -- on an exquisite payload. So that all is also very encouraging, and I see as being a bit incrementally better in '19 and beyond than we thought at the beginning of the year."

So we're very tightly linked with them. As you know, they -- they've decided to separate the decisions around the upper tactical network, which is around WIN-T. We've got a radio and a waveform that's positioned there from the lower tactical, which is around the radios. And I'm very pleased to see them moving forward and placing orders for the Manpack.

Harris -- even within Harris, we've got some shorter-cycle and some longer-cycle businesses. But I think, overall, it's going to be positive. The budget trends are clearly up, at least for the next several years. It all depends on how fast the appropriations get slowed down into contracts and awarded to companies, and how fast they can execute on it. So there's lots of dimensions here that are going to drive top line growth, including making sure that all of the things you need to provide to satisfy that contract, the supply chain, your own asset structure, your own employment, all needs to adapt to a much better budgeted environment. But I think, overall, it's clearly a positive sign, and most companies, including Harris, will be up in the mid-single digit plus range, '19 and beyond."

Iraq is a very big, important opportunity, it's well funded. There's lots of opportunities for us to grow in Iraq. We see opportunities in Kuwait, some opportunities evolving in Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, especially as we continue to execute well on the MRAD Land Tactical system, the network system that we're installing there, which is going to be going through an IOC very, very soon, hitting a key milestone. So we see good opportunities continuing in the Middle East. Europe is about 20%, more or less, of the pipeline. Again, we've -- we continue to see opportunities in the Ukraine. That looks fairly, fairly good as well as other NATO countries. And we're starting to see more opportunities in Western Europe evolve in Europe as well. In Asia, that's about 10% of the pipeline. So Australia is a key part of what we're executing there. That $260 million systems opportunity is going well. It's about that revenue opportunity in fiscal '18. It'll grow in '19 and '20, as we continue to work and complete that program. It's going well so far with the front end bu t going well. But there is a lot of follow-on opportunities in Australia as we execute well on that particular program. So I'm very encouraged with what's happening in the Asia-Pacific region. And importantly, as we develop more and more credibility around installing network systems, which is a much bigger market for us, and I went through a couple of examples of what we've done in the past and what were working on today, including another opportunity in the Southeast Asian country that was just awarded to us in terms of a systems modernization that builds on a legacy installed base. So those are the major opportunities. Central Latin America is about 10% of the pipeline. It depends on what we see happening in Colombia, Mexico. Last year was very a very good year for Mexico. This year is a bit softer. But we do expect to see -- continue to see recapitalizations there. And in Central Asia, which is Afghanistan, Pakistan, is a small piece of the pipeline, very small piece of our revenue this year. It could start to grow over time. I'm not looking at that being a growth market for us in fiscal '19. So maybe that's a little bit of color on the international side."

That's been a proven strategy end, works very, very well that we've got a very high share on the international markets we play. And we laid out a very clear strategy to investment taking a solid base and opening up the addressable markets. So going more into Network Systems. So where we have the radio, packaging systems around that to make it easier to use and more intelligent for the end users like Australia, like we've done in the UAE and other places. As well as get a systems opportunity and markets may be where we don't have the incumbent radio position and use that as a way to go in and pull the radio that may be with another competitor into Harris. So that's been a clear direction that we been on as well as take our great position on ground radios into the airborne side and clearly, the -- our 201 product from the Exelis allows us to go into that particular market as well as airborne ISR. And again, it's a very win that we just received in the last week, this $130 million IDIQ, I think, is testament to the capabilities that we have across these different domains. And Carter, these are areas that we've been investing in IRAD in over the last couple of years. So I don't see a big step-up here from here to go and penetrate these domains to see a continuation of the investments that we have been making. The other thing that we've talked quite a bit about is some of the adjacencies that we're attacking in the intelligence community. We've talked about moving for over time from being a component supplier to supplying subsystems to now supplying complete end-to-end mission solutions, like we've done on smallsat. That has been a significant investment on our part. The -- our IRAD investment in our Space and Intelligence business has crept up over time. And it really going after those kinds of opportunities. Winning this $0.5 billion exquisite system that we just won in the last couple of weeks, which is -- which really shows the power of the model we have in our Space Intelligence business to both go after new end-to-end mission solutions as a prime but also, be the partner of choice for components and subsystems for large exquisite. So I think this balance is working very, very well for us. And as I see, going forward, I see our IRAD in the same range we're today as a percentage of revenue could tick up a little bit but not materially."

Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis",1425,"Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance, with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first 3 quarters up 17% on 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow. 
The highlight, again, this quarter and for the year is our strong quarter momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year. 
So let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4. Communication Systems revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and night vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter, with revenue up 48%, as the focus on readiness continued to drive growth across the services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communicating equipment to software-defined radios. This sustained readiness in demand has driven a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year. 
International Tactical revenue was down 12%, as expected, on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 '17 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of these Australian modernization program in the Asia-Pacific region. Strong orders growth of 15% for the quarter and 36% year-to-date have nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect international will be flat to slightly down. 
As we've been communicating, our tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain international leadership and expand our addressable market into network systems, ISR and airborne. And we continue to execute well against this strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the omnibus bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY '18, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY '18 president's budget request. We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter and earlier this week, we received an LRIP delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. 
On the Army 2-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon with an award anticipated sometime this summer. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we delivered additional test radios during the quarter, and we'll ramp production in the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal '19. 
Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leveraged our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade the military communications network. This builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness. 
And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a 5-year, $130 million sole-source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link device to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win against the incumbent helps us increase our share wallet of ground devices and positions us well to grow in the airborne ISR segment going forward. 
Overall, for the first 3 quarters, tactical revenue increased 7%, with a book-to-bill of 1.4, resulting in a 74% year-over-year backlog increase to $880 million. This growth in tactical, coupled with another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Night Vision, has enabled us to raise Communication Systems revenue guidance to an increase of 7% to 7.5% for the year versus the prior guidance of 5% to 7% and 3% to 5% when we started the year. 
In Electronic Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 10% for the quarter, with growth across all ES businesses, as the first half ADS-B headwind subsided. This strong growth was driven by long-term platforms like the F-35, the F-18 and F-16, which collectively grew more than 25%, as we leveraged technology upgrades, ramped production and expanded our international footprint.  
In Avionics, we continue to generate double-digit growth in weapons release systems, even excluding F-35 growth, with new content awards and increased production of both domestic and international platforms.  Segment order growth accelerated in the quarter to 56% for a book-to-bill of 1.4, and orders are now up 32% on a year-to-date basis. We booked more than $300 million in orders across F-35, F-18 and F-16 platforms, including a $184 million contract supplying electronic jammers to protect U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F-18 aircraft against electronic threats. Orders across the 3 platforms, F-35, F-18, F-16, have more than doubled this year to over $900 million and are on track to hit $1 billion for the year. 
Overall for ES, solid third quarter results have mitigated the first half ADS-B impact, with year-to-date revenue now up 4% and a book-to-bill of 1.3, resulting in a backlog increase of 21%. This, combined with an $18 billion opportunity pipeline and $4 billion of proposals outstanding, gives us confident that revenue will grow 4.5% to 5% this year and that the growth will accelerate in the medium term. 
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 1%, as Classified programs continued to grow mid-single digits from the ramp-up of smallsat, ground-based adjacency and space surveillance programs, offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. 
Order momentum also remained strong in the Classified area with additional customer funding for long-standing programs in new adjacencies. In addition, we were awarded an approximately $500 million multiyear contract to provide payloads for an exquisite classified space system, reflecting continued success in leveraging technology to not only expand as a full-mission solution partner in smallsats, but also to strengthen our position as a partner of choice on large exquisite platforms. 
I'm also pleased to note a few accomplishments that strengthened our competitive position on important missions. 
In the Environmental Solutions business, the launch of NOAA's GOES-S satellite in early March included our second advanced baseline imager, or ABI, which improves fire detection and severe weather forecasting. This follows a successful launch of GOES-R in November of 2016, which has provided unprecedented imagery of recent hurricanes, with 4x the resolution and 5x the download speed, providing forecasters with 30-second updates of the entire Western Hemisphere. Harris' ABIs are also on last 2 of NOAA's latest generation of geostationary weather satellites, GOES-T and GOES-U, with the entire constellation controlled by Harris' enterprise ground system. 
We continue to execute well on GPS, with a proven and reliable production cadence that included delivering a fifth GPS III navigation payload in early March, 26 days ahead of schedule. Strong execution along with a developed and fully tested 100% digital mission data unit positions us well for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award. Year-to-date, Space and Intel revenue was up 1%, and orders were up 6%, resulting in a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Our pipeline has grown by 14% to $13 billion over the past year and with the recent successes of expanding into new adjacencies, we're confident this business can be a growth driver in the medium term. 
In summary, with our strong year-to-date performance, continued order momentum and an improved outlook on the back of a favorable GFY '18 budget resolution, we're tightening our fiscal '18 guidance and now expect revenue to be up approximately 4% from the previous guidance of 3% to 4%. This growth, combined with our strong operating performance, gives us confidence to tighten our EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.50 at the high end of the previous range and increase free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $925 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

As a reminder, statements today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. 
Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter with growth across all 3 segments. 
Operating income was up 7% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 30 basis points to 19.3%. 
EPS grew 21% and was up 12% excluding the benefit of tax reform. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $121 million, as higher revenues and order momentum in the back-end of the quarter resulted in $120 million increase of receivables and inventory, which will unwind in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date revenue was up 4%, and operating income was up 3%, despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $451 million, a 10% increase over the prior year as we enter our strongest cash-generation quarter. 
We have returned a total of about $400 million to shareholders, including approximately $200 million in share repurchases. In addition, we prefunded the pension by $300 million in the third quarter. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was about $900 million. 
Turning to the third quarter EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 21% or $0.29. Of this, $0.11 of EPS growth came from higher volume in Tactical radios, Avionics and Classified space, solid program execution and higher pension income. This was partially offset by lower environmental volume and increased R&D investment. Lower share count and reduced interest expense contributed $0.06. 
Lastly, a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform, added $0.12 to EPS growth. 
Segment details on Slide 7. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $481 million, up 4% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in DoD Tactical, Night Vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continued to improve execution and increase its share of wallet with the Army. Operating income for the segment was up 5% to $147 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 30.6% on higher volume. 
Orders grew for the seventh straight quarter, up 20% with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strong bookings in Tactical, PSPC orders grew 28% on increased demand for legacy system upgrades from state and local agencies. 
Night Vision orders grew 10%, with continued momentum from the U.S. Army, and we received a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 6%, and operating income was up 8%. 
Operating margin of 29.6% was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date segment orders have increased 36% with a book-to-bill of 1.3 and it's greater than 1 in all 3 businesses in this segment: tactical, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $609 million, up 10% for the quarter. In addition to the growth in Avionics and electronic warfare, that Bill mentioned, we saw solid revenue increase from the ramp of U.K. robotics and UAE battle management programs. Segment operating income declined $3 million and higher volume was more than offset by increased R&D investment and program revenue mix. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 4%, and operating margin was down to 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program, R&D investment and program revenue mix. 
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence Systems, segment revenue was up 1%, and operating income was up 8%, as margins expanded 100 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 1% with continued growth in Classified programs offset by a decline in environmental revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 17.7%. 
Moving to Slide 10 for full year guidance. As Bill indicated, given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up about 4% for the year, reflecting strength in DoD Tactical and Avionics. We're tightening the EPS guidance at the high end of the range to $6.45 to $6.50 from drop-through on higher volume. Tax rate guidance is now 22.5% from 23% previously. The $0.04 benefit from lower tax rate will be offset by higher-than-expected share dilution and an increase in interest expense from the additional debt raised for pension-free funding. 
In Communication Systems, we are increasing the revenue guidance to be up 7% to 7.5% versus up 5% to 7% previously from improved DoD Tactical outlook and Night Vision readiness demand. In Electronic Systems, we're narrowing revenue guidance to the higher end of the range to be now up 4.5% to 5% versus up 4% to 5% previously, as strong orders in Avionics convert to revenue. 
In Space and Intelligence, we're narrowing the revenue guidance to be up approximately 0.5% versus flat to up 1% previously. For each segment, margins are still expected to be around the midpoint of the guidance ranges at about 30% in Communication Systems, 18.5% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence. 
We are increasing the adjusted free cash flow guidance from approximately $900 million to a range of $900 million to $925 million due to higher earnings. 
And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

We're now in the innings of fiscal '18, and we feel good about our year-to-date results and our expectations for the balance of the year. The passage of the GFY '18 omnibus bill and the trend line in the President's budget in '19 and beyond are real positives for Harris and the programs we support, especially in strategic growth areas where we've invested in R&D over the past several years and have strong customer positions. 
Tactical radio budgets have increased by an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years compared with where they were this time last year. F-35 and F-18 aircraft quantities have been increased, Classified space and other IC budgets are trending up, and the FA programs are well funded. Overall, our bid and proposal activity remains high, our win rates are solid, and our order rates -- our orders in backlog continue to grow, setting us up for accelerating growth in '19 and in the medium term, as we execute against our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

As I mentioned in my remarks, Tactical radios is pretty good. We see addition aircraft quantities, and we're very encouraged about the trend line on the intelligence budgets, including areas that we've been able to stake a position, like in smallsats. So we're very encouraged by that. At the beginning of the year, we set out a framework, which showed mid-single-digit growth across the medium term. And while we're not providing any guidance today, I see it today being incrementally better than when we started the year. And you can see that in, sort of, the trend lines, based on what we've seen over the course of our fiscal '18. In CS, we started the year at 3% to 5%, we went to 5% to 7%, now we're at the 7% to 7.5% range. DoD Tactical, we started the beginning of the year at mid-teens, we went to 20% growth year-over-year, now we're about 30%. We're seeing much greater traction in the electronic warfare and Avionics segments. So when I sit and look at it, it feels better incrementally than it did before, so maybe mid-single digits plus in '19 and beyond. Clearly, the CS segment, we said was, at the time, I think, mid-single digits is probably mid to high. I think Electronic Systems was mid to high, and it's probably at the high end of that. And I would say, also on the Space and Intel business, which, we were thinking, was low- to mid-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year, feels closer to mid-single-digit growth, principally because of getting the traction in smallsats as well as the very significant win that we recently received in the -- on an exquisite payload. So that all is also very encouraging, and I see it's being a bit incrementally better in '19 and beyond than we thought at the beginning of the year."

However, we did make a voluntary contribution of $300 million to our pension fund that will generate 7 3/4% rate of return, and it should also reduce our PBGC premiums. So while the increase in rates will be a headwind, we should be able to manage through that, and the benefits of incremental contributions will more than offset it. But it will all depend on where the rates are as of June 30, but we don't see any year-over-year change in our pension income at this point."

There's fixed investment modernization priorities or 8 CFTs, or cross-functional teams, one of which is on the Army network. We're very closely linked to them. They've been to our facilities. We have detailed conversations with them, and they help us think through how we can invest our IRAD spend, both on radio, but probably more importantly, on next-generation waveforms that are low probabilty of intercept, low probability of detection, anti-jam waveforms that can operate effectively in contested environment. So we're very tightly linked with them. As you know, they've decided to separate the decisions around the upper tactical network, which is around WIN-T. We've got a radio and a waveform that's positioned there from the lower tactical, which is around the radios. And I'm very pleased to see them moving forward and placing orders for the Manpack. They're moving forward on the handheld. I think it's all very, very encouraging. So one way of saying we're very tightly connected. And I think we continue to adjust and adapt our strategy and our investments, given where the Army happens to be moving."

Harris -- even within Harris, we've got some shorter-cycle and some longer-cycle businesses. But I think, overall, it's going to be positive. The budget trends are clearly up, at least for the next several years. It all depends on how fast the appropriations get flowed down into contracts and awarded to companies, and how fast they can execute on it. So there's lots of dimensions here that are going to drive top line growth, including making sure that all of the things you need to provide to satisfy that contract, the supply chain, your own asset structure, your own employment, all needs to adapt to a much better budget environment. But I think, overall, it's clearly a positive sign, and most companies, including Harris, will be up in the mid-single digit plus range, '19 and beyond."

And that's going to come from increased volume and some mix shift of product. So we feel good about the approximately 30% that we've kind of guided to this year. Now going forward, there are a few things that will drive CS margins. But overall, we feel that we can see around the 30% range. The -- there should be benefit from higher volume and as that drops through to the factory. But the modernization products are coming with slightly lower margin, and there's -- all the systems wins that we're getting, they also typically come in at less than the product gross margins.

We've done well so far but there's incremental opportunity. So it's not going to be -- we're not going to see another 6-day reduction.

So we're starting to see that flow through in the order rates in the revenue in Avionics and electronic warfare. And I would expect, as we continue to invest, that we've stepped up very recently again, even from where we were before in investments in these areas. And I think that will help us in '19 and beyond. There's some -- also some franchise we're investing in. That includes robotics. We've seen some -- a very important win.

What we have seen this year different than last year in the prior years is less lumpiness. It's more level loaded and even loaded across the quarters, which is good. We always see Q4 being a bit stronger than the others but a little more even loaded. Our pipeline -- despite the good order rate that we've seen so far this year, our pipeline remains very robust at about $2.3 billion. It's about the same as it's been every quarter over the last year practically. So even though the orders are coming up, the pipeline is replenishing itself relatively quickly, and we feel good about the position that we happen to have. So I think we'll deliver Q4.

And there'll be incremental benefit from increased earning. So there's a clear line of sight to getting to $1 billion by '19.

So the International Tactical pipeline is around $2.3 billion and again, it's about where it's been over the last number of quarters. And I think it's good news that despite the orders, it's holding relatively stable. The -- about 55% of that is in Middle East and Africa, and that's a little higher than it was last quarter, so we continue to see opportunities flowing into the pipeline in the Middle East, as we've talked about Iraq in the past. Iraq is a very big, important opportunity, it's well funded. There's lots of opportunities for us to grow in Iraq. We see opportunities in Kuwait, some opportunities evolving in the Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, especially as we continue to execute well on the Emirati Land Tactical system, the network system that we're installing there, which is going to be going through an IOC very, very soon, hitting a key milestone. So we see good opportunities continuing in the Middle East. Europe is about 20%, more or less, of the pipeline. Again, we've -- we continue to see opportunities in the Ukraine. That looks fairly, fairly good as well as other NATO countries. And we're starting to see more opportunities in Western Europe evolve in Europe as well. In Asia, that's about 10% of the pipeline. So Australia is a key part of what we're executing there. That $260 million systems opportunity is going well. It's about that revenue opportunity in fiscal '18. It'll grow in '19 and '20, as we continue to work and complete that program. It's going well so far with the front end but going well. But there is a lot of follow-on opportunities in Australia as we execute well on that particular program. So I'm very encouraged about what's happening in the Asia-Pacific region. And importantly, as we develop more and more credibility around installing network systems, which is a much bigger market for us, and I went through a couple of the examples of what we've done in the past and what we're working on today, including another opportunity in a Southeast Asian country that was just awarded to us in terms of a systems modernization that builds on a legacy installed base. So those are the big major opportunities. Central Latin America is about 10% of the pipeline. It depends on what we see happening in Colombia and Mexico. Last year was very a very good year for Mexico. This year is a bit softer. But we do expect to see -- continue to see recapitalizations there. And then Central Asia, which is Afghanistan, Pakistan, was a small piece of the pipeline, very small piece of our revenue this year. It could start to grow over time. I'm not looking at that being a growth market for us in fiscal '19. So maybe that's a little bit of color on the international side."

We -- when the market was really soft, we executed on the Exelis transaction. We integrated very, very well. And I think it's positioned us -- helped us reshape the portfolio as well. So sitting here today, we're going to generate a lot of cash in the next couple of years, sort of north of $2 billion of cash in the next few years.

So it leaves a lot of capacity for either M&A or to buy back our stock, as we continue to see value in our stock, both this quarter as well as going into next year.

That's been a proven strategy, it's worked very, very well and that's why we've got a very high share even at the international markets we play in, where they're not restricted markets. And we laid out a very clear strategy to investors of taking that solid base and opening up the addressable markets. So going more into network systems. So where we have the radio, packaging systems around that to make it easier to use and more intelligent for the end users like Australia, like we've done in the UAE and other places as well as get a systems opportunity in markets where maybe we don't have the incumbent radio position and use that as a way to go in and pull the radio that maybe with another competitor into Harris. So that's been a clear direction that we've been on as well as take our great position on ground radios into the airborne side and clearly, the ARC-201 product from the Exelis allows us to go into that particular market as well as airborne ISR. And again, this is a very important win that we just received in the last week, this $130 million IDIQ, I think, is testament to the capabilities that we have across these different domains. And Carter, these are areas that we've been investing in IRAD in over the last couple of years. So I don't see a big step-up from here to go and penetrate these domains. I see it as a continuation of the investments we have been making. The other thing we've talked quite a bit about is some of the adjacencies that we're attacking in the intelligence community. We've talked about moving for over time from being a component supplier to supplying subsystems to now supplying complete end-to-end mission solutions, like we've done on smallsat. That has been a significant investment on our part. The -- our IRAD investment in our Space and Intelligence business has crept up over time. And it really is going after those kinds of opportunities. Winning this $0.5 billion exquisite system that we just won in the last couple of weeks, which is -- which really shows the power of the model we have in our Space and Intelligence business to both go after new end-to-end mission solutions as a prime but also be the partner of choice for components and subsystems for large exquisite systems. So I think this balance is working very, very well for us. And as I see, going forward, I see our IRAD in the same range we're in today as a percentage of revenue could tick up a little bit but not materially."

Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis",1425,"Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance, with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first 3 quarters up 17% on 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow. 
The highlight, again, this quarter and for the year is our strong quarter momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year. 
So let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments, noted on Slide 4. Communication Systems revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Night Vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter, with revenue up 48%, as the focus on readiness continued to drive growth across the services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communication equipment to software-defined radios. This sustained readiness demand has driven a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year. 
International Tactical revenue was down 12%, as expected, on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 '17 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of the Australian modernization program in the Asia-Pacific region. Strong orders growth of 15% for the quarter and 36% year-to-date have nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect International will be flat to slightly down. 
As we've been communicating, our Tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain international leadership and expand our addressable market into network systems, ISR and airborne. And we continue to execute well against this strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the omnibus bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY '18, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY '18 president's budget request. We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter, and earlier this week, we received an LRIP delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. 
On the Army 2-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon, with an award anticipated sometime this summer. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we delivered additional test radios during the quarter, and we'll ramp production in the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal '19. 
Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leveraged our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade the military communications network. This builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness. 
And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a 5-year, $130 million sole-source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link device to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win against the incumbent helps us increase our share of wallet of ground devices and positions us well to grow in the airborne ISR segment going forward. 
Overall, for the first 3 quarters, Tactical revenue increased 7%, with a book-to-bill of 1.4, resulting in a 74% year-over-year backlog increase to $880 million. This growth in Tactical, coupled with another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Night Vision, has enabled us to raise Communication Systems revenue guidance to an increase of 7% to 7.5% for the year versus the prior guidance of 5% to 7% and 3% to 5% when we started the year. 
In Electronic Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 10% for the quarter, with growth across all ES businesses as the first half ADS-B headwind subsided. This strong growth was driven by long-term platforms like the F-35, the F-18 and F-16, which collectively grew more than 25% as we leveraged technology upgrades, ramped production and expanded our international footprint.  
In Avionics, we continue to generate double-digit growth in weapons release systems, even excluding F-35 growth, with new content awards and increased production of both domestic and international platforms.  Segment order growth accelerated in the quarter to 56% for a book-to-bill of 1.4, and orders are now up 32% on a year-to-date basis. We booked more than $300 million in orders across F-35, F-18 and F-16 platforms, including a $184 million contract supplying electronic jammers to protect U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F-18 aircraft against electronic threats. Orders across the 3 platforms, F-35, F-18, F-16, have more than doubled this year to over $900 million and are on track to hit $1 billion for the year. 
Overall for ES, solid third quarter results have mitigated the first half ADS-B impact, with year-to-date revenue now up 4% and a book-to-bill of 1.3, resulting in a backlog increase of 21%. This, combined with an $18 billion opportunity pipeline and $4 billion of proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will grow 4.5% to 5% this year and that the growth will accelerate in the medium term. 
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 1%, as Classified programs continued to grow mid-single digits from the ramp-up of smallsat, ground-based adjacency and space surveillance programs, offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. 
Order momentum also remained strong in the Classified area with additional customer funding for long-standing programs in new adjacencies. In addition, we were awarded an approximately $500 million multiyear contract to provide payloads for an exquisite classified space system, reflecting continued success in leveraging technology to not only expand as a full-mission solution partner in smallsats, but also to strengthen our position as a partner of choice on large exquisite platforms. 
I'm also pleased to note a few accomplishments that strengthened our competitive position on important missions. 
In the Environmental Solutions business, the launch of NOAA's GOES-S satellite in early March included our second advanced baseline imager, or ABI, which improves fire detection and severe weather forecasting. This follows a successful launch of GOES-R in November of 2016, which has provided unprecedented imagery of recent hurricanes, with 4x the resolution and 5x the download speed, providing forecasters with 30-second updates of the entire Western Hemisphere. Harris ABIs are also on last 2 of NOAA's latest generation of geostationary weather satellites, GOES-T and GOES-U, with the entire constellation controlled by Harris' enterprise ground system. 
We continue to execute well on GPS, with a proven and reliable production cadence that included delivering a fifth GPS III navigation payload in early March, 26 days ahead of schedule. Strong execution along with a developed and fully tested 100% digital mission data unit positions us well for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award. Year-to-date, Space and Intel revenue was up 1%, and orders were up 6%, resulting in a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Our pipeline has grown by 14% to $13 billion over the past year, and with the recent successes of expanding into new adjacencies, we're confident this business can be a growth driver in the medium term. 
In summary, with our strong year-to-date performance, continued order momentum and an improved outlook on the back of a favorable GFY '18 budget resolution, we're tightening our fiscal '18 guidance and now expect revenue to be up approximately 4% from the previous guidance of 3% to 4%. This growth, combined with our strong operating performance, gives us confidence to tighten our EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.50 at the high end of the previous range and increase free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $925 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, statements today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter with growth across all 3 segment",902,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, statements today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. 
Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter with growth across all 3 segments. 
Operating income was up 7% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 30 basis points to 19.3%. 
EPS grew 21% and was up 12% excluding the benefit of tax reform. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $121 million, as higher revenues and order momentum in the back end of the quarter resulted in a $120 million increase of receivables and inventory, which will unwind in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date revenue was up 4%, and operating income was up 3%, despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $451 million, a 10% increase over the prior year as we enter our strongest cash-generation quarter. 
We have returned a total of about $400 million to shareholders, including approximately $200 million in share repurchases. In addition, we prefunded the pension by $300 million in the third quarter. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was about $900 million. 
Turning to the third quarter EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 21% or $0.29. Of this, $0.11 of EPS growth came from higher volume in Tactical radios, Avionics and Classified space, solid program execution and higher pension income. This was partially offset by lower environmental volume and increased R&D investment. Lower share count and reduced interest expense contributed $0.06. 
Lastly, a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform, added $0.12 to EPS growth. 
Segment details on Slide 7. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $481 million, up 4% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in DoD Tactical, Night Vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continued to improve execution and increase its share of wallet with the Army. Operating income for the segment was up 5% to $147 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 30.6% on higher volume. 
Orders grew for the seventh straight quarter, up 20% with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strong bookings in Tactical, PSPC orders grew 28% on increased demand for legacy system upgrades from state and local agencies. 
Night Vision orders grew 10%, with continued momentum from the U.S. Army, and we received a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 6%, and operating income was up 8%. 
Operating margin of 29.6% was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date segment orders have increased 36% with a book-to-bill of 1.3, and it's greater than 1 in all 3 businesses in this segment: Tactical, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $609 million, up 10% for the quarter. In addition to the growth in Avionics and electronic warfare that Bill mentioned, we saw a solid revenue increase from the ramp of U.K. robotics and UAE battle management programs. Segment operating income declined $3 million and higher volume was more than offset by increased R&D investment and program revenue mix. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 4%, and operating margin was down to 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program, R&D investment and program revenue mix. 
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence Systems, segment revenue was up 1% and operating income was up 8%, as margins expanded 100 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 1%, with continued growth in Classified programs offset by a decline in environmental revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 17.7%. 
Moving to Slide 10 for full year guidance. As Bill indicated, given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up about 4% for the year, reflecting strength in DoD Tactical and Avionics. We're tightening the EPS guidance at the high end of the range to $6.45 to $6.50 from drop-through on higher volume. Tax rate guidance is now 22.5% from 23% previously. The $0.04 benefit from lower tax rate will be offset by higher-than-expected share dilution and an increase in interest expense from the additional debt raised for pension prefunding. 
In Communication Systems, we are increasing the revenue guidance to be up 7% to 7.5% versus up 5% to 7% previously from improved DoD Tactical outlook and Night Vision readiness demand. In Electronic Systems, we're narrowing revenue guidance to the higher end of the range to be now up 4.5% to 5% versus up 4% to 5% previously, as strong orders in Avionics convert to revenue. 
In Space and Intelligence, we're narrowing the revenue guidance to be up approximately 0.5% versus flat to up 1% previously. For each segment, margins are still expected to be around the midpoint of the guidance ranges at about 30% in Communication Systems, 18.5% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence. 
We are increasing the adjusted free cash flow guidance from approximately $900 million to a range of $900 million to $925 million due to higher earnings. 
And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

The passage of the GFY '18 omnibus bill and the trend line of the President's budget in '19 and beyond are real positives for Harris and the programs we support, especially in strategic growth areas where we've invested in R&D over the past several years and have strong customer positions. 
Tactical radio budgets have increased by an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years compared with where they were this time last year. F-35 and F-18 aircraft quantities have been increased, Classified space and other IC budgets are trending up, and the FA programs are well funded. Overall, our bid and proposal activity remains high, our win rates are solid, and our order rates -- our orders in backlog continue to grow, setting us up for accelerating growth in '19 and in the medium term as we execute against our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder value.

As I mentioned in my remarks, Tactical radio is pretty good. We see additional aircraft quantities, and we're very encouraged about the trend line on the intelligence budgets, including areas that we've been able to stake a position, like in smallsats. So we're very encouraged by that. At the beginning of the year, we set out a framework which showed mid-single-digit growth across the medium term. And while we're not providing any guidance today, I see it today being incrementally better than when we started the year. And you can see that in sort of the trend lines, based on what we've seen over the course of our fiscal '18. In CS, we started the year at 3% to 5%, we went to 5% to 7%, now we're in the 7% to 7.5% range. DoD Tactical, we started the beginning of the year at mid-teens, we went to 20% growth year-over-year, now we're about 30%. We're seeing much greater traction in the electronic warfare and Avionics segments. So when I sit and look at it, it feels better incrementally than it did before, so maybe mid-single digits plus in '19 and beyond. Clearly, the CS segment, we said was, at the time, I think, mid-single digits. It's probably mid to high. I think Electronic Systems was mid to high, and it's probably at the high end of that. And I would say, also on the Space and Intel business, which we were thinking was low- to mid-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year, feels closer to mid-single-digit growth, principally because of getting the traction in smallsats as well as the very significant win that we recently received in the -- on an exquisite payload. So that all is very encouraging, and I see us being a bit incrementally better in '19 and beyond than we thought at the beginning of the year."

We're very closely linked to them. They've been to our facilities. We have detailed conversations with them, and they help us think through how we can invest our IRAD spend, both on radio, but probably more importantly, on next-generation waveforms that are low probability of intercept, low probability of detection, anti-jam waveforms that can operate effectively in contested environments. So we're very tightly linked with them. As you know, they've decided to separate the decisions around the upper tactical network, which is around WIN-T -- we've got a radio and a waveform that's positioned there -- from the lower tactical, which is around the radios. And I'm very pleased to see them moving forward and placing orders for the Manpack. They're moving forward on the handheld. I think it's all very, very encouraging.

So we feel good about the approximately 30% that we've kind of guided to this year. Now going forward, there are a few things that will drive CS margins. But overall, we feel that we can stay around the 30% range. The -- there should be benefit from higher volume and as that drops through to the factory. But the modernization products are coming with slightly lower margin, and there's -- all the systems wins that we're getting, they also typically come in at less than the product gross margins.

We always see Q4 being a bit stronger than the others but a little more even loaded. Our pipeline -- despite the good order rate that we've seen so far this year, our pipeline remains very robust at about $2.3 billion.

The -- about 55% of that is in Middle East and Africa, and that's a little higher than it was last quarter, so we continue to see opportunities flowing into the pipeline in the Middle East, as we've talked about Iraq in the past. Iraq is a very big, important opportunity, it's well funded. There's lots of opportunities for us to grow in Iraq. We see opportunities in Kuwait, some opportunities evolving in the Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, especially as we continue to execute well on the Emirati Land Tactical system, the network system that we're installing there, which is going to be going through an IOC very, very soon, hitting a key milestone. So we see good opportunities continuing in the Middle East. Europe is about 20%, more or less, of the pipeline. Again, we've -- we continue to see opportunities in the Ukraine. That looks fairly, fairly good as well as other NATO countries. And we're starting to see more opportunities in Western Europe evolve in Europe as well. In Asia, that's about 10% of the pipeline. So Australia is a key part of what we're executing there. That $260 million systems opportunity is going well. It's about that revenue opportunity in fiscal '18. It'll grow in '19 and '20 as we continue to work and complete that program. It's going well so far with the front end but going well. But there is a lot of follow-on opportunities in Australia as we execute well on that particular program. So I'm very encouraged about what's happening in the Asia-Pacific region. And importantly, as we develop more and more credibility around installing network systems, which is a much bigger market for us -- and I went through a couple of the examples of what we've done in the past and what we're working on today, including another opportunity in a Southeast Asian country that was just awarded to us in terms of a systems modernization that builds on a legacy installed base. So those are the big major opportunities. Central and Latin America is about 10% of the pipeline. It depends on what we see happening in Colombia and Mexico. Last year was very a very good year for Mexico. This year is a bit softer. But we do expect to see -- continue to see recapitalizations there. And then Central Asia, which is Afghanistan, Pakistan, was a small piece of the pipeline, very small piece of our revenue this year. It could start to grow over time. I'm not looking at that being a growth market for us in fiscal '19. So maybe that's a little bit of color on the international side."

So that's been a clear direction that we've been on, as well as take our great position on ground radios into the airborne side. And clearly, the ARC-201 product from the Exelis allows us to go into that particular market, as well as airborne ISR. And again, this is a very important win that we just received in the last week. This $130 million IDIQ, I think, is testament to the capabilities that we have across these different domains. And Carter, these are areas that we've been investing in IRAD in over the last couple of years. So I don't see a big step-up from here to go and penetrate these domains. I see it as a continuation of the investments we have been making. The other thing we've talked quite a bit about is some of the adjacencies that we're attacking in the intelligence community. We've talked about moving over time from being a component supplier to supplying subsystems to now supplying complete end-to-end mission solutions, like we've done on smallsat. That has been a significant investment on our part. The -- our IRAD investment in our Space and Intelligence business has crept up over time. And it really is going after those kinds of opportunities. Winning this $0.5 billion exquisite system that we just won in the last couple of weeks, which is -- which really shows the power of the model we have in our Space and Intelligence business to both go after new end-to-end mission solutions as a prime but also be the partner of choice for components and subsystems for large exquisite systems. So I think this balance is working very, very well for us. And as I see, going forward, I see our IRAD in the same range we're in today as a percentage of revenue. Could tick up a little bit but not materially."

And when you look at the performance of the company, we're more than 99.5% on time for over 1 million components that we delivered to date on F-35, so we're a very good supplier there. We've reduced cost by more than 2/3 from the first ship set on F-35. So I think we've demonstrated capability and willingness to work hard to take -- continue to take cost out.

Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis",1425,"Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments, and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance, with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first 3 quarters up 17% on 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow. 
The highlight, again, this quarter and for the year is our strong quarter momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year. 
So let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments, noted on Slide 4. Communication Systems revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Night Vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter, with revenue up 48%, as the focus on readiness continued to drive growth across the services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communication equipment to software-defined radios. This sustained readiness demand has driven a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year. 
International Tactical revenue was down 12%, as expected, on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 '17 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of the Australian modernization program in the Asia-Pacific region. Strong orders growth of 15% for the quarter and 36% year-to-date have nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect International will be flat to slightly down. 
As we've been communicating, our Tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain international leadership and expand our addressable market into network systems, ISR and airborne. And we continue to execute well against this strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the omnibus bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY '18, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY '18 president's budget request. We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter, and earlier this week, we received an LRIP delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. 
On the Army 2-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon, with an award anticipated sometime this summer. 
For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, we delivered additional test radios during the quarter, and we'll ramp production in the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal '19. 
Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leveraged our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade the military communications network. This builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness. 
And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a 5-year, $130 million sole-source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link device to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win against the incumbent helps us increase our share of wallet of ground devices and positions us well to grow in the airborne ISR segment going forward. 
Overall, for the first 3 quarters, Tactical revenue increased 7%, with a book-to-bill of 1.4, resulting in a 74% year-over-year backlog increase to $880 million. This growth in Tactical, coupled with another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Night Vision, has enabled us to raise Communication Systems revenue guidance to an increase of 7% to 7.5% for the year versus the prior guidance of 5% to 7% and 3% to 5% when we started the year. 
In Electronic Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 10% for the quarter, with growth across all ES businesses as the first half ADS-B headwind subsided. This strong growth was driven by long-term platforms like the F-35, the F-18 and F-16, which collectively grew more than 25% as we leveraged technology upgrades, ramped production and expanded our international footprint.  
In Avionics, we continue to generate double-digit growth in weapons release systems, even excluding F-35 growth, with new content awards and increased production of both domestic and international platforms.  Segment order growth accelerated in the quarter to 56% for a book-to-bill of 1.4, and orders are now up 32% on a year-to-date basis. We booked more than $300 million in orders across F-35, F-18 and F-16 platforms, including a $184 million contract supplying electronic jammers to protect U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F-18 aircraft against electronic threats. Orders across the 3 platforms, F-35, F-18, F-16, have more than doubled this year to over $900 million and are on track to hit $1 billion for the year. 
Overall for ES, solid third quarter results have mitigated the first half ADS-B impact, with year-to-date revenue now up 4% and a book-to-bill of 1.3, resulting in a backlog increase of 21%. This, combined with an $18 billion opportunity pipeline and $4 billion of proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will grow 4.5% to 5% this year and that the growth will accelerate in the medium term. 
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 1%, as Classified programs continued to grow mid-single digits from the ramp-up of smallsat, ground-based adjacency and space surveillance programs, offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. 
Order momentum also remained strong in the Classified area with additional customer funding for long-standing programs in new adjacencies. In addition, we were awarded an approximately $500 million multiyear contract to provide payloads for an exquisite classified space system, reflecting continued success in leveraging technology to not only expand as a full-mission solution partner in smallsats, but also to strengthen our position as a partner of choice on large exquisite platforms. 
I'm also pleased to note a few accomplishments that strengthened our competitive position on important missions. 
In the Environmental Solutions business, the launch of NOAA's GOES-S satellite in early March included our second advanced baseline imager, or ABI, which improves fire detection and severe weather forecasting. This follows a successful launch of GOES-R in November of 2016, which has provided unprecedented imagery of recent hurricanes, with 4x the resolution and 5x the download speed, providing forecasters with 30-second updates of the entire Western Hemisphere. Harris ABIs are also on last 2 of NOAA's latest generation of geostationary weather satellites, GOES-T and GOES-U, with the entire constellation controlled by Harris' enterprise ground system. 
We continue to execute well on GPS, with a proven and reliable production cadence that included delivering a fifth GPS III navigation payload in early March, 26 days ahead of schedule. Strong execution along with a developed and fully tested 100% digital mission data unit positions us well for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award. Year-to-date, Space and Intel revenue was up 1%, and orders were up 6%, resulting in a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Our pipeline has grown by 14% to $13 billion over the past year, and with the recent successes of expanding into new adjacencies, we're confident this business can be a growth driver in the medium term. 
In summary, with our strong year-to-date performance, continued order momentum and an improved outlook on the back of a favorable GFY '18 budget resolution, we're tightening our fiscal '18 guidance and now expect revenue to be up approximately 4% from the previous guidance of 3% to 4%. This growth, combined with our strong operating performance, gives us confidence to tighten our EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.50 at the high end of the previous range and increase free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $925 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

As a reminder, statements today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. 
Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter with growth across all 3 segments. 
Operating income was up 7% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 30 basis points to 19.3%. 
EPS grew 21% and was up 12% excluding the benefit of tax reform. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $121 million, as higher revenues and order momentum in the back end of the quarter resulted in a $120 million increase of receivables and inventory, which will unwind in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date revenue was up 4%, and operating income was up 3%, despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $451 million, a 10% increase over the prior year as we enter our strongest cash-generation quarter. 
We have returned a total of about $400 million to shareholders, including approximately $200 million in share repurchases. In addition, we prefunded the pension by $300 million in the third quarter. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was about $900 million. 
Turning to the third quarter EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 21% or $0.29. Of this, $0.11 of EPS growth came from higher volume in Tactical radios, Avionics and Classified space, solid program execution and higher pension income. This was partially offset by lower environmental volume and increased R&D investment. Lower share count and reduced interest expense contributed $0.06. 
Lastly, a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform, added $0.12 to EPS growth. 
Segment details on Slide 7. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $481 million, up 4% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in DoD Tactical, Night Vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continued to improve execution and increase its share of wallet with the Army. Operating income for the segment was up 5% to $147 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 30.6% on higher volume. 
Orders grew for the seventh straight quarter, up 20% with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strong bookings in Tactical, PSPC orders grew 28% on increased demand for legacy system upgrades from state and local agencies. 
Night Vision orders grew 10%, with continued momentum from the U.S. Army, and we received a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 6%, and operating income was up 8%. 
Operating margin of 29.6% was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date segment orders have increased 36% with a book-to-bill of 1.3, and it's greater than 1 in all 3 businesses in this segment: Tactical, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $609 million, up 10% for the quarter. In addition to the growth in Avionics and electronic warfare that Bill mentioned, we saw a solid revenue increase from the ramp of U.K. robotics and UAE battle management programs. Segment operating income declined $3 million and higher volume was more than offset by increased R&D investment and program revenue mix. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 4%, and operating margin was down to 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program, R&D investment and program revenue mix. 
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence Systems, segment revenue was up 1% and operating income was up 8%, as margins expanded 100 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 1%, with continued growth in Classified programs offset by a decline in environmental revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 17.7%. 
Moving to Slide 10 for full year guidance. As Bill indicated, given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up about 4% for the year, reflecting strength in DoD Tactical and Avionics. We're tightening the EPS guidance at the high end of the range to $6.45 to $6.50 from drop-through on higher volume. Tax rate guidance is now 22.5% from 23% previously. The $0.04 benefit from lower tax rate will be offset by higher-than-expected share dilution and an increase in interest expense from the additional debt raised for pension prefunding. 
In Communication Systems, we are increasing the revenue guidance to be up 7% to 7.5% versus up 5% to 7% previously from improved DoD Tactical outlook and Night Vision readiness demand. In Electronic Systems, we're narrowing revenue guidance to the higher end of the range to be now up 4.5% to 5% versus up 4% to 5% previously, as strong orders in Avionics convert to revenue. 
In Space and Intelligence, we're narrowing the revenue guidance to be up approximately 0.5% versus flat to up 1% previously. For each segment, margins are still expected to be around the midpoint of the guidance ranges at about 30% in Communication Systems, 18.5% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence.

We're now in the final innings of fiscal '18, and we feel good about our year-to-date results and our expectations for the balance of the year. The passage of the GFY '18 omnibus bill and the trend line of the President's budget in '19 and beyond are real positives for Harris and the programs we support, especially in strategic growth areas where we've invested in R&D over the past several years and have strong customer positions. 
Tactical radio budgets have increased by an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years compared with where they were this time last year. F-35 and F-18 aircraft quantities have been increased, Classified space and other IC budgets are trending up, and the FA programs are well funded. Overall, our bid and proposal activity remains high, our win rates are solid, and our order rates -- our orders in backlog continue to grow, setting us up for accelerating growth in '19 and in the medium term as we execute against our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

As I mentioned in my remarks, Tactical radio is pretty good. We see additional aircraft quantities, and we're very encouraged about the trend line on the intelligence budgets, including areas that we've been able to stake a position, like in smallsats. So we're very encouraged by that. At the beginning of the year, we set out a framework which showed mid-single-digit growth across the medium term. And while we're not providing any guidance today, I see it today being incrementally better than when we started the year. And you can see that in sort of the trend lines, based on what we've seen over the course of our fiscal '18. In CS, we started the year at 3% to 5%, we went to 5% to 7%, now we're in the 7% to 7.5% range. DoD Tactical, we started the beginning of the year at mid-teens, we went to 20% growth year-over-year, now we're about 30%. We're seeing much greater traction in the electronic warfare and Avionics segments. So when I sit and look at it, it feels better incrementally than it did before, so maybe mid-single digits plus in '19 and beyond. Clearly, the CS segment, we said was, at the time, I think, mid-single digits. It's probably mid to high. I think Electronic Systems was mid to high, and it's probably at the high end of that. And I would say, also on the Space and Intel business, which we were thinking was low- to mid-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year, feels closer to mid-single-digit growth, principally because of getting the traction in smallsats as well as the very significant win that we recently received in the -- on an exquisite payload. So that all is very encouraging, and I see us being a bit incrementally better in '19 and beyond than we thought at the beginning of the year."

We have detailed conversations with them, and they help us think through how we can invest our IRAD spend, both on radio, but probably more importantly, on next-generation waveforms that are low probability of intercept, low probability of detection, anti-jam waveforms that can operate effectively in contested environments. So we're very tightly linked with them. As you know, they've decided to separate the decisions around the upper tactical network, which is around WIN-T -- we've got a radio and a waveform that's positioned there -- from the lower tactical, which is around the radios.

So there is a tax reform benefit next year. And then we have about $15 million to $20 million of cash outflow from Exelis integration in fiscal '18. That should wind down by '19. And there'll be incremental benefit from increased earning. So there's a clear line of sight to getting to $1 billion by '19. And then beyond that, where cash flow should grow with earnings, there is -- we do see opportunities on working capital improvement, and we'll deal with that when we get there in terms of how that all mix changes between revenue growth and working capital. But we see line of sight to $1 billion next year and then growth with the earnings beyond that."

So the International Tactical pipeline is around $2.3 billion and again, it's about where it's been over the last number of quarters. And I think it's good news that despite the orders, it's holding relatively stable. The -- about 55% of that is in Middle East and Africa, and that's a little higher than it was last quarter, so we continue to see opportunities flowing into the pipeline in the Middle East, as we've talked about Iraq in the past. Iraq is a very big, important opportunity, it's well funded. There's lots of opportunities for us to grow in Iraq. We see opportunities in Kuwait, some opportunities evolving in the Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, especially as we continue to execute well on the Emirati Land Tactical system, the network system that we're installing there, which is going to be going through an IOC very, very soon, hitting a key milestone. So we see good opportunities continuing in the Middle East. Europe is about 20%, more or less, of the pipeline. Again, we've -- we continue to see opportunities in the Ukraine. That looks fairly, fairly good as well as other NATO countries. And we're starting to see more opportunities in Western Europe evolve in Europe as well. In Asia, that's about 10% of the pipeline. So Australia is a key part of what we're executing there. That $260 million systems opportunity is going well. It's about that revenue opportunity in fiscal '18. It'll grow in '19 and '20 as we continue to work and complete that program. It's going well so far with the front end but going well. But there is a lot of follow-on opportunities in Australia as we execute well on that particular program. So I'm very encouraged about what's happening in the Asia-Pacific region. And importantly, as we develop more and more credibility around installing network systems, which is a much bigger market for us -- and I went through a couple of the examples of what we've done in the past and what we're working on today, including another opportunity in a Southeast Asian country that was just awarded to us in terms of a systems modernization that builds on a legacy installed base. So those are the big major opportunities. Central and Latin America is about 10% of the pipeline. It depends on what we see happening in Colombia and Mexico. Last year was very a very good year for Mexico. This year is a bit softer. But we do expect to see -- continue to see recapitalizations there. And then Central Asia, which is Afghanistan, Pakistan, was a small piece of the pipeline, very small piece of our revenue this year. It could start to grow over time. I'm not looking at that being a growth market for us in fiscal '19. So maybe that's a little bit of color on the international side."

We -- when the market was really soft, we executed on the Exelis transaction. We integrated very, very well. And I think it's positioned us, helped us reshape the portfolio as well. So sitting here today, we're going to generate a lot of cash in the next couple of years, sort of north of $2 billion of cash in the next few years.

So it leaves a lot of capacity for either M&A or to buy back our stock as we continue to see value in our stock, both this quarter as well as going into next year.

That's been a proven strategy. It's worked very, very well, and that's why we've got a very high share even of the international markets we play in, where they're not restricted markets. And we laid out a very clear strategy to investors of taking that solid base and opening up the addressable markets. So going more into network systems. So where we have the radio, packaging systems around that to make it easier to use and more intelligent for the end users like Australia, like what we've done in the UAE and other places, as well as get a systems opportunity in markets where maybe we don't have the incumbent radio position and use that as a way to go in and pull the radio that may be with another competitor into Harris. So that's been a clear direction that we've been on, as well as take our great position on ground radios into the airborne side. And clearly, the ARC-201 product from the Exelis allows us to go into that particular market, as well as airborne ISR. And again, this is a very important win that we just received in the last week. This $130 million IDIQ, I think, is testament to the capabilities that we have across these different domains. And Carter, these are areas that we've been investing in IRAD in over the last couple of years. So I don't see a big step-up from here to go and penetrate these domains. I see it as a continuation of the investments we have been making. The other thing we've talked quite a bit about is some of the adjacencies that we're attacking in the intelligence community. We've talked about moving over time from being a component supplier to supplying subsystems to now supplying complete end-to-end mission solutions, like we've done on smallsat. That has been a significant investment on our part. The -- our IRAD investment in our Space and Intelligence business has crept up over time. And it really is going after those kinds of opportunities. Winning this $0.5 billion exquisite system that we just won in the last couple of weeks, which is -- which really shows the power of the model we have in our Space and Intelligence business to both go after new end-to-end mission solutions as a prime but also be the partner of choice for components and subsystems for large exquisite systems. So I think this balance is working very, very well for us. And as I see, going forward, I see our IRAD in the same range we're in today as a percentage of revenue. Could tick up a little bit but not materially."

And when you look at the performance of the company, we're more than 99.5% on time for over 1 million components that we delivered to date on F-35, so we're a very good supplier there. We've reduced cost by more than 2/3 from the first ship set on F-35. So I think we've demonstrated capability and willingness to work hard to take -- continue to take cost out. As the customer and our partners are moving to block buys, it'll help us continue to take cost out.

We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% and revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segments and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.6%. For the year, earnings per share was up 18% to $6.50 on 5% revenue growth, and we generated record free cash flow of $915 million, 160% of net income. Orders were up 18% and increased by double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, ending the year up 23% with a book-to-bill of 1.2 and backlog of 26%, all driven by our multiyear investment in innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates and an improving budget environment.
Rahul  will walk through the details of the quarter and full year financial results, but I want to take a moment to just recap the highlights of the year on Slide 4.
Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 9% from strength in DoD Tactical and Night Vision. DoD Tactical revenue was up 46% in the quarter and 35% for the year, driven by more than $100 million of readiness demand from the Army and the Air Force to support deployment of security forces overseas with upgraded software-defined radios. Order momentum was even stronger, up 81% for the year to support readiness and the ramp of modernization programs. Notable wins include the first order for the Army HMS Manpack; additional orders from the Marine Corps for Manpack radios with meals capability; and a $765 million sole-source IDIQ for Navy and Marine Corps Falcon 3 and NextGen radios, double the previous contract and aligned with the budget request for Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years.
We were also awarded a sole-source 5-year, $130 million IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link radio to provide airborne collected ISR information to forces on the ground, representing the successful execution of our strategy to penetrate adjacent markets like tactical ISR.
International Tactical also performed well with revenue up 10% for the quarter and down less than 1% for the year, as increased demand in the Middle East and Africa to support counterterrorism activity and the ramp of the Australia modernization program in the Asia Pacific region, offset the expected decline in Eastern Europe. International orders were up 25% in the year with -- which combined with our robust and diverse pipeline give us confidence that international will return to growth in fiscal '19.
Overall for the year, Tactical ended the year stronger than we first expected with revenue up 11%, orders up 41% and backlog up 82% to about $900 million, giving us confidence and continued growth in Tactical and the broader CS segment in fiscal '19 and beyond.
In Electronic Systems, after our flattish first half due to the ADS-B transition, second half revenue growth accelerated to 9% with growth across all ES businesses and ending the year above the high-end of our 5% guidance range. The key driver was long-term platforms like the F-35, F-18 and F-16, which collectively grew by more than 20% as a result of technology upgrades, ramped production and increased content. Two international programs, U.K. Robotics and the UAE Battle Management, also contributed to strong year-over-year growth in ES.
Segment orders increased 33% to $3.1 billion with more than -- which more -- and more than doubled over $1 billion on the F-35, the F-18 and the F-16 platforms. In June, we were awarded a $400 million sole-sourced IDIQ to supply electronic warfare systems for international F-16s. It's a key gaping item as we were to capturing an estimated $1.5 billion opportunity. On the F-18, we had the best orders year on record, and we received 2 awards totaling $320 million to supply electronic jammers, to protect U.S. and international F-18 against electronic threats, supporting multiyear growth on this important platform.
We continue to make progress on the international pursuits, successfully delivering our first 2 robotic systems for explosive ordinance disposal missions to the U.K. MOD. Achieving this milestone is important as we pursue other international opportunities in the upcoming U.S. DoD Common Robotic System Competition. We also leveraged our FAA managed services model to capture a 15-year $141 million contract in the quarter to modernize India's air traffic management communications infrastructure, supporting growth in one of the world's largest aviation markets.
Overall for Electronic Systems, book-to-bill was 1.3 for the year and backlog increased 30% to $2.6 billion. This, combined with a $17 billion pipeline and $4.5 billion at proposals outstanding, give us confidence that revenue will continue to accelerate in fiscal '19.
In space and intel, revenue was up 1% for the year as growth in classified programs from the ramp of smallsats, ground-based adjacencies and space surveillance programs, offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. Investments in R&D and innovation ahead of the customer needs, resulted in double-digit growth in classified orders for the year, as we strengthened our global leadership in hosted payloads, increase our share of wallet with existing customers and expanded our addressable market from components to now full-mission solutions.
Orders for the segment grew 6% and book-to-bill was slightly greater than 1 for the year.
With about 80% of fiscal '19 revenue and backlog and high confidence, follow-on opportunities, a $14 billion pipeline, continued strength in classified space and decreasing headwinds on our environmental programs, we now expect mid-single-digit growth for the segment in fiscal '19.
We continue to maintain best-in-class margins and generate a record free cash flow of $915 million, returning about $550 million to shareholders. We also achieved our post-Exelis debt reduction commitment of $2 billion and pre-funded our pension plan to about 90%, with no required contributions until 2025, creating future cash flow flexibility.
But our strong operation performance wouldn't be possible without a relentless focus on operational excellence. This program is what we call Harris Business Excellence or HBX. HBX is an integral part of Harris' culture and continuous improvement and its contributed successes across the enterprise.
For example, the Night Vision over the last 2 years, we've improved yield and on-time delivery while lowering costs, resulting in significant margin expansion and double-digit growth. This business has moved from being a watched area when we acquired Exelis to a growth driver. And the improved returns gave us the room to increase investment to compete on upcoming U.S. and international modernization programs.
On the F-35 program, we've delivered over 1 million parts with greater than 99.95% on-time delivery, and we received the Outstanding Supplier Award in weapons release factory in Amityville. Operational performance and the commitment to innovation has driven increased content per ship set with opportunities to expand it further in the future. And on the F-18, program to franchise more than $1 billion in orders to date, we've cut factory cycle time by 10% and have been recognized by the Navy for maintaining a 100% on-time delivery record over the past 20 years.
In space and intel, you've heard me speak about improved execution on the SENSOR program, and we continue to make progress, with on-time delivery increasing from 35% when we acquired Exelis to 90% today, driving 15% revenue growth on the program just this past year.
And finally on GPS III, we corrected the legacy issues and established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering the fifth payload in March with #6 through 8th expected by early next year.
And that with the recently developed fully digital mission data unit, we are well-positioned for the upcoming GPSIIIF award and maintaining incumbency.
Overall, we've had an exceptional year in which we returned to growth and generated record earnings per share and free cash flow, meeting or exceeding the targets we set for ourselves. For fiscal '19, we expect to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, accelerating growth in all 3 segments, increasing margins and maximizing cash. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $7.65 to $7.85 on revenue growth of 6% to 8% and to achieve our $1 billion free cash flow goal.
Let me now turn it over to Rahul to walk through our financial results and additional details of fiscal '19 guidance before I close with a few comments on our medium-term outlook. Rahul?"

Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased",1056,"Thank you,  Bill, and good morning, everyone. Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 11% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 50 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19% or $0.29, and excluding the benefit of tax reform, was up 12% or $0.18. Free cash flow was a record $464 million for the quarter.
Turning to the full year EPS range on Slide 6. EPS grew by 18% or $0.97. The expected $0.21 headwind from the ADS-B program transition was offset by disciplined capital deployment. Half of the EPS growth was from higher volume in tactical communications, avionics and classified space. Solid program execution, productivity and higher pension income offset by lower environmental volume and program mix. The other half came from a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform.
On Slide 7. Communication systems revenue in the quarter was $523 million, up 16% versus the prior year, with growth across all the 3 businesses in the segment. In addition to the strong growth of 21% in Tactical, Night Vision revenue was a gain of double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 11%, $262 million from higher volume and operational efficiencies. Operating margin remained strong at 31% and orders were up 6%, growing for the eighth consecutive quarter. For the full year, revenue and operating income each increased 9% with operating margin up 30%. Segment orders increased 28%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and greater than 1 in each of the 3 businesses in the segment. We've continued to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog, as supplemental information at the end of the presentation.
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $640 million, up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in Avionics, electronic warfare and C4ISR. Segment operating income increased 14% to $119 million from higher volume and strong operational performance. [indiscernible] grew double digits for the fifth straight quarter, up 38% with a book-to-bill of 1.3. For the full year, segment revenue was up 5% and operating margin was at 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program transition, incremental investment and shifts in program revenue mix.
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence, revenue for the fourth quarter was up 0.04 points and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 110 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income.
For the full year, revenue was up 1%, as continued growth in classified programs was partially offset by an expected decline in environmental programs revenue. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.5%.
Switching to guidance for fiscal '19. We have adopted a new revenue recognition standards, ASC 606, using the full retrospective method, effective at the beginning of fiscal '19. And often, the new standard requires adjusting the timing of recognition of revenue and associated program costs for a few contracts, treatment of certain expenses but does not materially impact the total financial results. Our guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standards and the preliminary recast and historical financials are included as supplemental information on Slide 16.
For fiscal '19, the revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% over the recasted fiscal '18 days, which is $11 million lower than the reported numbers, so not a material impact. The growth in the year is driven by continued DoD Tactical modernization as well as growth across electronic warfare, avionics, battle management and classified space programs. We expect total company EBIT margin to be between 19.3% and 19.7% from strong growth in higher-margin Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments.
Fiscal '19 EPS is expected to be between $7.65 and $7.85 and includes a placeholder of $400 million for share repurchases and an effective tax rate of 17%. We expect to generate greater than or equal to $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '19, reflecting higher earnings and cash tax benefit from pension pre-funding, partially offset by increased working capital, higher capital expenditures and the timing of tax payments. We ended fiscal '18 with working capital of 42 days, a 1 day improvement over 2017 and 2019 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance. Capital expenditures grow by approximately $35 million to $170 million to support new program starts. We are expecting accelerated growth in each of the segments in fiscal '19. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up between 8% and 10% with DoD Tactical up mid- to high-teens, Night Vision up double digits and international tactical and public safety up low to mid-single digits.
Modernization growth in DoD Tactical will primarily occur in the second half of the fiscal year, as we start to ship Manpacks for the Army and ramp up production and deliveries of handhelds for SOCOM and the Army. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the diluted margin impact of new program starts and incremental systems work that is more than offset by the benefits from operational excellence and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be up between 7% and 8%, driven by strong growth in Avionics and electronic warfare as fiscal '18 backlog converts to revenue and the continued ramp of UAE battle management program. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 18% and 19% as growth from lower-margin programs is offset by operational excellence.
In space and intelligence, revenue is expected to be up between 4% and 5%. Classified business, representing about 2/3 of the segment is expected to grow high single digits, partially offset by continued modest weakness in environmental programs, which we expect to reach a trough this fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the volume increase and operational efficiencies.
Fiscal '19 EPS bridge on Slide 11. EPS is expected to grow between $1.15 and $1.35 from higher volume across the 3 segments: Operational efficiencies; lower tax rate, including the benefit of tax reform; and accretive capital deployment.
And with that, let me turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin busines",539,"Okay, well, thank you,  Rahul. I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, successfully integrated Exelis and made disciplined investments in the business that led to several new product launches and strategic program wins. We also derisked the balance sheet to give us more financial flexibility. Fiscal '18 was an inflection point for Harris as we return to growth and grew backlog significantly. This, combined with a more favorable budget environment, especially in strategic growth areas, positioned us well to accelerate growth in fiscal '19 in the medium term.
At this time last year, I laid out the medium-term growth drivers by segment, as shown on Slide 14. And over the past year, we've seen the outlook improvement in each of them. Communication and electronic systems are expected to grow high single digits and space and intel at mid-single digits. The higher end of the medium-term range for all 3 segments that we indicated this time last year. In Tactical, we're beginning to see the DoD modernization ramp across all the services. And international has stabilized and is returning to growth as we leverage our incumbency and large installed base and benefit from higher defense spending by coalition partners.
In Electronic Systems, avionics and electronic warfare are entering a multiyear growth cycle, driven by our position in long-term platforms. And in space and intel, classified growth will accelerate, as we maintain high win rates and expanding to adjacencies in a growing budget environment and the headwinds in the environmental business now become tailwinds.
We've been on a multiyear journey to improve margins. And while we made progress in driving productivity and efficiency in recent years, I see much more opportunity in front of us. We're now halfway through standardizing our systems that will reduce the number of ERP platforms from 28 to 3, simplifying our operating environment, driving productivity through growth and shared services, operating core processes and laying the foundation of our enterprisewide digital strategy. By the end of this year, we will have eliminated 80% of our data centers, and by fiscal '21, the remainder will be fully cloud enabled.
We recently hired a new Chief Technology Officer, who's fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of every R&D dollar we invest. We're fully deploying dev ops to streamline software development, which is going to be more than 40% of our engineering work today and is expected to increase over time. And we continue to squeeze more cost savings out of our supply chain through value engineering and should cause analysis on new products and improving supplier performance and reducing sole-source components on legacy solutions.
Taking together, this relentless focus on operational excellence, combined with the leverage on incremental volume that will drive margin expansion and communication Electronic Systems as well as for Harris as a whole.
In summary, we expect higher revenue, higher margin, double-digit earnings-per-share growth and sustained cash generation through the medium-term. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And of course over in the Communication Systems segment and Tactical, as we see the ramp of modernization programs, as we said before on this call, we'll  see those programs coming at slightly lower than segment or normal Tactical margin but improving over time as we continue to take cost out of the product as we've done many times in the past."

We're one of the 3 companies that are in the hunt for that. And on the front you might heard Lockheed talking about what they might do on the IC&I as well on that EW platform and given our progress so far on EW and work we've done through software-defined EW, a big investment over the last several years, small size and weight in power systems, really improvements in cognitive and the algorithms we have, we think we'll be a player there if they decide to move down the path and recompete that. And so as I look at F-35 and both are going to grow from a volume perspective, but I think net-net, I see opportunities to increase our content per chipset over time."

It's up pretty substantially in the CS business as well as the space and intel segment. So we think, based on where the backlog is, the pipeline we have, the bids that are outstanding, I see more visibility on revenue in fiscal '19 than we'd say going into '18 a year ago."

They are up in the fiscal '19, NDAA from '18, and '18 was up about 17%, 20% from fiscal '16 and then growing to about $1 billion or $1.2 billion a year over the next several years. So the funding that's supporting the overall Tactical business is very, very strong, including the HMS Manpack. We're doing well. We had a delivery order now LRIP delivery order for 1,129 units that will be delivered in fiscal '19, and we expect that we'll see another LRIP order probably in the back half of our fiscal '19 of some size, leading into operational testing in fiscal '20.

In fact, having a new CTO in the team over the last year is really helping us dig in a lot more to where we're spending our money and where we shouldn't be spending our money going forward. I mean, you're right, over the last couple of years, we raised our investment in IRAD. This year, we closed at just over 5% of revenue, which is above where everyone else in the segment, it appears happen to be because it's going to go up again a little bit in fiscal '20. When tax reform was enacted, we took our fiscal '18 number up $20 million because we sold new opportunities in things like robotics that we invested in. So we continue to look at how we spend money, we look at the return on different programs, we look at how we leverage capabilities across the company. Lots of places around Harris invest in various features of software or waveforms, and we're thinking about how do we leverage the investments we have across the company in a more productive way. So as one of the things our CTO is helping us think about. As I go out a year or 2 or 3 from here, I don't think we'll be substantially higher then as a percentage of revenue, so I see it neither as a margin drag nor tailwind on our margins. But if we continue to find got opportunities to invest in, invest ahead of the curve, invest ahead of where the customers going to go. And I think as you look at the results we're pointing out today and very good growth. It really does come from some of the IRAD investments we've made in the last 3 or 4 years."

So in 2019, our net income is up about $140 million and we capped the tax cash tax benefit of about $90 million from the pension funding that we did or pre-funding that we did back in '18. And that's getting partially offset by increase in working capital of about $30 million to $40 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days come down by 1 day. But we still -- because of revenue growth, we still see some drag on working capital. So there's about $35 million of CapEx growth, and that's primarily to fund new program starts like the FBI India one that Bill mentioned. Our European investment to some multiyear investment, bit of step up in that as well. Classified wins that we got in space this year, that required a little bit of CapEx. So you wanted to put $35 million growth in CapEx, and then there are some cash tax refunds that we've got in '19 from overpayments in fiscal '18 that we discussed earlier and that's a headwind as well and that won't repeat. So you put all that together, we feel good about the $1 billion. But as we look further out, Jon, and look into fiscal '20 and the big onetime item that we have in fiscal '19 is this $90 million of cash tax benefit from pension pre-funding. As we look at fiscal '20, we think there's several offsets to that. The biggest being we've -- we have not yet recovered the Exelis restructuring outflows that we had from the government. It's a proposal [indiscernible] some of the restructuring proposal. It's a multiyear approval process, and we start recovering all the money that we have previously spent and we recovered that through our cost-plus program. So there's a little bit of outflow in Exelis restructuring and that's still happening in the $10 million to $15 million range, that kind of goes away. We do think that CapEx is a tailwind in fiscal '20 because a lot of the program CapEx will be kind of behind us, also the ERP implementation starts winding down. And then we'll be working on several other cash tax savings projects that we kicked off this year and will start delivering results in fiscal '20. So if we can put all of that together, there's enough to offset the $90 million of onetime benefit that we'll get in fiscal '19 and then earnings drive cash flow growth in '20 and beyond."

What I've seen very positively in the NDAA which passed the House. It's supposed to be at the Senate this week.

I think very encouraging to us as well as all the people who issue procurement decisions in the DoD if the NDAA get signed that quickly and maybe even an Appropriations bill by the end of September, that's even a possibility. So I think these are all very positive indicators. So when you look at Harris, the last time I talked about the medium term as mid-single-digit growth plus I think now it's mid- to high-single digit, you see that coming through at '19. It's really across the segments. I think a very important driver of that is going to be in the Communication Systems segment, where we do see a very strong ramp in DoD, in the tactical radio business. And we've been focusing a lot on commentary around the Army. We see the budgets growing pretty dramatically on the Army over the next 4 or 5 years, but you also see SOCOM growing, you see the Air Force being strong and you see the Marine Corps recap coming in quite substantially. So when I look at our next 5 years, we have about $5.5 billion worth of budget available to Harris in the tactical radio side that supports our business, cumulative over the next 5 years. So that's very, very encouraging to me. We also see I think great progress in some of the platforms in both Avionics and electronic warfare. I think we're just really starting this big growth. The IDIQ and one on the F-16's platform internationally was $400 million. So we booked an award for Turkey in Q4, that was 60. We had Morocco before that. We have about $1.5 billion opportunity that's ahead of us on international F-16s. F-18 is going to grow. The F-35 is going to grow. And again, I think we are on the front end of a nice growth trajectory on the space Classified business. So Sheila, really, as I look at the business, and I see even think that had been headwinds turning to tailwinds like environmental, really across the franchise, we're seeing really good growth prospects. Some of it is driven by a -- and a lot of that are driven by where the budgets are going.

It can grow to 50%, 55%, 60%. I think we're going to attribute to the pipeline, Sheila, is how good we are at the investing and maturing dev ops within this company so that we become strategically better than other players in this space so we can develop software faster with lower defect rates, with better capability. I think the more we can do that, that is where I think it's going to contribute mostly to the top line, as I see that. To me, over the next 4 or 5 years, I think it's going to be fundamental to how we, and probably other players in the space, develop products. A lot of it is going to turn on software. I think the best people in this space are the ones who are going to win."

We talked the last quarter about $0.5 billion exquisite when that we have to a prime on a missionary that we've had some experience on. It's going to deliver over the next 5, 6 years. Our piece of that is more -- probably more front-end-loaded. There's some capital associated with that program. When we've talked over the last year about our positioning on smallsats, we have multiple contract awards on that, that's going exceptionally well, there's some capital associated with that. And as that matures over the next 12 months or so, there's lots of other missionaries and components and capabilities that will be augmenting that smallsat mission that we'll position ourselves on. It's all, I think, very exciting. Space Superiority is a huge growth driver for the company ago I talked about our growth in that area being more than 15% this past year, and we see that continuing to grow. We think we're well-positioned for opportunities for ground control systems as well as space situational awareness. So lots of different ways we're competing on space superiority. And the last one is on the optics side. With Exelis, we acquired a great capability up in our Rochester facility for optics. And there is a recap of a lot of different capabilities in the space, some are RF-related and some are optics-related. And those recapitalizations sometimes require some additional capital investment. So that all goes together, and some of the things we're spending our growth capital on in '19. As Rahul mentioned, we're up to about 170 in '19. We'll see that mitigate itself a little bit going into fiscal '20, probably down around $15 million or $20 million, as we get through a lot of these sort of onetime growth capital we see in '19."

So 2% to 3% savings, net of what's giving back to the government, net of inflation, dropping to the bottom line. And we've been running towards the high-end of that 2.5% to 3% range, really over the last 5 or 6 years, and I expect that to continue and maybe even go above that over the next several years. What's driving it is changing over time, of course, supply chain is important and there's some engineering productivity and labor productivity in our factory. But even through Exelis integration, we continue to see come on top of the savings from Exelis integration, opportunity to just get better everyday at what we do and that's going to be continuation. So that was from my experience at UTC and what I see other companies doing. So I think that is generally pretty good. In terms of benchmarking on ERP systems, it's hard to say, but I can tell you 20 systems today is too many and 3 is about the right number. We've got a government business, we've got a commercial business and one -- it's fairly unique, which is why we're at 3. And really, what we're doing is we're bringing people into the company in senior roles either in IT or technology or other places that have experience outside of Harris that really look at what we do and bring best practices from their experiences here. And that is what's giving us some shining the light on some of the opportunities that really are in front of us. And as I said, as I look into the future, I see as much opportunity ahead of us, as I've seen we captured in the recent past. So I think the ground is pretty fertile on continuing to get better, drive efficiency and productivity really across our business in the next couple of years."

So there's some acceleration there. We see CS and communications to continue to be at a high single-digit range. Frankly, I think, as I look back on '18 and when we started our guidance on '18 -- keep in mind we started -- I believe, it was 15% or mid-teens on DoD Tactical, and then we went up to 20 or low 20s, and we ended at 35%. So I'm not so sure I'm really sort of calling it accurate. I think we're being more conservative than aggressive in our assumptions, and hopefully, we're in the same place today in '19, and hopefully, beyond there as well. As we see opportunities placed -- put on order a lot faster than what we saw over the last couple of years and this is a pretty remarkable phenomenon, orders are being placed, dollars are being obligated at a much faster rate, not just in DoD but also in the intelligence community, certainly, from where we were a year or 2 ago. And that's been a very positive surprise. And like I said, and the NDAA, getting approved out of the House and maybe even getting approved by the President before we even hit September is pretty unique. And I think what's happening with things like that happening, it gives you encouragement to people who issue procurement decisions to obligate dollars faster. Their confidence goes up. So I continue to see opportunities in '19 and beyond. So what's medium-term, medium-term to us is 3 to 4 years because I look at it and we look at our positioning, the amount of unused dollars that aren't yet committed, where the budgets are growing and what we see -- and the budgets that we can actually see over the next 5 years, there's a lot of opportunity to continue really robust growth across Harris going out in that 3-, 4-, 5-year period, Rob."

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segmen",1404,"Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segments and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.6%. 
For the year, earnings per share was up 18% to $6.50 on 5% revenue growth, and we generated record free cash flow of $915 million, 160% of net income. Orders were up 18% and increased by double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, ending the year up 23% with a book-to-bill of 1.2 and backlog of 26%, all driven by our multiyear investment in innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates and an improving budget environment.
Rahul will walk through the details of the quarter and full year financial results, but I want to take a moment to just recap the highlights of the year on Slide 4. Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 9% from strength in DoD Tactical and Night Vision. DoD Tactical revenue was up 46% in the quarter and 35% for the year, driven by more than $100 million of readiness demand from the Army and the Air Force to support deployment of security forces overseas with upgraded software-defined radios. Order momentum was even stronger, up 81% for the year to support readiness and the ramp of modernization programs. Notable wins include the first LRIP order for the Army HMS Manpack; additional orders from the Marine Corps for Manpack radios with meals capability; and a $765 million sole-source IDIQ for Navy and Marine Corps Falcon III and NextGen radios, double the previous contract and aligned with the budget request for Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years.
We were also awarded a sole-source 5-year $130 million IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link radio to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, representing the successful execution of our strategy to penetrate adjacent markets like tactical ISR.
International Tactical also performed well with revenue up 10% for the quarter and down less than 1% for the year, as increased demand in the Middle East and Africa to support counterterrorism activity and the ramp of the Australia modernization program in the Asia Pacific region offset the expected decline in Eastern Europe. International orders were up 25% in the year with -- which combined with a robust and diverse pipeline gives us confidence that international will return to growth in fiscal '19.
Overall for the year, Tactical ended the year stronger than we first expected with revenue up 11%, orders up 41% and backlog up 82% to about $900 million, giving us confidence and continued growth in Tactical and the broader CS segment in fiscal '19 and beyond.
In Electronic Systems, after our flattish first half due to the ADS-B transition, second half revenue growth accelerated to 9% with growth across all ES businesses and ending the year above the high end of our 5% guidance range. The key driver was long-term platforms like the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, which collectively grew by more than 20% as a result of technology upgrades, ramped production and increased content. Two international programs, U.K. Robotics and the UAE battle management, also contributed to strong year-over-year growth in ES.
Segment orders increased 33% to $3.1 billion with more than -- which -- and more than doubled over $1 billion on the F-35, the F/A-18 and the F-16 platforms. In June, we were awarded by $400 million sole-sourced IDIQ to supply electronic warfare systems for international F-16s. It's a key gating item as we work towards capturing an estimated $1.5 billion opportunity. 
On the F/A-18, we had our best orders year on record and we received 2 awards totaling $320 million to supply electronic jammers to protect U.S. and international F/A-18 against electronic threats, supporting multiyear growth on this important platform.
We continue to make progress on international pursuits, successfully delivering our first 2 robotic systems for explosive ordinance disposal missions to the U.K. MoD. Achieving this milestone is important as we pursue other international opportunities in the upcoming U.S. DoD Common Robotic System competition. We also leveraged our FAA managed services model to capture a 15-year $141 million contract in the quarter to modernize India's air traffic management communications infrastructure, supporting growth in one of the world's largest aviation markets.
Overall for Electronic Systems, book-to-bill was 1.3 for the year and backlog increased 30% to $2.6 billion. This, combined with a $17 billion pipeline and $4.5 billion in proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will continue to accelerate in fiscal '19.
In Space and Intel, revenue was up 1% for the year as growth in classified programs from the ramp of smallsats, ground-based adjacencies and space surveillance programs offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. Investments in R&D and innovation ahead of the customer needs resulted in double-digit growth in classified orders for the year as we strengthened our global leadership in hosted payloads, increased our share of wallet with existing customers and expanded our addressable market from components to now full-mission solutions.
Orders for the segment grew 6% and book-to-bill was slightly greater than 1 for the year. With about 80% of fiscal '19, revenue and backlog and high-confidence follow-on opportunities, a $14 billion pipeline, continued strength in classified space and decreasing headwinds on our environmental programs, we now expect mid-single-digit growth for the segment in fiscal '19.
We continue to maintain best-in-class margins and generate a record free cash flow of $915 million, returning about $550 million to shareholders. We also achieved our post-Exelis debt-reduction commitment of $2 billion and prefunded our pension plan to about 90% with no required contributions until 2025, creating future cash flow flexibility.
But our strong operation performance wouldn't be possible without a relentless focus on operational excellence. This program we call Harris Business Excellence or HBX. HBX is an integral part of the Harris' culture of continuous improvement, and it's contributed to successes across the enterprise. For example, the Night Vision over the last 2 years, we've improved yield and on-time delivery while lowering cost, resulting in significant margin expansion and double-digit growth. This business has moved from being a watched area when we acquired Exelis to a growth driver, and the improved returns gave us the room to increase investment to compete on upcoming U.S. and international modernization programs.
On the F-35 program, we've delivered over a million parts with greater than 99.95% on-time delivery, and we received the Outstanding Supplier Award in our weapons release factory in Amityville. Operational performance and the commitment to innovation has driven increased content per ship set with opportunities to expand it further in the future. And on the F/A-18 IDECM program to franchise with more than $1 billion in orders to date, we've cut factory cycle time by 10% and have been recognized by the Navy for maintaining a 100% on-time delivery record over the past 20 years.
In Space and Intel, you've heard me speak about improved execution on the SENSOR program, and we continue to make progress with on-time delivery increasing from 35% when we acquired Exelis to 90% today, driving 15% revenue growth on the program just this past year.
And finally on GPS III, we corrected the legacy issues and established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering the fifth payload in March, with number 6 through 8 expected by early next year.
And now with the recently developed fully digital mission data unit, we're well positioned for the upcoming GPS IIIF award and maintaining incumbency.
Overall, we've had an exceptional year in which we returned to growth and generated record earnings per share and free cash flow, meeting or exceeding the targets we set for ourselves. For fiscal '19, we expect to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, accelerating growth in all 3 segments, increasing margins and maximizing cash. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $7.65 to $7.85 on revenue growth of 6% to 8% and to achieve our $1 billion free cash flow goal.
Let me now turn it over to Rahul to walk through our financial results and additional details of fiscal '19 guidance before I close with a few comments on our medium-term outlook. Rahul?"

As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 11% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 50 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19% or $0.29, and excluding the benefit of tax reform, was up 12% or $0.18. Free cash flow was a record $464 million for the quarter.
Turning to the full year EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 18% or $0.97. The expected $0.21 headwind from the ADS-B program transition was offset by disciplined capital deployment. Half of the EPS growth was from higher volume in Tactical Communications, Avionics and Classified space. Solid program execution, productivity and higher pension income offset by lower environmental volume and program mix. The other half came from a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform.
On Slide 7. Communication systems revenue in the quarter was $523 million, up 16% versus the prior year with growth across all the 3 businesses in the segment. In addition to the strong growth of 21% in Tactical, Night Vision revenue was a gain of double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 11%, $262 million from higher volume and operational efficiencies. Operating margin remained strong at 31% and orders were up 6%, growing for the eighth consecutive quarter. For the full year, revenue and operating income each increased 9% with operating margin up 30%. Segment orders increased 28%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and greater than 1 in each of the 3 businesses in the segment. We've continued to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog, as supplemental information at the end of the presentation.
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $640 million, up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in Avionics, electronic warfare and C4ISR. Segment operating income increased 14% to $119 million from higher volume and strong operational performance. Orders grew double digits for the fifth straight quarter, up 38% with a book-to-bill of 1.3. For the full year, segment revenue was up 5% and operating margin was at 18.6% as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program transition, incremental investment and shifts in program revenue mix.
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence, revenue for the fourth quarter was up 0.4% and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 110 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. For the full year, revenue was up 1% as continued growth in classified programs was partially offset by an expected decline in environmental programs revenue. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.5%.
Switching to guidance for fiscal '19. We have adopted a new revenue recognition standards, ASC 606, using the full retrospective method effective at the beginning of fiscal '19. And often, the new standard requires adjusting the timing of recognition of revenue and associated program costs for a few contracts, treatment of certain expenses, but does not materially impact the total financial results. Our guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standard, and the preliminary recast and historical financials are included as supplemental information on Slide 16.
For fiscal '19, the revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% over the recasted fiscal '18 base, which is $11 million lower than the reported numbers. So not a material impact. The growth in the year is driven by continued DoD Tactical modernization as well as growth across electronic warfare, avionics, battle management and classified space programs. We expect total company EBIT margins to be between 19.3% and 19.7% from strong growth in higher-margin Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments.
Fiscal '19 EPS is expected to be between $7.65 and $7.85 and includes a placeholder of $400 million for share repurchases and an effective tax rate of 17%. We expect to generate greater than or equal to $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '19, reflecting higher earnings and cash tax benefit from pension prefunding, partially offset by increased working capital, higher capital expenditures and the timing of tax payments. We ended fiscal '18 with working capital of 42 days, a 1-day improvement over 2017, and 2019 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance. 
Capital expenditures grew by approximately $35 million to $170 million to support new program starts. We are expecting accelerated growth in each of the segments in fiscal '19. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up between 8% and 10% with DoD Tactical up mid- to high-teens, Night Vision up double digits and international tactical and public safety up low to mid-single digits.
Modernization growth in DoD Tactical will primarily occur in the second half of the fiscal year, as we start to ship Manpacks for the Army and ramp up production and deliveries of handhelds for SOCOM and the Army. 
Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the diluted margin impact of new program starts and incremental systems work that is more than offset by the benefits from operational excellence and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be up between 7% and 8%, driven by strong growth in Avionics and electronic warfare as fiscal '18 backlog converts to revenue and the continued ramp of UAE battle management program. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 18% and 19% as growth from lower-margin program is offset by operational excellence.
In Space and Intelligence, revenue is expected to be up between 4% and 5%. Classified business, representing about 2/3 of the segment is expected to grow high single digits, partially offset by continued modest weakness in environmental programs, which we expect to reach a trough this fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the volume increase and operational efficiencies.
Fiscal '19 EPS bridge on Slide 11. EPS is expected to grow between $1.15 and $1.35 from higher volume across the 3 segments: operational efficiencies; lower tax rate, including the benefit of tax reform; and accretive capital deployment.
And with that, let me turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin busines",540,"Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, successfully integrated Exelis and made disciplined investments in the business that led to several new product launches and strategic program wins. We also derisked the balance sheet to give us more financial flexibility. Fiscal '18 was an inflection point for Harris as we return to growth and grew backlog significantly. This, combined with a more favorable budget environment, especially in strategic growth areas, positioned us well to accelerate growth in fiscal '19 in the medium term.
At this time last year, I laid out the medium-term growth drivers by segment, as shown on Slide 14. And over the past year, we've seen the outlook improve in each of them. Communication and electronic systems are now expected to grow high single digits and space and intel at mid-single digits. The higher end of the medium-term range for all 3 segments that we indicated this time last year. In Tactical, we're beginning to see the DoD modernization ramp across all the services, and international has stabilized and is returning to growth as we leverage our incumbency and large installed base and benefit from higher defense spending by coalition partners.
In Electronic Systems, Avionics and electronic warfare are entering a multiyear growth cycle, driven by our position on long-term platforms. And in Space and Intel, classified growth will accelerate, as we maintain high win rates and expand into adjacencies in a growing budget environment, and the headwinds in the environmental business now become tailwinds.
We've been on a multiyear journey to improve margins. And while we made progress in driving productivity and efficiency in recent years, I see much more opportunity in front of us. We're now halfway through standardizing our systems that will reduce the number of ERP platforms from 28 to 3, simplifying our operating environment, driving productivity through growth and shared services, automating core processes and laying the foundation of our enterprise-wide digital strategy. By the end of this year, we will have eliminated 80% of our data centers, and by fiscal '21, the remainder will be fully cloud-enabled.
We recently hired a new Chief Technology Officer, who's fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of every R&D dollar we invest. We're fully deploying dev ops to streamline software development, which is growing to be more than 40% of our engineering work today and is expected to increase over time. And we continue to squeeze more cost savings out of our supply chain through value engineering and should cause analysis on new products and improving supplier performance and reducing sole-source components on legacy solutions.
Taking together, this relentless focus on operational excellence combined with the leverage on incremental volume that will drive margin expansion and communication Electronic Systems as well as for Harris as a whole.
In summary, we expect higher revenue, higher margin, double-digit earnings-per-share growth and sustained cash generation through the medium term. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But as we see growth in our segments, especially in our space and environmental -- in our Electronic Systems business, some new wins like the Classified business is coming in at lower-than-average segment margins, and that's growing pretty healthily. That will bring down the SIS segment a little bit, again offset by operational excellence. And of course, over the Communication Systems segment and Tactical, as we see the ramp of modernization programs, as we said before on this call, we'll see those programs coming at slightly lower than segment or normal Tactical margins, but improving over time as we continue to take cost out of the product as we've done many times in the past."

This year, we closed just over 5% of revenue, which is above where everyone else in the segment that appears happen to be. It's going to go up again a little bit in fiscal '20. When tax reform was enacted, we took our fiscal '18 number up about $20 million because we sold new opportunities in things like robotics that we invested in. So we continue to look at how we spend money, we look at the return on different programs, we look at how we leverage capabilities across the company. Lots of places around Harris invest in various features of software or waveforms, and we're thinking about how do we leverage the investments we have across the company in a more productive way. So as one of the things our CTO is helping us think about, as I go out a year or 2 or 3 from here, I don't think we'll be substantially higher than -- as a percentage of revenue. So I see it neither as a margin drag nor tailwind on our margins. But if we continue to find good opportunities to invest, invest ahead of the curve, invest ahead of where the customers are going to go.

We've been investing a lot on hardware over the last couple of years at SOCOM and the Army, all the products coming in. So even that is kind of coming to an end at this point. With SOCOM Manpack is one big program that we're going to work on next year. So a lot of the attention now is going to shift to waveforms and the software that goes on to those radios and how do we monetize that revenue stream as we've done previously with the newest waveform. So there's a shift of where we're spending the dollars is happening as well within our R&D space."

So there's really good opportunities there. About 30% is in Europe, and we're starting to see a little bit of a shift from Eastern Europe to Western Europe from countries like Poland and Romania to NATO countries in Western Europe still a little bit of a shift. And then the balance is going to be in Asia, in Central and Latin America, a little bit in Canada. In Asia, we see Australia, some additional opportunities on the horizon, other smaller countries in Asia. And we see in Central America, we see Mexico being a bigger opportunity in '19 than we had in '18. So overall, the trends I think are very positive in international. We have been having a good year in fiscal '18 in international, a little bit better than we thought, down less than 1%.

So in 2019, our net income is up about $140 million and we capped the cash tax benefit of about $90 million from the pension funding that we did or prefunding that we did back in '18, and that's getting partially offset by increase in working capital of about $20 million to $40 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days come down by 1 day, but we still -- because of revenue growth, we still see some drag on working capital. So there's about $35 million of CapEx growth, and that's primarily to fund new program starts like the FBI India what Bill mentioned. Our ERP investment is a multiyear investment, a litlle bit of step-up in that as well. Classified wins that we got in space this year, that required a little bit of CapEx. So you wanted to put $35 million growth in CapEx, and then there are some cash tax refunds that we've got in '19 from overpayments in fiscal '18 that we discussed earlier, and that's a headwind as well and that won't repeat. So you put all that together, we feel good about the $1 billion. But as we look further out, Jon, and look into fiscal '20, and the big onetime item that we have in fiscal '19 is this $90 million of cash tax benefit from pension prefunding. As we look at fiscal '20, we think there's several offsets to that. The biggest being, we have not yet recovered the Exelis restructuring outflows that we had from the government. It's a proposal to submit the restructuring proposal. It's a multiyear approval process, and we start recovering all the money that we have previously spent, and we recovered that through our cost-plus program. So there's a little bit of outflow in Exelis restructuring that's still happening in the $10 million to $15 million range, that kind of goes away. We do think that CapEx is a tailwind in fiscal '20 because a lot of the program CapEx will be kind of behind us. Also, the ERP implementation starts winding down. And then we're working on several other cash tax savings projects that we kicked off this year, and that will start delivering results in fiscal '20. So you can put all of that together, there's enough to offset the $90 million of onetime benefit that we'll get in fiscal '19, and then earnings drive cash flow growth in '20 and beyond."

And we shape our internal investment pipeline accordingly. So it's all very well connected to where we believe the customers are going, input from them. And I think the fact that we've been willing to step up internally has paid dividends for us. And you see that very clearly on what's happening on electronic warfare. It was an area that was under invested in by Exelis. We stepped up dramatically in electronic warfare. And now we not only positioned ourselves to retain our strong platform position on F-16, F/A-18, B-52, but also now we're starting to get into the mix for recompetes on fifth-gen aircraft and proprietary platforms that are being envisioned down the road.

First of all, budget is going to be an important driver to that. What I've seen very positively in the NDAA, which passed the House, it's supposed to be at the Senate this week. It could be signed by the President before we even get out of fiscal '18, which would be pretty unique. I think very encouraging to us as well as all the people who issue procurement decisions in the DoD if the NDAA get signed that quickly and maybe even an Appropriations bill by the end of September, that's even a possibility. So I think these are all very positive indicators. So when you look at Harris, the last time I talked about medium term as mid-single-digit growth plus, I think now it's mid- to high-single digit. You see that coming through at '19. It's really across the segments. I think a very important driver of that is going to be in the Communication Systems segment, where we do see a very strong ramp in DoD, in the tactical radio business. And we've been focusing a lot on commentary around the Army. We see the budgets growing pretty dramatically on the Army over the next 4 or 5 years. But you also see SOCOM growing, you see the Air Force being strong and you see the Marine Corps recap coming in quite substantially. So when I look at our next 5 years, we have about $5.5 billion worth of budget available to Harris in the Tactical radio side that supports our business, cumulative over the next 5 years. So that's very, very encouraging to me. We also see I think great progress on some of the platforms in both Avionics and electronic warfare. I think we're just really starting this big growth. The IDIQ and one on the F-16 EW platform internationally was for $400 million. So we booked an award for Turkey in Q4, that was 60. We had Morocco before that. We have about $1.5 billion opportunity that's ahead of us on international F-16s. F/A-18 is going to grow. The F-35 is going to grow. And again, I think we're on the front end of a nice growth trajectory on the space Classified business. So Sheila, really, as I look at the business and I see even things that have been headwinds turn to tailwinds like environmental, really across the franchise, we're seeing really good growth prospects. Some of it is driven by -- a lot of it are driven by where the budgets are growing, but I think a lot of it is driven by how well we positioned our portfolio and the differentiators we have in our products and our solutions."

When we've talked over the last year about our positioning on smallsats, we have multiple contract awards on that. That's going exceptionally well, there's some capital associated with that. And as it matures over the next 12 months or so, there's lots of other missionaries and components and capabilities that will be augmenting that smallsat mission that we're positioning ourselves on. It's all, I think, very exciting. Space Superiority is a huge growth driver for the company. I talked about our growth in that area being more than 15% this past year, and we see that continuing to grow. We think we're well positioned for opportunities [ falling ] ground control systems as well as space situational awareness. So lots of different ways we're competing on, on space superiority. And the last one is on the optics side. With Exelis, we acquired a great capability up in our Rochester facility for optics, and there is a recap of a lot of different capabilities in the space, some are RF-related and some are optics-related. And those recapitalizations sometimes require some additional capital investment. So that all goes together in some of the things we're spending our growth capital on in '19. As Rahul mentioned, we're up to about $170 million in '19. We'll see that mitigate itself a little bit going into fiscal '20, probably down around $15 million or $20 million, as we get through a lot of this sort of onetime growth capital we see in '19."

So that was from my experience at UTC and what I see other companies doing. So I think that is generally pretty good. In terms of benchmarking on ERP systems, it's hard to say, but I can tell you 20 systems today is too many and 3 is about the right number. We've got a government business, we've got a commercial business and one -- it's fairly unique, which is why we're at 3. But really, what we're doing is we're bringing people into the company in senior roles either in IT or technology or other places that have experience outside of Harris that really look at what we do and bring best practices from their experiences here, and that is what's giving us some shine in the light on some new opportunities that really are in front of us. And as I said, as I look into the future, I see as much opportunity ahead of us as I've seen we captured in the recent past. So I think the ground is pretty fertile on continuing to get better, drive efficiency and productivity really across our business in the next couple of years."

So I see no capacity limitations on the horizon in our Rochester tactical facility. And for that matter, really in any other facilities, we do a lot of optics work and some other things up in Rochester. And I don't see any limitation there. I think the spike we're seeing this year on capital is really on specific programs and program capital, not on -- basically not an infrastructure capital."

So there's some acceleration there. We see CS and Communications to continue to be at a high single-digit range. Frankly, I think, as I look back on '18 and when we started our guidance on '18 -- keep in mind we started at -- I believe it was 15% or mid-teens on DoD Tactical, and then we went up to 20 or low 20s and we ended at 35%. So I'm not so sure I'm really sort of calling it accurate. Really, I think we're being more conservative than aggressive in our assumptions. And hopefully, we're in the same place today in '19, and hopefully, beyond there as well. As we see opportunities placed -- put on order a lot faster than we saw over last couple of years, and this is a pretty remarkable phenomenon, orders are being placed, dollars are being obligated at a much faster rate, not just in DoD, but also in the intelligence community, certainly from where we were a year or 2 ago. And that's been a very positive surprise. And like I said, the NDAA getting approved out of the House and maybe even getting approved by the President before we even hit September is pretty unique. And I think what's happening with things like that happening, it gives you encouragement to people who issue procurement decisions to obligate dollars faster. Their confidence goes up. So I continue to see opportunities in '19 and beyond. So what's medium term? Medium term to us is 3 to 4 years because I look at it and we look at our positioning, the amount of unused dollars that aren't yet committed where the budgets are growing. And what we see in the budgets that we can actually see over the next 5 years, there's a lot of opportunity to continue really robust growth across Harris going out in that 3-, 4-, 5-year period, Rob."

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segmen",1408,"Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segments and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.6%. 
For the year, earnings per share was up 18% to $6.50 on 5% revenue growth, and we generated record free cash flow of $915 million, 116% of net income. Orders were up 18% and increased by double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, ending the year up 23% with a book-to-bill of 1.2 and backlog up 26%, all driven by our multiyear investment in innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates and an improving budget environment.
Rahul will walk through the details of the quarter and full year financial results, but I want to take a moment to just recap the highlights of the year on Slide 4. Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 9% from strength in DoD Tactical and Night Vision. DoD Tactical revenue was up 46% in the quarter and 35% for the year, driven by more than $100 million of readiness demand from the Army and the Air Force to support deployment of security forces overseas with upgraded software-defined radios. Order momentum was even stronger, up 81% for the year to support readiness and the ramp of modernization programs. Notable wins include the first LRIP order for the Army HMS Manpack; additional orders from the Marine Corps for Manpack radios with MUOS capability; and a $765 million sole-source IDIQ for Navy and Marine Corps Falcon III and NextGen radios, double the previous contract and aligned with the budget request for Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years.
We were also awarded a sole-source 5-year $130 million IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link radio to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, representing the successful execution of our strategy to penetrate adjacent markets like tactical ISR.
International Tactical also performed well with revenue up 10% for the quarter and down less than 1% for the year, as increased demand in the Middle East and Africa to support counterterrorism activity and the ramp of the Australia modernization program in the Asia Pacific region offset the expected decline in Eastern Europe. International orders were up 25% in the year with -- which combined with a robust and diverse pipeline gives us confidence that international will return to growth in fiscal '19.
Overall for the year, Tactical ended the year stronger than we first expected with revenue up 11%, orders up 41% and backlog up 82% to about $900 million, giving us confidence in continued growth in Tactical and the broader CS segment in fiscal '19 and beyond.
In Electronic Systems, after a flattish first half due to the ADS-B transition, second half revenue growth accelerated to 9% with growth across all ES businesses and ending the year above the high end of our 5% guidance range. The key driver was long-term platforms like the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, which collectively grew by more than 20% as a result of technology upgrades, ramped production and increased content. Two international programs, U.K. Robotics and the UAE battle management, also contributed to strong year-over-year growth in ES.
Segment orders increased 33% to $3.1 billion with more than -- which -- and more than doubled to over $1 billion on the F-35, the F/A-18 and the F-16 platforms. In June, we were awarded a $400 million sole-sourced IDIQ to supply electronic warfare systems for international F-16s. It's a key gating item as we work towards capturing an estimated $1.5 billion opportunity. 
On the F/A-18, we had our best orders year on record and we received 2 awards totaling $320 million to supply electronic jammers to protect U.S. and international F/A-18 against electronic threats, supporting multiyear growth on this important platform.
We continue to make progress on international pursuits, successfully delivering our first 2 robotic systems for explosive ordinance disposal missions to the U.K. MoD. Achieving this milestone is important as we pursue other international opportunities in the upcoming U.S. DoD Common Robotic System competition. We also leveraged our FAA managed services model to capture a 15-year $141 million contract in the quarter to modernize India's air traffic management communications infrastructure, supporting growth in one of the world's largest aviation markets.
Overall for Electronic Systems, book-to-bill was 1.3 for the year and backlog increased 30% to $2.6 billion. This, combined with a $17 billion pipeline and $4.5 billion in proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will continue to accelerate in fiscal '19.
In Space and Intel, revenue was up 1% for the year as growth in classified programs from the ramp of smallsats, ground-based adjacencies and space surveillance programs offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. Investments in R&D and innovation ahead of the customer needs resulted in double-digit growth in classified orders for the year as we strengthened our global leadership in hosted payloads, increased our share of wallet with existing customers and expanded our addressable market from components to now full-mission solutions.
Orders for the segment grew 6% and book-to-bill was slightly greater than 1 for the year. With about 80% of fiscal '19, revenue and backlog [ and ] high-confidence follow-on opportunities, a $14 billion pipeline, continued strength in classified space and decreasing headwinds on our environmental programs, we now expect mid-single-digit growth for the segment in fiscal '19.
We continue to maintain best-in-class margins and generate a record free cash flow of $915 million, returning about $550 million to shareholders. We also achieved our post-Exelis debt-reduction commitment of $2 billion and prefunded our pension plan to about 90% with no required contributions until 2025, creating future cash flow flexibility.
But our strong operation performance wouldn't be possible without a relentless focus on operational excellence. This program we call Harris Business Excellence or HBX. HBX is an integral part of the Harris' culture of continuous improvement, and it's contributed to successes across the enterprise. For example, in Night Vision over the last 2 years, we've improved yield and on-time delivery while lowering cost, resulting in significant margin expansion and double-digit growth. This business has moved from being a watched area when we acquired Exelis to a growth driver, and the improved returns gave us the room to increase investment to compete on upcoming U.S. and international modernization programs.
On the F-35 program, we've delivered over a million parts with greater than 99.95% on-time delivery, and we received the Outstanding Supplier Award in our weapons release factory in Amityville. Operational performance and the commitment to innovation has driven increased content per shipset with opportunities to expand it further in the future. And on the F/A-18 IDECM program, it is a franchise with more than $1 billion in orders to date, we've cut factory cycle time by 10% and have been recognized by the Navy for maintaining a 100% on-time delivery record over the past 20 years.
In Space and Intel, you've heard me speak about improved execution on the SENSOR program, and we continue to make progress with on-time delivery increasing from 35% when we acquired Exelis to 90% today, driving 15% revenue growth on the program just this past year.
And finally on GPS III, we corrected the legacy issues and established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering the fifth payload in March, with number 6 through 8 expected by early next year.
And now with the recently developed fully digital mission data unit, we're well positioned for the upcoming GPS IIIF award and maintaining incumbency.
Overall, we've had an exceptional year in which we returned to growth and generated record earnings per share and free cash flow, meeting or exceeding the targets we set for ourselves. For fiscal '19, we expect to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, accelerating growth in all 3 segments, increasing margins and maximizing cash. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $7.65 to $7.85 on revenue growth of 6% to 8% and to achieve our $1 billion free cash flow goal.
Let me now turn it over to Rahul to walk through our financial results and additional details of fiscal '19 guidance before I close with a few comments on our medium-term outlook. Rahul?"

As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 11% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 50 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19% or $0.29, and excluding the benefit of tax reform, was up 12% or $0.18. Free cash flow was a record $464 million for the quarter.
Turning to the full year EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 18% or $0.97. The expected $0.21 headwind from the ADS-B program transition was offset by disciplined capital deployment. Half of the EPS growth was from higher volume in Tactical Communications, Avionics and Classified space. Solid program execution, productivity and higher pension income offset by lower environmental volume and program mix. The other half came from a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform.
On Slide 7. Communication systems revenue in the quarter was $523 million, up 16% versus the prior year with growth across all the 3 businesses in the segment. In addition to the strong growth of 21% in Tactical, Night Vision revenue was a gain of double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 11%, to $162 million from higher volume and operational efficiencies. Operating margin remained strong at 31% and orders were up 6%, growing for the eighth consecutive quarter. For the full year, revenue and operating income each increased 9% with operating margin of 30%. Segment orders increased 28%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and greater than 1 in each of the 3 businesses in the segment. We've continued to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog, as supplemental information at the end of the presentation.
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $640 million, up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in Avionics, electronic warfare and C4ISR. Segment operating income increased 14% to $119 million from higher volume and strong operational performance. Orders grew double digits for the fifth straight quarter, up 38% with a book-to-bill of 1.3. For the full year, segment revenue was up 5% and operating margin was at 18.6% as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program transition, incremental investment and shifts in program revenue mix.
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence, revenue for the fourth quarter was up 0.4% and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 110 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. For the full year, revenue was up 1% as continued growth in classified programs was partially offset by an expected decline in environmental programs revenue. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.5%.
Switching to guidance for fiscal '19. We have adopted a new revenue recognition standards, ASC 606, using the full retrospective method effective at the beginning of fiscal '19. Adopting the new standard requires adjusting the timing of recognition of revenue and associated program costs for a few contracts, treatment of certain expenses, but does not materially impact the total financial results. Our guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standard, and the preliminary recast of historical financials are included as supplemental information on Slide 16.
For fiscal '19, the revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% over the recasted fiscal '18 base, which is $11 million lower than the reported numbers. So not a material impact. The growth in the year is driven by continued DoD Tactical modernization as well as growth across electronic warfare, avionics, battle management and classified space programs. We expect total company EBIT margins to be between 19.3% and 19.7% from strong growth in higher-margin Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments.
Fiscal '19 EPS is expected to be between $7.65 and $7.85 and includes a placeholder of $400 million for share repurchases and an effective tax rate of 17%. We expect to generate greater than or equal to $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '19, reflecting higher earnings and cash tax benefit from pension prefunding, partially offset by increased working capital, higher capital expenditures and the timing of tax payments. We ended fiscal '18 with working capital of 42 days, a 1-day improvement over 2017, and 2019 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance. 
Capital expenditures grew by approximately $35 million to $170 million to support new program starts. We are expecting accelerated growth in each of the segments in fiscal '19. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up between 8% and 10% with DoD Tactical up mid- to high-teens, Night Vision up double digits and international tactical and public safety up low to mid-single digits.
Modernization growth in DoD Tactical will primarily occur in the second half of the fiscal year, as we start to ship Manpacks for the Army and ramp up production and deliveries of handhelds for SOCOM and the Army. 
Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the diluted margin impact of new program starts and incremental systems work that is more than offset by the benefits from operational excellence and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be up between 7% and 8%, driven by strong growth in Avionics and electronic warfare as fiscal '18 backlog converts to revenue and the continued ramp of UAE battle management program. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 18% and 19% as growth from lower-margin program is offset by operational excellence.
In Space and Intelligence, revenue is expected to be up between 4% and 5%. Classified business, representing about 2/3 of the segment is expected to grow high single digits, partially offset by continued modest weakness in environmental programs, which we expect to reach a trough this fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the volume increase and operational efficiencies.
Fiscal '19 EPS bridge on Slide 11. EPS is expected to grow between $1.15 and $1.35 from higher volume across the 3 segments; operational efficiencies; lower tax rate, including the benefit of tax reform; and accretive capital deployment.
And with that, let me turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin busines",543,"Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, successfully integrated Exelis and made disciplined investments in the business that led to several new product launches and strategic program wins. We also derisked the balance sheet to give us more financial flexibility. Fiscal '18 was an inflection point for Harris as we return to growth and grew backlog significantly. This, combined with a more favorable budget environment, especially in strategic growth areas, positioned us well to accelerate growth in fiscal '19 and the medium term.
At this time last year, I laid out the medium-term growth drivers by segment, as shown on Slide 14. And over the past year, we've seen the outlook improve in each of them. Communication and electronic systems are now expected to grow high single digits and space and intel at mid-single digits. The higher end of the medium-term range for all 3 segments that we indicated this time last year. In Tactical, we're beginning to see the DoD modernization ramp across all the services, and international has stabilized and is returning to growth as we leverage our incumbency and large installed base and benefit from higher defense spending by coalition partners.
In Electronic Systems, Avionics and electronic warfare are entering a multiyear growth cycle, driven by our position on long-term platforms. And in Space and Intel, classified growth will accelerate, as we maintain high win rates and expand into adjacencies in a growing budget environment, and the headwinds in the environmental business now become tailwinds.
We've been on a multiyear journey to improve margins. And while we made progress in driving productivity and efficiency in recent years, I see much more opportunity in front of us. We're now halfway through standardizing our systems that will reduce the number of ERP platforms from 28 to 3, simplifying our operating environment, driving productivity through growth and shared services, automating core processes and laying the foundation of our enterprise-wide digital strategy. By the end of this year, we will have eliminated 80% of our data centers, and by fiscal '21, the remainder will be fully cloud-enabled.
We recently hired a new Chief Technology Officer, who's fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of every R&D dollar we invest. We're fully deploying dev ops to streamline software development, which has grown to be more than 40% of our engineering work today and is expected to increase over time. And we continue to squeeze more cost savings out of our supply chain through value engineering and [ should cause ] analysis on new products and improving supplier performance and reducing sole-source components on legacy solutions.
Taking together, this relentless focus on operational excellence combined with the leverage on incremental volume that will drive margin expansion in communication and Electronic Systems as well as for Harris as a whole.
In summary, we expect higher revenue, higher margin, double-digit earnings-per-share growth and sustained cash generation through the medium term. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But as we see growth in our segments, especially in our space and environmental -- in our Electronic Systems business, some new wins like the Classified business is coming in at lower-than-average segment margins, and that's growing pretty healthily.

And of course, over in the Communication Systems segment and Tactical, as we see the ramp of modernization programs, as we said before on this call, we'll see those programs coming in at slightly lower than segment or normal Tactical margins, but improving over time as we continue to take cost out of the product as we've done many times in the past."

In fact, having a new CTO on the team over the last year is really helping us dig in a lot more into where we're spending our money and where we shouldn't be spending our money going forward. I mean, you're right. Over the last couple of years, we've raised our investment in IRAD. This year, we closed at just over 5% of revenue, which is above where everyone else in the segment the peers happen to be. It's going to go up again a little bit in fiscal '20. When tax reform was enacted, we took our fiscal '18 number up about $20 million because we saw new opportunities in things like robotics that we invested in. So we continue to look at how we spend money, we look at the return on different programs, we look at how we leverage capabilities across the company. Lots of places around Harris invest in various features of software or waveforms, and we're thinking about how do we leverage the investments we have across the company in a more productive way. So that is one of the things our CTO is helping us think about, as I go out a year or 2 or 3 from here, I don't think we'll be substantially higher than -- as a percentage of revenue. So I see it neither as a margin drag nor tailwind on our margins. But if we continue to find good opportunities to invest, invest ahead of the curve, invest ahead of where the customers are going to go. And I think as you look at the results we're pointing out today in very good growth, it really does come from some of the IRAD investments we've made in the last 3 or 4 years."

A lot of the defense companies have not, and that is going to compress the cycle time for software pretty substantially. We've seen that in multiple cases where we deployed dev ops.

So in 2019, our net income is up about $140 million and we kept the cash tax benefit of about $90 million from the pension funding that we did or prefunding that we did back in '18, and that's getting partially offset by increase in working capital of about $30 million to $40 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days come down by 1 day, but we still -- because of revenue growth, we still see some drag on working capital. So there's about $35 million of CapEx growth, and that's primarily to fund new program starts like the FTI India win that Bill mentioned. Our ERP investment is a multiyear investment, a little bit of step-up in that as well. Classified wins that we got in space this year, that required a little bit of CapEx. So there's about $35 million growth in CapEx, and then there are some cash tax refunds that we've got in '19 from overpayments in fiscal '18 that we discussed earlier, and that's a headwind as well and that won't repeat. So you put all that together, we feel good about the $1 billion. But as we look further out, Jon, and look into fiscal '20, and the big onetime item that we have in fiscal '19 is this $90 million of cash tax benefit from pension prefunding. As we look at fiscal '20, we think there's several offsets to that. The biggest being, we have not yet recovered the Exelis restructuring outflows that we had from the government. It's a proposal [ we have submitted ] the restructuring proposal. It's a multiyear approval process, and we start recovering all the money that we have previously spent, and we recovered that through our cost-plus program. So there's a little bit of outflow in Exelis restructuring that's still happening in the $10 million to $15 million range, that kind of goes away. We do think that CapEx is a tailwind in fiscal '20 because a lot of the program CapEx will be kind of behind us. Also, the ERP implementation starts winding down. And then we're working on several other cash tax savings projects that we kicked off this year, and that will start delivering results in fiscal '20. So you can put all of that together, there's enough to offset the $90 million of onetime benefit that we'll get in fiscal '19, and then earnings drive cash flow growth in '20 and beyond."

We don't make investments in R&D internally without really understanding the business case, understanding where the customer is going, the messages that we're hearing from them. And we shape our internal investment pipeline accordingly. So it's all very well connected to where we believe the customers are going, input from them. And I think the fact that we've been willing to step up internally has paid dividends for us. And you see that very clearly on what's happening on electronic warfare. It was an area that was under invested in by Exelis. We stepped up dramatically in electronic warfare. And now we not only positioned ourselves to retain our strong platform position on F-16, F/A-18, B-52, but also now we're starting to get into the mix for recompetes on fifth-gen aircraft and proprietary platforms that are being envisioned down the road. So I think one good example of where we're hearing the message, shaping our investments, and I think we're investing smartly on behalf of share-owners. So it's all -- I think it's all pretty tightly connected, and again our new CTO is going to help us shape it even further in the next couple of years."

First of all, budget is going to be an important driver to that. What I've seen very positively in the NDAA, which passed the House, it's supposed to be at the Senate this week. It could be signed by the President before we even get out of fiscal '18, which would be pretty unique. I think very encouraging to us as well as to all the people who issue procurement decisions in the DoD if the NDAA get signed that quickly and maybe even an Appropriations bill by the end of September, that's even a possibility. So I think these are all very positive indicators. So when you look at Harris, the last time I talked about medium term as mid-single-digit growth plus, I think now it's mid- to high-single digit. You see that coming through in '19. It's really across the segments. I think a very important driver of that is going to be in the Communication Systems segment, where we do see a very strong ramp in DoD, in the tactical radio business. And we've been focusing a lot on commentary around the Army. We see the budgets growing pretty dramatically on the Army over the next 4 or 5 years. But you also see SOCOM growing, you see the Air Force being strong and you see the Marine Corps recap coming in quite substantially. So when I look at our next 5 years, there is about $5.5 billion worth of budget available to Harris in the Tactical radio side that supports our business, cumulative over the next 5 years. So that's very, very encouraging to me. We also see I think great progress on some of the platforms in both Avionics and electronic warfare. I think we're just really starting this big growth. The IDIQ we won on the F-16 EW platform internationally was for $400 million. So we booked an award for Turkey in Q4, that was 60. We had Morocco before that. We have about $1.5 billion opportunity that's ahead of us on international F-16s. F/A-18 is going to grow. The F-35 is going to grow. And again, I think we're on the front end of a nice growth trajectory on the space Classified business. So Sheila, really, as I look at the business and I see even things that have been headwinds turn to tailwinds like environmental, really across the franchise, I see really good growth prospects. Some of it is driven by -- a lot of it is driven by where the budgets are growing, but I think a lot of it is driven by how well we positioned our portfolio and the differentiators we have in our products and our solutions."

We talked the last quarter about $0.5 billion exquisite win that we have to a prime on a mission area that we've had some experience on. It's going to deliver over the next 5, 6 years. Our piece of that is more -- probably more front-end loaded. There's some capital associated with that program. When we've talked over the last year about our positioning on smallsats, we have multiple contract awards on that. That's going exceptionally well, there's some capital associated with that. And as it matures over the next 12 months or so, there's lots of other mission areas and components and capabilities that will be augmenting that smallsat mission that we're positioning ourselves on. It's all, I think, very exciting. Space Superiority is a huge growth driver for the company. I talked about our growth in that area being more than 15% this past year, and we see that continuing to grow. We think we're well positioned for opportunities [ falling ] ground control systems as well as space situational awareness. So lots of different ways we're competing on, on space superiority. And the last one is on the optics side. With Exelis, we acquired a great capability up in our Rochester facility for optics, and there is a recap of a lot of different capabilities in the space, some are RF-related and some are optics-related. And those recapitalizations sometimes require some additional capital investment. So that all goes together in some of the things we're spending our growth capital on in '19. As Rahul mentioned, we're up to about $170 million in '19. We'll see that mitigate itself a little bit going into fiscal '20, probably down around $15 million or $20 million, as we get through a lot of this sort of onetime growth capital we see in '19."

And we've been running towards the high end of that 2.5% to 3% range really over the last 5 or 6 years, and I expect that to continue and maybe even go above that over the next several years. What's driving it is changing over time, of course, supply chain is important and there's some engineering productivities, labor productivity in our factory. But even through Exelis integration, we continue to see, on top of the savings from Exelis integration, opportunities to just get better every day at what we do, and that's going to be continuation. So that was from my experience at UTC and what I see other companies doing. So I think that is generally pretty good. In terms of benchmarking on ERP systems, it's hard to say, but I can tell you 20 systems today is too many and 3 is about the right number. We've got a government business, we've got a commercial business and one -- it's fairly unique, which is why we're at 3. But really, what we're doing is we're bringing people into the company in senior roles either in IT or technology or other places that have experience outside of Harris that really look at what we do and bring best practices from their experiences here, and that is what's giving us some shining the light on some new opportunities that really are in front of us. And as I said, as I look into the future, I see as much opportunity ahead of us as I've seen we captured in the recent past. So I think the ground is pretty fertile on continuing to get better, drive efficiency and productivity really across our business in the next couple of years."

So I'm not so sure I'm really sort of calling it accurately. I think we're being more conservative than aggressive in our assumptions. And hopefully, we're in the same place today in '19, and hopefully, beyond there as well. As we see opportunities placed -- put on order a lot faster than we saw over last couple of years, and this is a pretty remarkable phenomenon, orders are being placed, dollars are being obligated at a much faster rate, not just in DoD, but also in the intelligence community, certainly from where we were a year or 2 ago. And that's been a very positive surprise. And like I said, the NDAA getting approved out of the House and maybe even getting approved by the President before we even hit September is pretty unique. And I think what's happening with things like that happening, it gives encouragement to people who issue procurement decisions to obligate dollars faster. Their confidence goes up. So I continue to see opportunities in '19 and beyond. So what's medium term? Medium term to us is 3 to 4 years, as I look at it and we look at our positioning, the amount of unused dollars that aren't yet committed where the budgets are growing. And what we see in the budgets that we can actually see over the next 5 years, there's a lot of opportunity to continue really robust growth across Harris going out in that 3-, 4-, 5-year period, Rob."

Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segmen",1408,"Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal '18 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share of 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 7 years. Revenue was once again up in all segments and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.6%. 
For the year, earnings per share was up 18% to $6.50 on 5% revenue growth, and we generated record free cash flow of $915 million, 116% of net income. Orders were up 18% and increased by double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, ending the year up 23% with a book-to-bill of 1.2 and backlog up 26%, all driven by our multiyear investment in innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates and an improving budget environment.
Rahul will walk through the details of the quarter and full year financial results, but I want to take a moment to just recap the highlights of the year on Slide 4. Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 9% from strength in DoD Tactical and Night Vision. DoD Tactical revenue was up 46% in the quarter and 35% for the year, driven by more than $100 million of readiness demand from the Army and the Air Force to support deployment of security forces overseas with upgraded software-defined radios. Order momentum was even stronger, up 81% for the year to support readiness and the ramp of modernization programs. Notable wins include the first LRIP order for the Army HMS Manpack; additional orders from the Marine Corps for Manpack radios with MUOS capability; and a $765 million sole-source IDIQ for Navy and Marine Corps Falcon III and NextGen radios, double the previous contract and aligned with the budget request for Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years.
We were also awarded a sole-source 5-year $130 million IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link radio to provide airborne-collected ISR information to forces on the ground, representing the successful execution of our strategy to penetrate adjacent markets like tactical ISR.
International Tactical also performed well with revenue up 10% for the quarter and down less than 1% for the year, as increased demand in the Middle East and Africa to support counterterrorism activity and the ramp of the Australia modernization program in the Asia Pacific region offset the expected decline in Eastern Europe. International orders were up 25% in the year with -- which combined with a robust and diverse pipeline gives us confidence that international will return to growth in fiscal '19.
Overall for the year, Tactical ended the year stronger than we first expected with revenue up 11%, orders up 41% and backlog up 82% to about $900 million, giving us confidence in continued growth in Tactical and the broader CS segment in fiscal '19 and beyond.
In Electronic Systems, after a flattish first half due to the ADS-B transition, second half revenue growth accelerated to 9% with growth across all ES businesses and ending the year above the high end of our 5% guidance range. The key driver was long-term platforms like the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, which collectively grew by more than 20% as a result of technology upgrades, ramped production and increased content. Two international programs, U.K. Robotics and the UAE battle management, also contributed to strong year-over-year growth in ES.
Segment orders increased 33% to $3.1 billion with more than -- which -- and more than doubled to over $1 billion on the F-35, the F/A-18 and the F-16 platforms. In June, we were awarded a $400 million sole-sourced IDIQ to supply electronic warfare systems for international F-16s. It's a key gating item as we work towards capturing an estimated $1.5 billion opportunity. 
On the F/A-18, we had our best orders year on record and we received 2 awards totaling $320 million to supply electronic jammers to protect U.S. and international F/A-18 against electronic threats, supporting multiyear growth on this important platform.
We continue to make progress on international pursuits, successfully delivering our first 2 robotic systems for explosive ordinance disposal missions to the U.K. MoD. Achieving this milestone is important as we pursue other international opportunities in the upcoming U.S. DoD Common Robotic System competition. We also leveraged our FAA managed services model to capture a 15-year $141 million contract in the quarter to modernize India's air traffic management communications infrastructure, supporting growth in one of the world's largest aviation markets.
Overall for Electronic Systems, book-to-bill was 1.3 for the year and backlog increased 30% to $2.6 billion. This, combined with a $17 billion pipeline and $4.5 billion in proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will continue to accelerate in fiscal '19.
In Space and Intel, revenue was up 1% for the year as growth in classified programs from the ramp of smallsats, ground-based adjacencies and space surveillance programs offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. Investments in R&D and innovation ahead of the customer needs resulted in double-digit growth in classified orders for the year as we strengthened our global leadership in hosted payloads, increased our share of wallet with existing customers and expanded our addressable market from components to now full-mission solutions.
Orders for the segment grew 6% and book-to-bill was slightly greater than 1 for the year. With about 80% of fiscal '19, revenue and backlog [ and ] high-confidence follow-on opportunities, a $14 billion pipeline, continued strength in classified space and decreasing headwinds on our environmental programs, we now expect mid-single-digit growth for the segment in fiscal '19.
We continue to maintain best-in-class margins and generate a record free cash flow of $915 million, returning about $550 million to shareholders. We also achieved our post-Exelis debt-reduction commitment of $2 billion and prefunded our pension plan to about 90% with no required contributions until 2025, creating future cash flow flexibility.
But our strong operation performance wouldn't be possible without a relentless focus on operational excellence. This program we call Harris Business Excellence or HBX. HBX is an integral part of the Harris' culture of continuous improvement, and it's contributed to successes across the enterprise. For example, in Night Vision over the last 2 years, we've improved yield and on-time delivery while lowering cost, resulting in significant margin expansion and double-digit growth. This business has moved from being a watched area when we acquired Exelis to a growth driver, and the improved returns gave us the room to increase investment to compete on upcoming U.S. and international modernization programs.
On the F-35 program, we've delivered over a million parts with greater than 99.95% on-time delivery, and we received the Outstanding Supplier Award in our weapons release factory in Amityville. Operational performance and the commitment to innovation has driven increased content per shipset with opportunities to expand it further in the future. And on the F/A-18 IDECM program, it is a franchise with more than $1 billion in orders to date, we've cut factory cycle time by 10% and have been recognized by the Navy for maintaining a 100% on-time delivery record over the past 20 years.
In Space and Intel, you've heard me speak about improved execution on the SENSOR program, and we continue to make progress with on-time delivery increasing from 35% when we acquired Exelis to 90% today, driving 15% revenue growth on the program just this past year.
And finally on GPS III, we corrected the legacy issues and established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering the fifth payload in March, with number 6 through 8 expected by early next year.
And now with the recently developed fully digital mission data unit, we're well positioned for the upcoming GPS IIIF award and maintaining incumbency.
Overall, we've had an exceptional year in which we returned to growth and generated record earnings per share and free cash flow, meeting or exceeding the targets we set for ourselves. For fiscal '19, we expect to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, accelerating growth in all 3 segments, increasing margins and maximizing cash. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $7.65 to $7.85 on revenue growth of 6% to 8% and to achieve our $1 billion free cash flow goal.
Let me now turn it over to Rahul to walk through our financial results and additional details of fiscal '19 guidance before I close with a few comments on our medium-term outlook. Rahul?"

Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased",1054,"Thank you,  Bill, and good morning, everyone. Starting with total company results on Slide 5. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude onetime adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 11% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 50 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19% or $0.29, and excluding the benefit of tax reform, was up 12% or $0.18. Free cash flow was a record $464 million for the quarter.
Turning to the full year EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 18% or $0.97. The expected $0.21 headwind from the ADS-B program transition was offset by disciplined capital deployment. Half of the EPS growth was from higher volume in Tactical Communications, Avionics and Classified space. Solid program execution, productivity and higher pension income offset by lower environmental volume and program mix. The other half came from a lower tax rate, including the benefit from tax reform.
On Slide 7. Communication systems revenue in the quarter was $523 million, up 16% versus the prior year with growth across all the 3 businesses in the segment. In addition to the strong growth of 21% in Tactical, Night Vision revenue was a gain of double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 11%, to $162 million from higher volume and operational efficiencies. Operating margin remained strong at 31% and orders were up 6%, growing for the eighth consecutive quarter. For the full year, revenue and operating income each increased 9% with operating margin of 30%. Segment orders increased 28%, book-to-bill was 1.3 and greater than 1 in each of the 3 businesses in the segment. We've continued to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog, as supplemental information at the end of the presentation.
On Slide 8. Electronic Systems revenue was $640 million, up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in Avionics, electronic warfare and C4ISR. Segment operating income increased 14% to $119 million from higher volume and strong operational performance. Orders grew double digits for the fifth straight quarter, up 38% with a book-to-bill of 1.3. For the full year, segment revenue was up 5% and operating margin was at 18.6% as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program transition, incremental investment and shifts in program revenue mix.
On Slide 9. In Space and Intelligence, revenue for the fourth quarter was up 0.4% and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 110 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. For the full year, revenue was up 1% as continued growth in classified programs was partially offset by an expected decline in environmental programs revenue. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.5%.
Switching to guidance for fiscal '19. We have adopted a new revenue recognition standards, ASC 606, using the full retrospective method effective at the beginning of fiscal '19. Adopting the new standard requires adjusting the timing of recognition of revenue and associated program costs for a few contracts, treatment of certain expenses, but does not materially impact the total financial results. Our guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standard, and the preliminary recast of historical financials are included as supplemental information on Slide 16.
For fiscal '19, the revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% over the recasted fiscal '18 base, which is $11 million lower than the reported numbers. So not a material impact. The growth in the year is driven by continued DoD Tactical modernization as well as growth across electronic warfare, avionics, battle management and classified space programs. We expect total company EBIT margins to be between 19.3% and 19.7% from strong growth in higher-margin Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments.
Fiscal '19 EPS is expected to be between $7.65 and $7.85 and includes a placeholder of $400 million for share repurchases and an effective tax rate of 17%. We expect to generate greater than or equal to $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '19, reflecting higher earnings and cash tax benefit from pension prefunding, partially offset by increased working capital, higher capital expenditures and the timing of tax payments. We ended fiscal '18 with working capital of 42 days, a 1-day improvement over 2017, and 2019 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance. 
Capital expenditures grew by approximately $35 million to $170 million to support new program starts. We are expecting accelerated growth in each of the segments in fiscal '19. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up between 8% and 10% with DoD Tactical up mid- to high-teens, Night Vision up double digits and international tactical and public safety up low to mid-single digits.
Modernization growth in DoD Tactical will primarily occur in the second half of the fiscal year, as we start to ship Manpacks for the Army and ramp up production and deliveries of handhelds for SOCOM and the Army. 
Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the diluted margin impact of new program starts and incremental systems work that is more than offset by the benefits from operational excellence and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be up between 7% and 8%, driven by strong growth in Avionics and electronic warfare as fiscal '18 backlog converts to revenue and the continued ramp of UAE battle management program. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 18% and 19% as growth from lower-margin program is offset by operational excellence.
In Space and Intelligence, revenue is expected to be up between 4% and 5%. Classified business, representing about 2/3 of the segment is expected to grow high single digits, partially offset by continued modest weakness in environmental programs, which we expect to reach a trough this fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the volume increase and operational efficiencies.
Fiscal '19 EPS bridge on Slide 11. EPS is expected to grow between $1.15 and $1.35 from higher volume across the 3 segments; operational efficiencies; lower tax rate, including the benefit of tax reform; and accretive capital deployment.
And with that, let me turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin busines",543,"Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. I want to close with a few comments on our multiyear strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium term. As we recap on Slide 12, in recent years, we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, successfully integrated Exelis and made disciplined investments in the business that led to several new product launches and strategic program wins. We also derisked the balance sheet to give us more financial flexibility. Fiscal '18 was an inflection point for Harris as we return to growth and grew backlog significantly. This, combined with a more favorable budget environment, especially in strategic growth areas, positioned us well to accelerate growth in fiscal '19 and the medium term.
At this time last year, I laid out the medium-term growth drivers by segment, as shown on Slide 14. And over the past year, we've seen the outlook improve in each of them. Communication and electronic systems are now expected to grow high single digits and space and intel at mid-single digits. The higher end of the medium-term range for all 3 segments that we indicated this time last year. In Tactical, we're beginning to see the DoD modernization ramp across all the services, and international has stabilized and is returning to growth as we leverage our incumbency and large installed base and benefit from higher defense spending by coalition partners.
In Electronic Systems, Avionics and electronic warfare are entering a multiyear growth cycle, driven by our position on long-term platforms. And in Space and Intel, classified growth will accelerate, as we maintain high win rates and expand into adjacencies in a growing budget environment, and the headwinds in the environmental business now become tailwinds.
We've been on a multiyear journey to improve margins. And while we made progress in driving productivity and efficiency in recent years, I see much more opportunity in front of us. We're now halfway through standardizing our systems that will reduce the number of ERP platforms from 28 to 3, simplifying our operating environment, driving productivity through growth and shared services, automating core processes and laying the foundation of our enterprise-wide digital strategy. By the end of this year, we will have eliminated 80% of our data centers, and by fiscal '21, the remainder will be fully cloud-enabled.
We recently hired a new Chief Technology Officer, who's fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of every R&D dollar we invest. We're fully deploying dev ops to streamline software development, which has grown to be more than 40% of our engineering work today and is expected to increase over time. And we continue to squeeze more cost savings out of our supply chain through value engineering and [ should cause ] analysis on new products and improving supplier performance and reducing sole-source components on legacy solutions.
Taking together, this relentless focus on operational excellence combined with the leverage on incremental volume that will drive margin expansion in communication and Electronic Systems as well as for Harris as a whole.
In summary, we expect higher revenue, higher margin, double-digit earnings-per-share growth and sustained cash generation through the medium term. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But as we see growth in our segments, especially in our space and environmental -- in our Electronic Systems business, some new wins like the Classified business is coming in at lower-than-average segment margins, and that's growing pretty healthily. That will bring down the SIS segment a little bit, again offset by operational excellence. And of course, over in the Communication Systems segment and Tactical, as we see the ramp of modernization programs, as we said before on this call, we'll see those programs coming in at slightly lower than segment or normal Tactical margins, but improving over time as we continue to take cost out of the product as we've done many times in the past."

And given our progress so far on EW and the work we've done through software-defined EW, a big investment over the last several years, small size [ and weight in ] power systems, really improvements in cognitive and the algorithms we have, we think we'll be a player there if they decide to move down the path and recompete that.

But if I go out into '19 -- into fiscal '20, I think we should be approaching and not hitting 20%. So we believe with the maturity of our operational excellence program, some of the actions and steps we're taking today. And the way we're going to take cost out of new product launches like in Tactical over the next 12 to 18 months, we're pretty confident of margin expansion in '20 and beyond."

So the funding that's supporting the overall Tactical business is very, very strong, including the HMS Manpack. We're doing well. We had a delivery order in LRIP, delivery order for 1,129 units that will be delivered in fiscal '19. We expect that we'll see another LRIP order probably in the back half of our fiscal '19 of some size, leading into operational testing in fiscal '20. So it is all playing out I think very well. It's moving forward as we'd expected. The budget is there, the Army is moving the program.

In fact, having a new CTO on the team over the last year is really helping us dig in a lot more into where we're spending our money and where we shouldn't be spending our money going forward. I mean, you're right. Over the last couple of years, we've raised our investment in IRAD. This year, we closed at just over 5% of revenue, which is above where everyone else in the segment the peers happen to be. It's going to go up again a little bit in fiscal '20. When tax reform was enacted, we took our fiscal '18 number up about $20 million because we saw new opportunities in things like robotics that we invested in. So we continue to look at how we spend money, we look at the return on different programs, we look at how we leverage capabilities across the company. Lots of places around Harris invest in various features of software or waveforms, and we're thinking about how do we leverage the investments we have across the company in a more productive way. So that is one of the things our CTO is helping us think about, as I go out a year or 2 or 3 from here, I don't think we'll be substantially higher than -- as a percentage of revenue. So I see it neither as a margin drag nor tailwind on our margins. But if we continue to find good opportunities to invest, invest ahead of the curve, invest ahead of where the customers are going to go. And I think as you look at the results we're pointing out today in very good growth, it really does come from some of the IRAD investments we've made in the last 3 or 4 years."

The concept is basically be able to integrate your -- continuously integrate and test software builds so that you  always have a software feature that you can field and market, and that is something that we have not developed. A lot of the defense companies have not, and that is going to compress the cycle time for software pretty substantially. We've seen that in multiple cases where we deployed dev ops. As we go out the next 2 to 3 years, by fiscal '21, we think 85% or 90% of our new starts will be on dev ops.

So in 2019, our net income is up about $140 million and we kept the cash tax benefit of about $90 million from the pension funding that we did or prefunding that we did back in '18, and that's getting partially offset by increase in working capital of about $30 million to $40 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days come down by 1 day, but we still -- because of revenue growth, we still see some drag on working capital. So there's about $35 million of CapEx growth, and that's primarily to fund new program starts like the FTI India win that Bill mentioned. Our ERP investment is a multiyear investment, a little bit of step-up in that as well. Classified wins that we got in space this year, that required a little bit of CapEx. So there's about $35 million growth in CapEx, and then there are some cash tax refunds that we've got in '19 from overpayments in fiscal '18 that we discussed earlier, and that's a headwind as well and that won't repeat. So you put all that together, we feel good about the $1 billion. But as we look further out, Jon, and look into fiscal '20, and the big onetime item that we have in fiscal '19 is this $90 million of cash tax benefit from pension prefunding. As we look at fiscal '20, we think there's several offsets to that. The biggest being, we have not yet recovered the Exelis restructuring outflows that we had from the government. It's a proposal [ we have submitted ] the restructuring proposal. It's a multiyear approval process, and we start recovering all the money that we have previously spent, and we recovered that through our cost-plus program. So there's a little bit of outflow in Exelis restructuring that's still happening in the $10 million to $15 million range, that kind of goes away. We do think that CapEx is a tailwind in fiscal '20 because a lot of the program CapEx will be kind of behind us. Also, the ERP implementation starts winding down. And then we're working on several other cash tax savings projects that we kicked off this year, and that will start delivering results in fiscal '20. So you can put all of that together, there's enough to offset the $90 million of onetime benefit that we'll get in fiscal '19, and then earnings drive cash flow growth in '20 and beyond."

It was an area that was under invested in by Exelis. We stepped up dramatically in electronic warfare. And now we not only positioned ourselves to retain our strong platform position on F-16, F/A-18, B-52, but also now we're starting to get into the mix for recompetes on fifth-gen aircraft and proprietary platforms that are being envisioned down the road.

But you also see SOCOM growing, you see the Air Force being strong and you see the Marine Corps recap coming in quite substantially. So when I look at our next 5 years, there is about $5.5 billion worth of budget available to Harris in the Tactical radio side that supports our business, cumulative over the next 5 years. So that's very, very encouraging to me. We also see I think great progress on some of the platforms in both Avionics and electronic warfare. I think we're just really starting this big growth. The IDIQ we won on the F-16 EW platform internationally was for $400 million. So we booked an award for Turkey in Q4, that was 60. We had Morocco before that. We have about $1.5 billion opportunity that's ahead of us on international F-16s. F/A-18 is going to grow. The F-35 is going to grow. And again, I think we're on the front end of a nice growth trajectory on the space Classified business. So Sheila, really, as I look at the business and I see even things that have been headwinds turn to tailwinds like environmental, really across the franchise, I see really good growth prospects. Some of it is driven by -- a lot of it is driven by where the budgets are growing, but I think a lot of it is driven by how well we positioned our portfolio and the differentiators we have in our products and our solutions."

It can grow to 50%, 55%, 60%. I think where it is going to contribute to the top line, Sheila, is how good we are at ingesting and maturing dev ops within this company so that we become strategically better than other players in the space. So we can develop software faster with lower defect rates, with better capability. I think the more we can do that, that is where I think it's going to contribute mostly to the top line, as I see that. To me, over the next 4 or 5 years, I think it's going to be fundamental to how we, and probably other players in the space, develop products. A lot of it is going to turn on software. I think the best people in this space are the ones who are going to win."

I mean, look, on the space side, it's very exciting, a lot of stuff that's happening.

I mean, look, on the space side, it's very exciting, a lot of stuff that's happening. We talked the last quarter about $0.5 billion exquisite win that we have to a prime on a mission area that we've had some experience on. It's going to deliver over the next 5, 6 years. Our piece of that is more -- probably more front-end loaded. There's some capital associated with that program. When we've talked over the last year about our positioning on smallsats, we have multiple contract awards on that. That's going exceptionally well, there's some capital associated with that. And as it matures over the next 12 months or so, there's lots of other mission areas and components and capabilities that will be augmenting that smallsat mission that we're positioning ourselves on. It's all, I think, very exciting. Space Superiority is a huge growth driver for the company. I talked about our growth in that area being more than 15% this past year, and we see that continuing to grow. We think we're well positioned for opportunities [ falling ] ground control systems as well as space situational awareness. So lots of different ways we're competing on, on space superiority. And the last one is on the optics side. With Exelis, we acquired a great capability up in our Rochester facility for optics, and there is a recap of a lot of different capabilities in the space, some are RF-related and some are optics-related. And those recapitalizations sometimes require some additional capital investment. So that all goes together in some of the things we're spending our growth capital on in '19. As Rahul mentioned, we're up to about $170 million in '19. We'll see that mitigate itself a little bit going into fiscal '20, probably down around $15 million or $20 million, as we get through a lot of this sort of onetime growth capital we see in '19."

So 2% to 3% savings net of what's given back to the government, net of inflation, dropping to the bottom line. And we've been running towards the high end of that 2.5% to 3% range really over the last 5 or 6 years, and I expect that to continue and maybe even go above that over the next several years. What's driving it is changing over time, of course, supply chain is important and there's some engineering productivities, labor productivity in our factory. But even through Exelis integration, we continue to see, on top of the savings from Exelis integration, opportunities to just get better every day at what we do, and that's going to be continuation. So that was from my experience at UTC and what I see other companies doing. So I think that is generally pretty good. In terms of benchmarking on ERP systems, it's hard to say, but I can tell you 20 systems today is too many and 3 is about the right number. We've got a government business, we've got a commercial business and one -- it's fairly unique, which is why we're at 3. But really, what we're doing is we're bringing people into the company in senior roles either in IT or technology or other places that have experience outside of Harris that really look at what we do and bring best practices from their experiences here, and that is what's giving us some shining the light on some new opportunities that really are in front of us. And as I said, as I look into the future, I see as much opportunity ahead of us as I've seen we captured in the recent past. So I think the ground is pretty fertile on continuing to get better, drive efficiency and productivity really across our business in the next couple of years."

So there's some acceleration there. We see CS and Communications to continue to be at a high single-digit range. Frankly, I think, as I look back on '18 and when we started our guidance on '18 -- keep in mind we started at -- I believe it was 15% or mid-teens on DoD Tactical, and then we went up to 20 or low 20s and we ended at 35%. So I'm not so sure I'm really sort of calling it accurately. I think we're being more conservative than aggressive in our assumptions. And hopefully, we're in the same place today in '19, and hopefully, beyond there as well. As we see opportunities placed -- put on order a lot faster than we saw over last couple of years, and this is a pretty remarkable phenomenon, orders are being placed, dollars are being obligated at a much faster rate, not just in DoD, but also in the intelligence community, certainly from where we were a year or 2 ago. And that's been a very positive surprise. And like I said, the NDAA getting approved out of the House and maybe even getting approved by the President before we even hit September is pretty unique. And I think what's happening with things like that happening, it gives encouragement to people who issue procurement decisions to obligate dollars faster. Their confidence goes up. So I continue to see opportunities in '19 and beyond. So what's medium term? Medium term to us is 3 to 4 years, as I look at it and we look at our positioning, the amount of unused dollars that aren't yet committed where the budgets are growing. And what we see in the budgets that we can actually see over the next 5 years, there's a lot of opportunity to continue really robust growth across Harris going out in that 3-, 4-, 5-year period, Rob."
