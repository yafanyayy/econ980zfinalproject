I'm here in Brazil with our CFO, Karim; and Kimberly, head of IR. And the objective is obviously to provide you with an overview of the full year 2017 result, but also share with you the outlook for 2018.
Q4, as you've seen, was strong, and it concluded a year 2017, which was, indeed, at least, in my view, a very good year for Solvay. We delivered fully on our strategic priorities, and I think we are very much on track with our mid term objectives that we've shared with you in 2016.
Regarding portfolio, we've reached what I think was a very important milestone with the divestiture of Polyamide to PVDF. This was really the last, but very important part of our -- or the current chapter of portfolio upgrade that have started back in 2012. We expect the Polyamide transaction to close in the second part of 2018, and things now are going exactly as planned.
Regarding the operational performance. 
We have achieved in 2017 a 7.5% increase in EBITDA, with all our operating segments contributing to the growth. If we are thinking on an organic basis, which means excluding foreign exchange and scope impact, we grew at almost 10% our EBITDA, which I think is a good achievement, and once again, very much in line with our strategic objectives. 
We have a strong EBITDA margin, 22%, despite rising [indiscernible] and energy prices. We had a specific impact in soda ash, but overall, a very good ability to sustain margins, which are best-in-class in the European industry playing field.
Cash generation continued to be a priority for us. We have generated EUR 871 million of free cash flows. And you've seen also our earning per share moving up very significantly. 
If I look at the full year guidance that we've shared back in 2016, you see that we are very much in line to achieve or exceed, and in most cases, exceeds our objectives. 
If I look at cash flow, we expect to deliver on our target of EUR 2.4 billion despite the divestments that we've -- that took place during the period. And I don't want to forget the sustainability aspect of our objectives. Indeed, I am very pleased to see that today, what we call sustainable solution represents half of Solvay sales, 49% to be specific. This is good for the planet, but we are convinced that this is good for our growth and our bottom line.
With that, I will turn to Karim and ask him to provide you insights on our past performance. And I will get back to you with some comments on what we expect for 2018."

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything we'll talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, we stated for the divestments of the Polyami",997,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon and good morning. 
As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything we'll talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, we stated for the divestments of the Polyamide business which is now is in discontinued activities. 
I will start with the sales. 
And if you turn to Slide 11, you will note that net sales have increased by 6% in 2017 versus 2016. It is worth noting that volumes really drove this. They were up 8%, driven by growth across all our operating segments. 
Advanced Materials, up 5%. We see that in automotive, where we continued to benefit from the secular trend, the growth in the replacements of metal and high-performance polymers, and also growth in smart devices. 
Composite sales, aerospace ended the year slightly up, as the production ramp up of the F35 program, the Leap engine compensated for the continuing and expected declines in the wide-body platforms.
Industrial composite sales did decrease sharply in the year, as we experienced demand softness across all industrial markets, be it wind, high-performance auto and rail, to name but a few. And this unfortunately weighed on the overall composites growth.
Advanced Formulations volumes up 13%, and 2017 marked a recovery year for the oil and gas market. Technology Solutions ended the year slightly up as well, with higher sales of phosphate products sold to the electronics industries. We also noticed an improvement in mining towards the year-end, with increased cooper, aluminum prices driving higher demand for our mining agents for customers.
Performance Chemicals, volumes up 8% on good growth, soda ash and markets and specialty bicarbonate applications. And of course, we continued to benefit from the new HPPO peroxide in soda in Saudi Arabia that started up earlier in 2017.
So good from the top line to EBITDA, you can see the outcome and the bridge on Slide 12. 
The fact is we delivered 7.5% growth in EBITDA. Although as Jean-Pierre just mentioned, this is after overcoming headwinds in ForEx and accounting for the scope effects. Without which, EBITDA would have grown nearly 10%. 
As I've already indicated, the growth was driven by volume increases across our 3 business segments. Clearly, there is more. If you look at the fixed costs line, excellence programs and synergies have continued to play that part fully to essentially offset the inflationary effects. However, it is important to note that the overall increase in fixed costs also reflects [indiscernible] factors, clearly, the significant impact of the capacity additions in, China, U.S. and Italy, that have contributed to the top line. Clearly, we need more resources to support the volume growth. But at [ this year ] we saw the effect of costs from the divestments, as well as an increase in the variable remuneration as we share the successes and the progress improving have contributed to this outcome.
Overall, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, we are really pleased we've got -- we have sustained our industry-leading EBITDA margins of 22% for the year, despite what you saw towards the end of the year, which is the headwinds into the raw material and energy costs that have eroded some of the progress. It's very, very strong as we see it. But it really not important, it's really important to us to look at the cash and cash conversion. 
And if you turn to Slide 15, the cash flow, we believe, is still very positive. EUR 871 million compared to last year, doesn't tell you the full story because last year, we have the beneficial impact of businesses, such as Acetow and Vinythai, that were within our perimeter, but I'm sure, on the comparable basis and like-for-like basis, just focusing on our continuing businesses, free cash flow was 19% up as it grew from EUR 658 million last year to EUR 782 million this year.
That comes for 3 factors, higher EBITDA, I have explained, a reduction, which was fully anticipated, and capital expenditures, as well as ongoing and relentless focus on discipline and working capital.
Now that strong cash flow, combined with the effects of the proceeds of divestments, funded the debt service costs, the growing dividend, and have to reduce the underlying net debt by EUR 1.2 billion, which is now down to EUR 5.3 billion. Now that represents a leverage of 2.2x. And indeed, we will reduce further on a pro forma basis once we complete the Polyamide deal to approximately 1.9x.
You also remember that during the year, our credit rating [ wasn't ] upgraded by both Moody's and S&P, and again, another independent appreciation of the improvement in our credit strength.
Now clearly, there is quite a bit more I could say beyond cash and debt, but I'd rather have the computation in response to your questions. But I will highlight 2 aspects. One is we have continued to focus on improving our profitability beyond just EBITDA. If we look at the reduction in our financing charges, note the significant reduction in our underlying tax rate. That's why we say we have increased our underlying continuing business EPS, earnings per share by 26%. Secondly, really importantly, when you look at value creation to the profits and cash, return is one indicator that we have always recognized, we are keen and really did see some improvements. And our CFO, all right, which you will recognize as one of the most demanding cash metric has improved by 10%. We are now back at the levels that we had before the Cytec acquisition 2 years ago. And indeed, if you recall, we'd indicated we'll get to this level within 3 to 5 years of the acquisition. So we are essentially one year ahead of expectations on this particular measure.
I'm sure you'll have tons of questions, we will take later. But before you do that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre to take us into the forward-looking aspects."
377837,550936482,1405223,"Solvay SA, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you very much. As you can say, we can look back for a second. Clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thank to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim",1049,"Thank you very much. As you can say, we can look back for a second. 
Clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thank to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim has commented. And indeed, this was our priority when we entered into 2017, and I think where we've delivered. 
For 2018, we remain focused on driving growth. On an organic basis, and it's important to be specific on the wording, which means that constant perimeter and exchange rate, we expect full year underlying EBITDA to go between 5% and 7%. If you look at the Page 14 of the financial report, you'll see a very detailed presentation relating to this outlook.
In Advance Material, we expect double-digit growth, driven by volume improvement, both in the specialty Polymer and composite part of the equation. We see a strong growth coming from automotive. I would say, classical automotive, commission engine, but also electric vehicles. We see opportunities in smart devices. We see opportunities in aerospace, where, indeed, the LEAP engine and F-35 program are now fully on a growth trajectory and in a situation where we expect also a significant increase in bidding rate from the single-line jet project.
On the -- to finish on composite, on the non-aero part of the business, we are also expecting to see significant progress as soon the high-end automotive programs are starting again.
High single-digit growth in Advanced Formulation, same driver as last year. We are both on the mining and oil and gas side of the equation. 
And then in Performance Chemical, I know that a lot of you had questions o what will be the situation of soda ash. We've been very clear that we that the situation was under control, and that we should not expect a catastrophe as Turkish volume are finding their ways into Europe. Indeed, we can come to you today telling you with a strong level of confidence that we expect the impact in our Performance Chemical segment at the EBITDA line to be less than EUR 50 million, which -- it's a meaningful impact, but again, far from being a catastrophic impact. And we expect the soda ash business to average for bottom of its performance within the current environment.
So this 5% to 7% organic growth will led us to a cash generation where we expect to maintain the momentum. We are also seeing opportunities in the lower part of the P&L, where a significant improvement which are still to come. On our financing costs, we expect to gain around EUR 100 million in this part of the game.
So this leaves us with a couple of comments. 
The first one about priority. The key priority for Solvay top management in 2018 besides delivering on our financial objectives is creating a more efficient operating structure. We've been working on this for the last 12 month. We are now about to launch a pretty comprehensive program. We want simple objective, making sure that everyone at Solvay is focused on customer and making sure that we simplify the processes which needs to be simplified, to have an organization which allow us to deliver with customers which are more and more demanding. When we sell in aerospace, when we sell in automotive, when we sell in smart devices, we have customers who are expecting Solvay to deliver the best solution, the best level of service. And it's why it's so important for us to make sure that the organization is indeed completely focused on customer. This is what we will achieve, and this will deliver both some efficiencies, some short-term operational improvement, but also, and this is the real objective, this should allow us to generate more solid long-term growth.
Maybe one last comment regarding Solvay, it's the dividend where the discussion yesterday at the board, and the Board of Directors recommend a dividend increase of 4.3% to EUR 3.6 per share. This reflects both the strong delivery in 2017, but also the confidence in our ability to continue to create sustainable value for our shareholder.
Maybe a personal word before we move into the Q&A. I just want to make sure that you will understand where I stand. In fact, I was -- in past months, I was preparing for a next stage in my career. I didn't know when it would happen, where I would take nonexecutive positions, because I think it's another and very interesting way to contribute to the development of various companies. You might have seen, by the way, that this morning, I was proposed to become a member of the board of Airbus, which is, indeed, a very interesting opportunity. But earlier this month came on unexpected offer from the NG Board of Director which offered me to become their Chairman. I have accepted this with a clear condition that I wanted to be available at Solvay to do 2 things: one, deliver on the 2018 priorities; and second, make sure that the board can run without any time pressure the high-quality process to identify my successor and make sure that there would be indeed time for a smooth transition. So the board has decided -- the board of Solvay has decided to accelerate the identification of my successor. And our common objective of board and myself is to conclude this transition by the end of 2018. And I think that this should be seen as a very smooth transition by all of our stakeholders internally and externally. And in the meantime, I know it was it started , but I think it's a good coincidence. I have just made the decision to strengthen our connects. We have 3 new people going into the connect, while is leaving us to go back to a position in the U.S. I think that Augusto, who used to run our Specialty Polymer business, , who used to run our special business, and who is head of HR, we have indeed a very strong connects, able to deliver on 2018 parties, but also to prepare the next types of transformation for Solvay.
With that, I'm ready to take your question with obviously the support of Karim. Okay. First question? Hello?"

I was wondering if you could maybe just following on from your comments there, if you could just highlight what you think the core competency should be of the new incoming CEO of Solvay and share your thoughts in terms of what they need to achieve going forwards in the years to come. I'd be interested to hear on that. With regards to the results, could you -- you obviously talked about this focus on getting close to the customer. Obviously, following the divestments, your business is now less cyclical. What do you think is that -- how much do you think your under selling the technology that you currently got? i.e. what do you think the EBITDA margin of the business should be if you were operating at a very maximum? And lastly, pricing in the fourth quarter wasn't a big contributor in your bridge. And yet, I would have thought that cost inflation was probably quite prevalent given what we're seeing in some of the input costs. Is the costs -- are there price increases yet to come through? Where are we on the price versus costs dynamic starting in 2018 and looking beyond?"

Am I out of a discussion we had, including yesterday, with the board, there is a clear willingness to continue the strategy that we have started from and on which we have deliver. So clearly, we need something where there is strategic vision and is able to imagine what will be the next steps in Solvay transformation. On an operational point of view, the exercise that we will start this year to create a much lighter customer-focused organization is also something which needs to be developed. Bringing into the Carmax means that we think that Asia indeed is a strong potential growth platform for the group. We are probably one of the most diversified European-based chemical company in terms of geographical spread. I think we should be in a position to use even more this Asian platform. And at the end of the day, I think the objective of the board is just to find the best person possible to take the responsibility for Solvay executive teams. It could be an internal, it could be external. But clearly, the objective is to find the best person. And I think we have ample time to do this. 
Regarding our current situation, and where do I see -- how do I see our performance in the various clusters. Advanced Material cluster, we are almost at 30% EBITDA margin. The cluster is earning significantly more than the cost of capital. So the challenge there is growth, not much more of an server improvement in profitability. And growth will come from a pretty full pipe of opportunities. Short-term in specialty Polymer where we are indeed a number of business opportunities that we've seen in very different end market. When it come to composite, to short-term opportunities are linked to the fact that some of the key programs where we have taken a position are indeed taking off. This is the case of F35 leap engine. We've seen it already in '17, but it will be even more of use in '18. Increase in building rate for our single line, the arrival of the 777X. And longer term, we see very significant opportunities there. Advanced Formulation, I think there's a bit of a space for improvement in margins. What we've seen in oil and gas, what we are currently seeing in mining gives us the feeling that, indeed, the profitability could be improved to put this business also firmly in the value creation zone, which leads to a lower EBITDA margins than performance, because we are then in Advanced Materials, because we have less capital to remunerate in Advanced formulation. And then growth again is the priority. 
On pricing, I think we had a specific situation in soda ash. In fact, the impact of coming from Turkey is not so much of an impact. It was more a pressure on prices, which makes it difficult for us to fully compensate for the increase in energy costs, mostly coal. Overall, in other businesses, I see a pretty sound situation. And as you've mentioned, in activities where we are, we don't go back to the customer to ask them to increase prices because energy costs are already increased, because energy cost is a very small part of our cost. And yes, I see some opportunities looking forward in terms of pricing. But I remind you that with 22% margin, we are probably best-in-class in the European space as far as margin is concerned. So we probably have a bit less movement than some of our competitors when it comes to demonstrating our pricing power."

The consolidation that you're referring to are opportunities for us, always specific situations. But Bombardier, we have a significant position on this commercial jet.

So my reading is that the Airbus Bombardier will increase quite significantly the probability that this project will be a commercial success. So far, that's very good. On the Safran, on the Safran Zodiac, frankly speaking, we have a very good relationship with Safran for the leap engine. The relationship with Zodiac was pretty complex. They are not a large user, but they are using some of our materials. Zodiac was a pretty unconsolidated organizations with a lot of teams working quite independently. My understanding is that Safran will align this in a more systematic way, and I think we are well positioned to benefit from this. So overall, I think that this consolidation should play in our favor. On top of that, it's clear that the key issue that the large commercial aircraft producer as we are seeing is the organization of their supply chain. That's something which, in my view, will be improved with the consolidation. And as production rate will increase, we'll see opportunities arising for us. So all of this is good news. Advance Formulation, frankly speaking, we don't see any meaningful pre-buying situation. Yes, volume growth was significant. We see again good development in oil and gas. You've seen some news coming from there. We show also the development in mining. Metal prices are back at the level which allows for some projects to move on, so quite a sound situation that we expect to achieve. On your last question, I think it's probably pretty close today. I would need to make the exact calculation, but I think the automotive and aerospace probably represents around EUR 1 billion each. But again, take that as something directional, and we can clarify it. But it's what I have in mind after the divestiture of Polyamide which will leave the EP business out of our scope. So a reasonable assessment after Polyamide divestiture is probably 50-50."

And then the second question. On the industrial composites, you say it's still shrinking in Q4. You're expecting stability. Just a feel for how much you shrunk since 2015. I would guess somewhere over 30%. But how much lower could it go before it turns? And when do you expect returns? Second half or perhaps second quarter?"

And when you think automotive, again, it's the Ferraris, Lamborghinis. So these guys produce a few hundred on a given model, and they move to the next one. Sometime, with a bit of a lag time in between. So our view today is that we reached the bottom and that we should see some increase as we move into 2018. And this is what we start to see. It has dropped about 25% in 2015, so a little bit less than what you were implying. I remind you when we took over the business, it was still in the middle of an SAP or ERP crisis. That's something which has weighed obviously in customer loyalty. We have solved the situation, and we have recovered a much better relationship with our customers. 
On soda ash, to be absolutely clear, what I said is that due to your -- in a very strong volume situation, what we've enjoyed during the last part of '17 and in the beginning of '18, we've been able to weather reasonably well the arrival of the Turkish volumes, arrival of the fact that this volume will be made available during the course of 2018. The only impact, not meaningful, but the impact is that there were some implicit pressure on prices, which makes it difficult to fully compensate for the increase of the energy costs. And this is the reason why we are pointing to this negative impact on performance chemical, although we feel confident to say that this impact will be less than EUR 50 million. 2019, a bit only, but most of the impact of the new Turkish volumes are in '18. So I am reasonably confident that we've seen the worst, and that we should see a situation which develops reasonably favorably in the next few years."

We are starting to see guar coming back in the formulation, so that's good news. And it's part of the volume growth that we expect. In terms of pricing, there has been a pressure here and there. We are today seeing a situation, both in mining with Technology Solution and in oil and gas where we have space for price adjustment. That's good. We have also a situation regarding our purchasing conditions. And this impact especially the home and personal care cluster, which have improved significantly.

But we are today supplying all the battery makers, local Chinese player with our new Chinese plan, but also the international players, which are mostly Japanese and Korean guys. Good news, too, is that we see opportunities to get more out of our current unit in Peru, thanks to manufacturing excellence and the use of some digital tools. So overall, very good opportunities in front of us in batteries, but a bit early to quality what this could represent."

The fact that we can come with confidence, telling you that the impact will be less than EUR 50 million. It should show that, indeed, as we've been saying for the last quarters, we think that the situation is manageable and under a reasonable level of control.

I'm here in Brazil with our CFO, Karim; and Kimberly, Head of IR. And the objective is obviously to provide you with an overview of the full year 2017 result, but also share with you the outlook for 2018.
Q4, as you've seen, was strong, and it concluded a year 2017, which was, indeed, at least in my view, a very good year for Solvay. We delivered fully on our strategic priorities, and I think we are very much on track with our mid-term objectives that we've shared with you in 2016.
Regarding portfolio, we've reached what I think was a very important milestone with the divestiture of Polyamide to BASF. This was really the last but very important part of our -- of the current chapter of portfolio upgrade that have started back in 2012. We expect the Polyamide transaction to close in the second part of 2018, and things now are going exactly as planned.
Regarding the operational performance, we have achieved in 2017 a 7.5% increase in EBITDA, with all our operating segments contributing to the growth. If we are however thinking in -- on an organic basis, which means excluding foreign exchange and scope impact, we grew at almost 10% our EBITDA, which I think is a good achievement and once again, very much in line with our strategic objectives. 
We have a strong EBITDA margin, 22%, despite rising raw material and energy prices. We had a specific impact in soda ash, but overall, a very good ability to sustain margins, which are best-in-class in the European industry playing field.
Cash generation continued to be a priority for us. We have generated EUR 871 million of free cash flows. And you've seen also our earnings per share moving up very significantly. 
If I look at the full year guidance that we've shared back in 2016, you see that we are very much in line to achieve or exceed, and in most cases, exceeds our objectives. If I look at cash flow, we expect to deliver on our target of EUR 2.4 billion despite the divestment that we've -- that took place during the period. 
And I don't want to forget the sustainability aspect of our objectives. Indeed, I am very pleased to see that today, what we call sustainable solution represents half of Solvay sales, 49% to be specific. This is good for the planet, but we are also convinced that this is good for our growth and our bottom line.
With that, I will turn to Karim and ask him to provide additional insights on our past performance. And I will get back to you with some comments on what we expect for our 2018."
377837,550936482,1405680,"Solvay SA, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon, and good morning. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything I will talk about will be on an underlying basis.

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything I will talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, we stated for the divestments of the Polyamide business, which is now in discontinued activities. 
I will start with the sales. And if you turn to Slide 11, you will note that net sales have increased by 6% in 2017 versus 2016. It is worth noting that volumes really drove this. They were up 8%, driven by growth across all our operating segments. 
Advanced Materials, up 5%. We see that in automotive, where we continued to benefit from the secular trends, the growth in the replacements of metal and high-performance polymers and also growth in smart devices. Composite sales to aerospace ended the year slightly up, as the production ramp up of the F-35 program, the Leap engine compensated for the continuing and expected declines in the wide-bodied platforms. Industrial composite sales did decrease sharply in the year, as we experienced demand softness across all industrial markets, be it wind, high-performance auto and rail, to name but a few. And this unfortunately weighed on the overall composites growth.
Advanced Formulations volume's up 13%, as 2017 marked a recovery year for the oil and gas market. Technology Solutions ended the year slightly up as well, with higher sales of phosphate products sold to the electronics industries. We also noticed an improvement in mining towards the year-end, with increased copper, alumina prices driving higher demand for mining reagents with customers.
Performance Chemicals volume's up 8% on good growth in soda ash seaborne markets and specialty bicarbonate applications. And of course, we continued to benefit from the new HPPO peroxide plant in soda -- in Saudi Arabia that started up earlier in 2017.
So good. From the top line to the EBITDA, you can see the outcome and the bridge on Slide 12. The fact is we delivered 7.5% growth in EBITDA. Although as Jean-Pierre just mentioned, this is after overcoming headwinds in ForEx and accounting for the scope effects. Without which, EBITDA would have grown nearly 10%. As I've already indicated, the growth was driven by volume increases across our 3 business segments. 
Clearly, there's more. If you look at the fixed costs line, excellence programs and synergies have continued to play their part fully to essentially offset the inflationary effects. However, it is important to note that the overall increase in fixed costs also reflects 2 [ seller ] factors. Clearly, the significant impact of the capacity additions, the ones from Saudi, China, U.S. and Italy, that have contributed to the top line, clearly, we need more resources to support the volume growth. But additionally, we saw the effect of offering cost from the divestments as well as an increase in the variable remuneration, as we share the successes and the progress with Solvay improving have contributed to this outcome.
Overall, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, we are really pleased that we've got -- that we have sustained our industry-leading EBITDA margins of 22% for the year, despite what you saw towards the end of the year, which is the headwinds into the raw material and energy costs that have eroded some of the progress. It's very, very strong as we see it. But it really not important -- it's really important to us to look at the cash and the cash conversion. 
And if you turn to Slide 15, the cash flow, we believe, is still very positive. EUR 871 million compared to last year. It doesn't tell you the full story because last year, we had the beneficial impact of businesses, such as Acetow and Vinythai, that were within our perimeter, but we've sold. On the comparable basis and like-for-like basis, just focusing on our continuing businesses, free cash flow was 19% up, as it grew from EUR 658 million last year to EUR 782 million this year. That stems from 3 factors: higher EBITDA, that I've explained; a reduction, which was fully anticipated, in capital expenditures; as well as ongoing and relentless focus on discipline and working capital.
Now that strong cash flow, combined with the effects of the proceeds of divestments, funded the debt service cost, the growing dividend and have to reduce the underlying net debt by EUR 1.2 billion, which is now down to EUR 5.3 billion. Now that represents a leverage of 2.2x. And indeed, it will reduce further on a pro forma basis once we complete the Polyamide deal to approximately 1.9x.
You'd also remember that during the year, our credit rating wasn't upgraded by both Moody's and S&P, and again, another independent appreciation of the improvement in our credit strength.
Now clearly, there is quite a bit more I could say beyond cash and debt, but I'd rather have a conversation and respond to your questions. But I will highlight 2 aspects. One is we have continued to focus on improving our profitability beyond just EBITDA. If we look at the reduction in our financing charges, note the significant reduction in our underlying tax rate. That's why we say, we've increased our underlying continuing business EPS, earnings per share, by 26%. 
Secondly, and really importantly, when we look at value creation to the profits and cash, return is one indicator that we have always recognized. We are keen and really did some stream improvements. And our CFROI, which you will recognize as one of the most demanding cash metrics, has improved by 10%. We are now back at the levels that we had before the Cytec acquisition 2 years ago. And indeed, if you recall, we'd indicated we'll get to this level within 3 to 5 years of the acquisition. So we are essentially 1 year ahead of expectations on this particular measure.
I'm sure you have tons of questions we will take later. But before we do that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre to take us into the forward-looking aspects."

And if you can look [ backwards ] for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim",1071,"Thank you very much. And if you can look [ backwards ] for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim has commented. And indeed, this was our priority when we entered into 2017, and I think, as you are now aware, we've delivered. 
For 2018, we remain focused on driving growth. On an organic basis -- and it's important to be specific on the wording, which means that constant perimeter and exchange rate, we expect full year underlying EBITDA to go between 5% and 7%. If you look at the Page 14 of the financial report, you will see a very detailed presentation on -- relating to this outlook.
In Advance Material, we expect double-digit growth, driven by volume improvement, both in the specialty Polymer and composite part of the equation. We see a strong growth coming from automotive. I would say, classical automotive, commission engine, but also in electric vehicles. We see opportunities in smart devices. We see opportunities in aerospace, where, indeed, the LEAP engine and F-35 program are now firmly on a growth trajectory and in a situation where we expect also a significant increase in bidding rate from the single-line jet project. On the -- to finish on composite, on the non-aero part of the business, we are also expecting to see significant progress at some high-end automotive programs are starting again.
High single-digit growth in Advanced Formulation. Same driver as last year. They are both on the mining and oil and gas side of the equation. 
And then in Performance Chemical, I know that a lot of you had questions on what would be the situation of soda ash. We've been very clear that we are [ refuting ] that the situation was under control, and that we should not expect a catastrophe as Turkish volume are finding their ways into Europe. Indeed, we can come to you today telling you with a strong level of confidence that we expect the impact in our Performance Chemical segment at the EBITDA line to be less than EUR 50 million, which -- it's a meaningful impact, but again, far from being a catastrophic impact. And we expect the soda ash business to average for bottom of its performance within the current environment.
So this 5% to 7% organic growth will lead us to a cash generation where we expect to maintain the momentum. We are also seeing opportunities in the lower part of the P&L, where our significant improvement which are still to come. On our financing costs, we expect to gain around EUR 100 million in this part of the game.
So this leaves us with a couple of comments. The first one about priority. The key priority for Solvay top management in 2018 besides delivering on our financial objectives is creating a more efficient operating structure. We've been working on this for the last 12 months. We are now about to launch a pretty comprehensive program. We want simple objective, making sure that everyone at Solvay is focused on customer and making sure that we simplify the processes, which needs to be simplified, to have an organization which allow us to deliver with customers which are more and more demanding. 
When we sell in aerospace, when we sell in automotive, when we sell in smart devices, we have customers who are expecting Solvay to deliver the best solution, the best level of service. And it's why it's so important for us to make sure that the organization is indeed completely focused on customer. This is what we will achieve, and this will deliver both some efficiencies, some short-term operational improvement, but also -- and this is the whole objective, this is -- allow us to generate more solid long-term growth.
Maybe one last comment regarding Solvay, it's the dividend where the discussion yesterday at the board, and the Board of Directors recommend a dividend increase of 4.3% to EUR 3.6 per share. This reflects both the strong delivery in 2017 but also the confidence in our ability to continue to create sustainable value for our shareholder.
Maybe a personal word before we move into the Q&A. I just want to make sure that you will understand where I stand. In fact, I was -- in past months, I was preparing for a next stage in my career. I did not know when it would happen, where I would take nonexecutive positions, because I think it's another and very interesting way to contribute to the development of various companies. You might have seen, by the way, that this morning, I was proposed to become a member of the board of Airbus, which is, indeed, a very interesting opportunity. 
But earlier this month came an unexpected offer from the Engie Board of Director, which offered me to become their Chairman. I have accepted this with a clear condition that I wanted to be available at Solvay to do 2 things: one, deliver on the 2018 priorities; and second, make sure that the board can run without any time pressure the high-quality process to identify my successor and make sure that there would be indeed time for a smooth transition. So the board has decided -- the board of Solvay has decided to accelerate the identification of my successor. And our common objective, the board and myself, is to conclude this transition by the end of 2018. And I think that this should be seen as a very smooth transition by all of our stakeholders internally and externally. 
And in the meantime, although it was started imminently, but I think it's a good coincidence. I have just made the decision to strengthen our Comex. We have 3 new people going into the Comex, while Roger Kearns is leaving us to go back to a position in the U.S. I think that Augusto, who used to run our Specialty Polymer business; Hua Du, who used to run our special chem business; and Cécile Tandeau de Marsac, who is our Head of HR, we have indeed a very strong Comex, able to deliver on 2018 priorities but also to prepare the next steps of transformation for Solvay.
With that, I'm ready to take your question with obviously the support of Karim. Okay. First question? Hello?"

I'd be interested to hear on that. With regards to the results, could you -- you obviously talked about this focus on getting close to the customer. Obviously, following the divestments, your business is now less cyclical. What do you think is that -- how much do you think your underselling the technology that you've currently got? What do you think the EBITDA margin of the businesses -- of the business should be if you were operating at a very maximum? And lastly, pricing in the fourth quarter was -- wasn't a big contributor in your bridge. And yet, I would have thought the cost inflation was probably quite prevalent, given what we're seeing in some of the input costs. Is there costs -- are the price increases yet to come through? Where are we on the price versus costs dynamic starting 2018 and looking beyond?"

Well, on the first point, I will be prudent because this is for the board to have -- to set the profile of which would be my successor. On my -- out of a discussion we had, including yesterday, with the board, there is a clear willingness to continue the strategy that we have started and on which we have delivered. So clearly, we need something where the strategic vision and is able to imagine what will be the next steps in Solvay transformation. On an operational point of view, the exercise that we will start this year to create a much lighter customer-focused organization is also something which needs to be developed. Bringing Hua into the Comex means that we think that Asia indeed is a strong potential growth platform for the group. We are probably one of the most diversified European-based chemical company in terms of geographical spread. I think we should be in a position to use even more of this Asian platform. And at the end of the day, I think the objective of the board is just to find the best person possible to take the responsibility for Solvay executive teams. It could be an internal, it could be external. But clearly, the objective is to find the best person. And I think we have ample time to do this. Regarding our current situation, and where do I see -- how do I see our performance in the various clusters. Advanced Material cluster, we are almost at 30% EBITDA margin. The cluster is earning significantly more than the cost of capital. So the challenge there is growth, not much more than a server improvement in profitability. And growth will come from a pretty full pipe of opportunities. Short-term in specialty Polymer where we are indeed a number of business opportunities that we've seen in very different end market. When it come to composite, the short-term opportunities are linked to the fact that some of the key programs where we have taken a position are indeed taking off. This is the case of F-35 LEAP engine. We've seen it already in '17, but it will be even more of use in '18. Increase in building rate for our single line, the arrival of the 777X. And longer term, we see very significant opportunities there. Advanced Formulation, I think there's a bit of a space for improvement in margins. What we've seen in oil and gas, what we are currently seeing in mining gives us the feeling that, indeed, the profitability could be improved to put this business also firmly in the value creation zone, which is a -- which leads to a lower EBITDA margins than performance, because we have then Advanced Materials, because we have less capital to remunerate in Advanced Formulation. And then growth again is the priority. On pricing, I think we had a specific situation in soda ash. In fact, the impact of what's coming from Turkey is not so much of volume impact. It was not -- it was more a pressure on prices, which makes it difficult for us to fully compensate for the increase in energy cost, mostly coal. Overall, in other businesses, I see a pretty sound situation. As you've rightly mentioned, in the [indiscernible] activities where we are, we don't come back to the customer to ask them to increase prices because energy costs are being increased. Because energy cost is a very small part of our cost. And yes, I see some opportunities looking forward in terms of pricing. But I remind you that with 22% margin, we are probably best-in-class in the European space as far as margin is concerned. So we probably have a bit less [ movement ] than some of our competitors when it comes to demonstrating our pricing power."

There is a lot of consolidation taking place in the aerospace market: the Safran-Zodiac, Boeing-Embraer, Airbus-Bombardier. Do you see the consolidation in your end market as a challenge for you because customers might have more purchasing power or as an opportunity as you may leverage your business? The second question is on Advanced Formulations. The volume and mixed effects in Q4 were plus 10%, and that sounds quite high to me. And of course, this is triggered by Novecare, which established growth in Q4. Was there any pre-buying in advance of any price hikes you have -- you may have announced for the beginning of 2018? And the third question is on your end markets. With the disposal of the nylon business, your exposure to the end market automotive and aerospace obviously shrinks from roundabout 28% to roundabout 22%. I would like to know the split of both end markets, i.e. is automotive now half of this roughly 22% sales exposure."

The consolidation that you are referring to are opportunities for us, always specific situations. But Bombardier, we have a significant position on this commercial jet. When I say significant position, we are the supplier of composite. And it's a plane which contains a lot of composite. So my reading is that the Airbus-Bombardier deal will increase quite significantly the probability that this project will be a commercial success. So for us, that's very good. On the Safran -- on the Safran-Zodiac, frankly speaking, we have a very good relationship with Safran for the LEAP engine. The relationship with Zodiac was pretty complex. They are not a large user, but they are using some of our materials. Zodiac was a pretty unconsolidated organizations with a lot of teams working quite independently. My understanding is that Safran will align this in a more systematic way, and I think we are well positioned to benefit from this. So I -- overall, I think that this consolidation should play in our favor. On top of that, it's clear that the key issue that the large commercial aircraft producer as we are seeing is the organization of their supply chain. That's something which, in my view, will be improved with the consolidation. And as production rate will increase, we'll see opportunities arising for us. So all of this is good news. Advance Formulation, frankly speaking, we don't see any meaningful pre-buying situation. Yes, volume growth was significant. We see again good development in oil and gas. You've seen some news coming from there. We show also good development in mining. Metal prices are back at the level, which allows for some projects to move on, so quite a sound situation that we expect to achieve. On your last question, I think it's probably pretty close today. I would need to make the exact calculation, but I think the automotive and aerospace probably represent around EUR 1 billion each. But again, take that as something directional, and we can clarify it. But it's what I have in mind. After the divestiture of Polyamide, which will leave the EP business out of our scope. So a reasonable assessment after the Polyamide divestiture is probably 50-50."

So these guys produce a few hundred on a given model, and they move to the next one. Sometime, with a bit of a lag time in between. So our view today is that we reached the bottom and that we should see some increase as we move into 2018. And this is what we start to see. It has dropped about 25% since 2015, so a little bit less than what you were implying. I remind you that when we took over the business, it was still in the middle of an SAP or ERP crisis. That's something which has weighed obviously in customer loyalty. We have solved the situation, and we have recovered a much better relationship with our customers. On soda ash, to be absolutely clear, what I said is that due to your -- in a very strong volume situation, what we've enjoyed during the last part of '17 and in the beginning of '18, we've been able to weather reasonably well the arrival of the Turkish volumes, see the [ coal ] arrival of the fact that this volume will be made available during the course of 2018. The only impact, not meaningful, but the only impact is that there were some implicit pressure on prices, which makes it difficult to fully compensate for the increase of the energy costs. And this is the reason why we are pointing to this negative impact on performance chemical, although we feel very confident to say that this impact will be less than EUR 50 million. 2019, a bit only, but most of the impact of the new Turkish volumes are in '18. So I am reasonably confident that we've seen the worst, and that we should see a situation which develops reasonably favorably in the next few years."

What I would say, the benchmark can be simplified as approximately 2% to sales, on top of which, one we'd typically invest in that we would -- we as an investment for the future of resuming corporate R&I investments. This is a EUR 40 million to EUR 50 million a year.

There, we've seen a movement in the direction I just mentioned, which impacted us negatively in '16, '17. We are starting to see guar coming back in the formulation, so that's good news. And it's part of the volume growth that we expect. In terms of pricing, there has been a pressure here and there. We are today seeing a situation, both in mining with Technology Solution and in oil and gas with Novecare, where we have space for price adjustment. That's good.

Our free cash flow will exceed financing costs and dividend. One thing to highlight though is we have been working hard, not just in reducing the tax rate, but also the financing charges, and we also indicated that the cash financing charges in '18 will be lower than 2017 as well.

And when I say tremendously, I mean we could see sales doubling from one year to the next that -- increasing by 50%, sorry, which is not doubling, increasing by 50%. And at Solvay, from one year to the next, this being said, and I don't want to quantify it more specifically, it's still a small business within Solvay, more meaningful in Specialty Polymer. And yes, we have high expectation. But it's probably too early to give you the ability to measure all this our [indiscernible]. But we are today supplying all the battery makers, both the local Chinese player with our new Chinese plan, but also the international players, which are mostly Japanese and Korean guys.

For 2018, growth will continue to be on the agenda. Growth will accelerate in our core clusters. Unfortunately, we have 2 elements that we need to take into account. One is the foreign exchange that we have discussed. The other one is the situation in soda ash. But there, too, I think we are coming with reassuring news.

I'm here in Brazil with our CFO, Karim; and Kimberly, Head of IR. And the objective is obviously to provide you with an overview of the full year 2017 result, but also share with you the outlook for 2018.
Q4, as you've seen, was strong, and it concluded a year 2017, which was, indeed, at least in my view, a very good year for Solvay. We delivered fully on our strategic priorities, and I think we are very much on track with our mid-term objectives that we've shared with you in 2016.
Regarding portfolio, we've reached what I think was a very important milestone with the divestiture of Polyamide to BASF. This was really the last but very important part of our -- of the current chapter of portfolio upgrade that have started back in 2012. We expect the Polyamide transaction to close in the second part of 2018, and things now are going exactly as planned.
Regarding the operational performance, we have achieved in 2017 a 7.5% increase in EBITDA, with all our operating segments contributing to the growth. If we are however thinking in -- on an organic basis, which means excluding foreign exchange and scope impact, we grew at almost 10% our EBITDA, which I think is a good achievement and once again, very much in line with our strategic objectives. 
We have a strong EBITDA margin, 22%, despite rising raw material and energy prices. We had a specific impact in soda ash, but overall, a very good ability to sustain margins, which are best-in-class in the European industry playing field.
Cash generation continued to be a priority for us. We have generated EUR 871 million of free cash flows. And you've seen also our earnings per share moving up very significantly. 
If I look at the full year guidance that we've shared back in 2016, you see that we are very much in line to achieve or exceed, and in most cases, exceeds our objectives. If I look at cash flow, we expect to deliver on our target of EUR 2.4 billion despite the divestment that we've -- that took place during the period. 
And I don't want to forget the sustainability aspect of our objectives. Indeed, I am very pleased to see that today, what we call sustainable solution represents half of Solvay sales, 49% to be specific. This is good for the planet, but we are also convinced that this is good for our growth and our bottom line.
With that, I will turn to Karim and ask him to provide additional insights on our past performance. And I will get back to you with some comments on what we expect for our 2018."
377837,550936482,1405783,"Solvay SA, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon, and good morning. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything I will talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, restated for the divestments of the Polyamid",1005,"Jean-Pierre, thank you. Good afternoon, and good morning. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything I will talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, restated for the divestments of the Polyamide business, which is now in discontinued activities. 
I will start with the sales. And if you turn to Slide 11, you will note that net sales have increased by 6% in 2017 versus 2016. It is worth noting that volumes really drove this. They were up 8%, driven by growth across all our operating segments. 
Advanced Materials, up 5%. We see that in automotive, where we continued to benefit from the secular trends, the growth in the replacements of metal and high-performance polymers and also growth in smart devices. Composite sales to aerospace ended the year slightly up, as the production ramp up of the F-35 program, the Leap engine compensated for the continuing and expected declines in the wide-bodied platforms. Industrial composite sales did decrease sharply in the year, as we experienced demand softness across all industrial markets, be it wind, high-performance auto and rail, to name but a few. And this unfortunately weighed on the overall composites growth.
Advanced Formulations volume's up 13%, as 2017 marked a recovery year for the oil and gas market. Technology Solutions ended the year slightly up as well, with higher sales of phosphate products sold to the electronics industries. We also noticed an improvement in mining towards the year-end, with increased copper, alumina prices driving higher demand for mining reagents with customers.
Performance Chemicals volume's up 8% on good growth in soda ash seaborne markets and specialty bicarbonate applications. And of course, we continued to benefit from the new HPPO peroxide plant in soda -- in Saudi Arabia that started up earlier in 2017.
So good. From the top line to the EBITDA, you can see the outcome and the bridge on Slide 12. The fact is we delivered 7.5% growth in EBITDA. Although as Jean-Pierre just mentioned, this is after overcoming headwinds in ForEx and accounting for the scope effects. Without which, EBITDA would have grown nearly 10%. As I've already indicated, the growth was driven by volume increases across our 3 business segments. 
Clearly, there's more. If you look at the fixed costs line, excellence programs and synergies have continued to play their part fully to essentially offset the inflationary effects. However, it is important to note that the overall increase in fixed costs also reflects 2 or 3 other factors. Clearly, the significant impact of the capacity additions, the ones from Saudi, China, U.S. and Italy, that have contributed to the top line, clearly, we need more resources to support the volume growth. But additionally, we saw the effect of offering cost from the divestments as well as an increase in the variable remuneration, as we share the successes and the progress with Solvay improving have contributed to this outcome.
Overall, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, we are really pleased that we've got -- that we have sustained our industry-leading EBITDA margins of 22% for the year, despite what you saw towards the end of the year, which is the headwinds into the raw material and energy costs that have eroded some of the progress. It's very, very strong as we see it. But it really not important -- it's really important to us to look at the cash and the cash conversion. 
And if you turn to Slide 15, the cash flow, we believe, is still very positive. EUR 871 million compared to last year. It doesn't tell you the full story because last year, we had the beneficial impact of businesses, such as Acetow and Vinythai, that were within our perimeter, but we've sold. On the comparable basis and like-for-like basis, just focusing on our continuing businesses, free cash flow was 19% up, as it grew from EUR 658 million last year to EUR 782 million this year. That stems from 3 factors: higher EBITDA, that I've explained; a reduction, which was fully anticipated, in capital expenditures; as well as ongoing and relentless focus on discipline and working capital.
Now that strong cash flow, combined with the effects of the proceeds of divestments, funded the debt service cost, the growing dividend and helped to reduce the underlying net debt by EUR 1.2 billion, which is now down to EUR 5.3 billion. Now that represents a leverage of 2.2x. And indeed, it will reduce further on a pro forma basis once we complete the Polyamide deal to approximately 1.9x.
You'd also remember that during the year, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody's and S&P, and again, another independent appreciation of the improvement in our credit strength.
Now clearly, there is quite a bit more I could say beyond cash and debt, but I'd rather have a conversation and respond to your questions. But I will highlight 2 aspects. One is we have continued to focus on improving our profitability beyond just EBITDA. If we look at the reduction in our financing charges, note the significant reduction in our underlying tax rate. That's why we say, we've increased our underlying continuing business EPS, earnings per share, by 26%. 
Secondly, and really importantly, when we look at value creation to the profits and cash, return is one indicator that we have always recognized. We are keen and really did some stream improvements. And our CFROI, which you will recognize as one of the most demanding cash metrics, has improved by 10%. We are now back at the levels that we had before the Cytec acquisition 2 years ago. And indeed, if you recall, we'd indicated we'll get to this level within 3 to 5 years of the acquisition. So we are essentially 1 year ahead of expectations on this particular measure.
I'm sure you have tons of questions we will take later. But before we do that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre to take us into the forward-looking aspects."
377837,550936482,1405783,"Solvay SA, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2018",2018-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you very much. And if you can look backward just for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim",1070,"Thank you very much. And if you can look backward just for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim has commented. And indeed, this was our priority when we entered into 2017, and I think, as you are now aware, we've delivered. 
For 2018, we remain focused on driving growth. On an organic basis -- and it's important to be specific on the wording, which means that constant perimeter and exchange rate, we expect full year underlying EBITDA to go between 5% and 7%. If you look at the Page 14 of the financial report, you will see a very detailed presentation on -- relating to this outlook.
In Advance Material, we expect double-digit growth, driven by volume improvement, both in the specialty Polymer and composite part of the equation. We see a strong growth coming from automotive. I would say, classical automotive, commission engine, but also in electric vehicles. We see opportunities in smart devices. We see opportunities in aerospace, where, indeed, the LEAP engine and F-35 program are now firmly on a growth trajectory and in a situation where we expect also a significant increase in bidding rate from the single-line jet project. On the -- to finish on composite, on the non-aero part of the business, we are also expecting to see significant progress at some high-end automotive programs are starting again.
High single-digit growth in Advanced Formulation. Same driver as last year. They are both on the mining and oil and gas side of the equation. 
And then in Performance Chemical, I know that a lot of you had questions on what would be the situation of soda ash. We've been very clear that we are [ refuting ] that the situation was under control, and that we should not expect a catastrophe as Turkish volume are finding their ways into Europe. Indeed, we can come to you today telling you with a strong level of confidence that we expect the impact in our Performance Chemical segment at the EBITDA line to be less than EUR 50 million, which -- it's a meaningful impact, but again, far from being a catastrophic impact. And we expect the soda ash business to average for bottom of its performance within the current environment.
So this 5% to 7% organic growth will lead us to a cash generation where we expect to maintain the momentum. We are also seeing opportunities in the lower part of the P&L, where our significant improvement which are still to come. On our financing costs, we expect to gain around EUR 100 million in this part of the gain.
So this leaves us with a couple of comments. The first one about priority. The key priority for Solvay top management in 2018 besides delivering on our financial objectives is creating a more efficient operating structure. We've been working on this for the last 12 months. We are now about to launch a pretty comprehensive program. We want simple objective, making sure that everyone at Solvay is focused on customer and making sure that we simplify the processes, which needs to be simplified, to have an organization which allow us to deliver with customers which are more and more demanding. 
When we sell in aerospace, when we sell in automotive, when we sell in smart devices, we have customers who are expecting Solvay to deliver the best solution, the best level of service. And it's why it's so important for us to make sure that the organization is indeed completely focused on customer. This is what we will achieve, and this will deliver both some efficiencies, some short-term operational improvement, but also -- and this is the whole objective, this is -- allow us to generate more solid long-term growth.
Maybe one last comment regarding Solvay, it's the dividend where the discussion yesterday at the board, and the Board of Directors recommend a dividend increase of 4.3% to EUR 3.6 per share. This reflects both the strong delivery in 2017 but also the confidence in our ability to continue to create sustainable value for our shareholder.
Maybe a personal word before we move into the Q&A. I just want to make sure that you will understand where I stand. In fact, I was -- in past months, I was preparing for a next stage in my career. I did not know when it would happen, where I would take nonexecutive positions, because I think it's another and very interesting way to contribute to the development of various companies. You might have seen, by the way, that this morning, I was proposed to become a member of the board of Airbus, which is, indeed, a very interesting opportunity. 
But earlier this month came an unexpected offer from the Engie Board of Director, which offered me to become their Chairman. I have accepted this with a clear condition that I wanted to be available at Solvay to do 2 things: one, deliver on the 2018 priorities; and second, make sure that the board can run without any time pressure the high-quality process to identify my successor and make sure that there would be indeed time for a smooth transition. So the board has decided -- the board of Solvay has decided to accelerate the identification of my successor. And our common objective, the board and myself, is to conclude this transition by the end of 2018. And I think that this should be seen as a very smooth transition by all of our stakeholders internally and externally. 
And in the meantime, although it was started imminently, but I think it's a good coincidence. I have just made the decision to strengthen our Comex. We have 3 new people going into the Comex, while Roger Kearns is leaving us to go back to a position in the U.S. I think that Augusto, who used to run our Specialty Polymer business; Hua Du, who used to run our special chem business; and Cécile Tandeau de Marsac, who is our Head of HR, we have indeed a very strong Comex, able to deliver on 2018 priorities but also to prepare the next steps of transformation for Solvay.
With that, I'm ready to take your question with obviously the support of Karim. Okay. First question? Hello?"

And Jean-Pierre, congratulations on your new appointments. I was wondering if you could -- maybe just following on from your comments there, if you could just highlight what you think the core competency should be of the new incoming CEO of Solvay and share your thoughts in terms of what they need to achieve going forward in the years to come. I'd be interested to hear on that. With regards to the results, could you -- you obviously talked about this focus on getting close to the customer. Obviously, following the divestments, your business is now less cyclical. What do you think is that -- how much do you think your underselling the technology that you've currently got, i.e,  what do you think the EBITDA margin of the businesses -- of the business should be if you were operating at a very maximum? And lastly, pricing in the fourth quarter was -- wasn't a big contributor in your bridge. And yet, I would have thought that cost inflation was probably quite prevalent, given what we're seeing in some of the input costs. Is there costs -- are the price increases yet to come through? Where are we on the price versus costs dynamic starting 2018 and looking beyond?"

Well, on the first point, I will be prudent because this is for the board to have -- to set the profile of which would be my successor. On my -- out of a discussion we had, including yesterday, with the board, there is a clear willingness to continue the strategy that we have started and on which we have delivered. So clearly, we need something where the strategic vision and is able to imagine what will be the next steps in Solvay transformation. On an operational point of view, the exercise that we will start this year to create a much lighter customer-focused organization is also something which needs to be developed. Bringing Hua into the Comex means that we think that Asia indeed is a strong potential growth platform for the group. We are probably one of the most diversified European-based chemical company in terms of geographical spread. I think we should be in a position to use even more of this Asian platform. And at the end of the day, I think the objective of the board is just to find the best person possible to take the responsibility for Solvay executive teams. It could be an internal, it could be external. But clearly, the objective is to find the best person. And I think we have ample time to do this. Regarding our current situation, and where do I see -- how do I see our performance in the various clusters. Advanced Material cluster, we are almost at 30% EBITDA margin. The cluster is earning significantly more than the cost of capital. So the challenge there is growth, not much more than a server improvement in profitability. And growth will come from a pretty full pipe of opportunities. Short-term in specialty Polymer where we are indeed a number of business opportunities that we've seen in very different end market. When it come to composite, the short-term opportunities are linked to the fact that some of the key programs where we have taken a position are indeed taking off. This is the case of F-35 LEAP engine. We've seen it already in '17, but it will be even more of use in '18. Increase in building rate for our single line, the arrival of the 777X. And longer term, we see very significant opportunities there. Advanced Formulation, I think there's a bit of a space for improvement in margins. What we've seen in oil and gas, what we are currently seeing in mining gives us the feeling that, indeed, the profitability could be improved to put this business also firmly in the value creation zone, which is a -- which leads to a lower EBITDA margins than performance, because we have then Advanced Materials, because we have less capital to remunerate in Advanced Formulation. And then growth again is the priority. On pricing, I think we had a specific situation in soda ash. In fact, the impact of what's coming from Turkey is not so much of volume impact. It was not -- it was more a pressure on prices, which makes it difficult for us to fully compensate for the increase in energy cost, mostly coal. Overall, in other businesses, I see a pretty sound situation. As you've rightly mentioned, in the [indiscernible] activities where we are, we don't come back to the customer to ask them to increase prices because energy costs are being increased. Because energy cost is a very small part of our cost. And yes, I see some opportunities looking forward in terms of pricing. But I remind you that with 22% margin, we are probably best-in-class in the European space as far as margin is concerned. So we probably have a bit less [ movement ] than some of our competitors when it comes to demonstrating our pricing power."

There is a lot of consolidation taking place in the aerospace market: the Safran-Zodiac, Boeing-Embraer, Airbus-Bombardier. Do you see the consolidation in your end market as a challenge for you because customers might have more purchasing power or as an opportunity as you may leverage your business? The second question is on Advanced Formulations. The volume and mixed effects in Q4 were plus 10%, and that sounds quite high to me. And of course, this is triggered by Novecare, which established growth in Q4. Was there any pre-buying in advance of any price hikes you have -- you may have announced for the beginning of 2018? And the third question is on your end markets. With the disposal of the nylon business, your exposure to the end market automotive and aerospace obviously shrinks from roundabout 28% to roundabout 22%. I would like to know the split of both end markets, i.e. is automotive now half of this roughly 22% sales exposure."

The consolidation that you are referring to are opportunities for us, always specific situations. But Bombardier, we have a significant position on this commercial jet. When I say significant position, we are the supplier of composite. And it's a plane which contains a lot of composite. So my reading is that the Airbus-Bombardier deal will increase quite significantly the probability that this project will be a commercial success. So for us, that's very good. On the Safran -- on the Safran-Zodiac, frankly speaking, we have a very good relationship with Safran for the LEAP engine. The relationship with Zodiac was pretty complex. They are not a large user, but they are using some of our materials. Zodiac was a pretty unconsolidated organizations with a lot of teams working quite independently. My understanding is that Safran will align this in a more systematic way, and I think we are well positioned to benefit from this. So I -- overall, I think that this consolidation should play in our favor. On top of that, it's clear that the key issue that the large commercial aircraft producer as we are seeing is the organization of their supply chain. That's something which, in my view, will be improved with the consolidation. And as production rate will increase, we'll see opportunities arising for us. So all of this is good news. Advance Formulation, frankly speaking, we don't see any meaningful pre-buying situation. Yes, volume growth was significant. We see again good development in oil and gas. You've seen some news coming from there. We show also good development in mining. Metal prices are back at the level, which allows for some projects to move on, so quite a sound situation that we expect to achieve. On your last question, I think it's probably pretty close today. I would need to make the exact calculation, but I think the automotive and aerospace probably represent around EUR 1 billion each. But again, take that as something directional, and we can clarify it. But it's what I have in mind. After the divestiture of Polyamide, which will leave the EP business out of our scope. So a reasonable assessment after the Polyamide divestiture is probably 50-50."

Industrial Composite, once again, it's a type of -- rather small project. And when you think automotive, again, it's the Ferraris, Lamborghinis. So these guys produce a few hundred on a given model, and they move to the next one. Sometime, with a bit of a lag time in between. So our view today is that we reached the bottom and that we should see some increase as we move into 2018. And this is what we start to see. It has dropped about 25% since 2015, so a little bit less than what you were implying. I remind you that when we took over the business, it was still in the middle of an SAP or ERP crisis. That's something which has weighed obviously in customer loyalty. We have solved the situation, and we have recovered a much better relationship with our customers. On soda ash, to be absolutely clear, what I said is that due to your -- in a very strong volume situation, what we've enjoyed during the last part of '17 and in the beginning of '18, we've been able to weather reasonably well the arrival of the Turkish volumes, physical arrival of the fact that this volume will be made available during the course of 2018. The only impact, not meaningful, but the only impact is that there were some implicit pressure on prices, which makes it difficult to fully compensate for the increase of the energy costs. And this is the reason why we are pointing to this negative impact on performance chemical, although we feel very confident to say that this impact will be less than EUR 50 million. 2019, a bit only, but most of the impact of the new Turkish volumes are in '18. So I am reasonably confident that we've seen the worst, and that we should see a situation which develops reasonably favorably in the next few years."

But whatever we do, we do 2 things. We absolutely look for a very rapid payback. We typically talk of less than 2 years cash payback on sub-costs.

The focus, let's say, in preparing this future and realigning our functions to help serve our customers, it's got nothing to do with the cost motivator, at least around the sales growth. But it will have an efficiency impact that will show itself through in the next couple of years."

One is indeed mix. Overall mix in our analysis is within the volume. The mix was from in oil and gas from the expensive guar base formulation to the less-expensive friction reducer. There, we've seen a movement in the direction I just mentioned, which impacted us negatively in '16, '17. We are starting to see guar coming back in the formulation, so that's good news. And it's part of the volume growth that we expect. In terms of pricing, there has been a pressure here and there. We are today seeing a situation, both in mining with Technology Solution and in oil and gas with Novecare, where we have space for price adjustment. That's good. We have also a situation regarding our purchasing conditions. And this impact especially the home and personal care cluster, which have improved significantly. In the last part of 2017, we have negotiated and started new contracts for oleochemical in -- with significantly better conditions after the summer period in 2017, and this will have a full year impact next year. So these are the reasons why we expect some positive impact on margin for Advanced Formulation in 2018."

I think on the soda ash, there is a very modest price erosion in '18 relative to '17. But again, the team that we have in soda ash is really doing a lot to mitigate with really raising the bar on excellence. So there's a lot of mitigation to compensate. So I'd say, operationally, we're maintaining the volume, the leadership positions. Yes, there's modest price erosion, something we're not going to quantify. But net-net, what we can do in the current market conditions and the new capacity is also to overcome the increase in energy costs that we're already seeing. Essentially, had energy costs been more favorable and going back this way, I think you will see different expectation despite the significant capacity addition. And that's not by accident because we've been planning and anticipating, getting ready for this 2 years now. As far as free cash flow is concerned, I can give you a very simple answer, which is yes. Our free cash flow will exceed financing costs and dividend. One thing to highlight though is we have been working hard, not just in reducing the tax rate, but also the financing charges, and we also indicated that the cash financing charges in '18 will be lower than 2017 as well. What does that mean? It means that our cash available to equities, so free cash flow after all financing costs, will be quite a lot higher than we had in 2017. Does that help?"

And at Solvay, from one year to the next, this being said, and I don't want to quantify it more specifically, it's still a small business within Solvay, more meaningful in Specialty Polymer.

I'm here in Brazil with our CFO, Karim; and Kimberly, Head of IR. And the objective is obviously to provide you with an overview of the full year 2017 result, but also share with you the outlook for 2018.
Q4, as you've seen, was strong, and it concluded a year 2017, which was, indeed, at least in my view, a very good year for Solvay. We delivered fully on our strategic priorities, and I think we are very much on track with our mid-term objectives that we've shared with you in 2016.
Regarding portfolio, we've reached what I think was a very important milestone with the divestiture of Polyamide to BASF. This was really the last but very important part of our -- of the current chapter of portfolio upgrade that have started back in 2012. We expect the Polyamide transaction to close in the second part of 2018, and things now are going exactly as planned.
Regarding the operational performance, we have achieved in 2017 a 7.5% increase in EBITDA, with all our operating segments contributing to the growth. If we are however thinking in -- on an organic basis, which means excluding foreign exchange and scope impact, we grew at almost 10% our EBITDA, which I think is a good achievement and once again, very much in line with our strategic objectives. 
We have a strong EBITDA margin, 22%, despite rising raw material and energy prices. We had a specific impact in soda ash, but overall, a very good ability to sustain margins, which are best-in-class in the European industry playing field.
Cash generation continued to be a priority for us. We have generated EUR 871 million of free cash flows. And you've seen also our earnings per share moving up very significantly. 
If I look at the full year guidance that we've shared back in 2016, you see that we are very much in line to achieve or exceed, and in most cases, exceeds our objectives. If I look at cash flow, we expect to deliver on our target of EUR 2.4 billion despite the divestment that we've -- that took place during the period. 
And I don't want to forget the sustainability aspect of our objectives. Indeed, I am very pleased to see that today, what we call sustainable solution represents half of Solvay sales, 49% to be specific. This is good for the planet, but we are also convinced that this is good for our growth and our bottom line.
With that, I will turn to Karim and ask him to provide additional insights on our past performance. And I will get back to you with some comments on what we expect for our 2018."

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website, and everything I will talk about will be on an underlying basis. And clearly, restated for the divestments of the Polyamide business, which is now in discontinued activities. 
I will start with the sales. And if you turn to Slide 11, you will note that net sales have increased by 6% in 2017 versus 2016. It is worth noting that volumes really drove this. They were up 8%, driven by growth across all our operating segments. 
Advanced Materials, up 5%. We see that in automotive, where we continued to benefit from the secular trends, the growth in the replacements of metal and high-performance polymers and also growth in smart devices. Composite sales to aerospace ended the year slightly up, as the production ramp-up of the F-35 program, the Leap engine compensated for the continuing and expected declines in the wide-bodied platforms. Industrial composite sales did decrease sharply in the year, as we experienced demand softness across all industrial markets, be it wind, high-performance auto and rail, to name but a few. And this unfortunately weighed on the overall composites growth.
Advanced Formulations volume's up 13%, as 2017 marked a recovery year for the oil and gas market. Technology Solutions ended the year slightly up as well, with higher sales of phosphate products sold to the electronics industries. We also noticed an improvement in mining towards the year-end, with increased copper, alumina prices driving higher demand for mining reagents with customers.
Performance Chemicals volume's up 8% on good growth in soda ash seaborne markets and specialty bicarbonate applications. And of course, we continued to benefit from the new HPPO peroxide plant in soda -- in Saudi Arabia that started up earlier in 2017.
So good. From the top line to the EBITDA, you can see the outcome and the bridge on Slide 12. The fact is we delivered 7.5% growth in EBITDA. Although as Jean-Pierre just mentioned, this is after overcoming headwinds in ForEx and accounting for the scope effects. Without which, EBITDA would have grown nearly 10%. As I've already indicated, the growth was driven by volume increases across our 3 business segments. 
Clearly, there's more. If you look at the fixed costs line, excellence programs and synergies have continued to play their part fully to essentially offset the inflationary effects. However, it is important to note that the overall increase in fixed costs also reflects 2 or 3 other factors. Clearly, the significant impact of the capacity additions, the ones from Saudi, China, U.S. and Italy, that have contributed to the top line, clearly, we need more resources to support the volume growth. But additionally, we saw the effect of offering cost from the divestments as well as an increase in the variable remuneration, as we share the successes and the progress with Solvay improving have contributed to this outcome.
Overall, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, we are really pleased that we've got -- that we have sustained our industry-leading EBITDA margins of 22% for the year, despite what you saw towards the end of the year, which is the headwinds into the raw material and energy costs that have eroded some of the progress. It's very, very strong as we see it. But it really not important -- it's really important to us to look at the cash and the cash conversion. 
And if you turn to Slide 15, the cash flow, we believe, is still very positive. EUR 871 million compared to last year. It doesn't tell you the full story because last year, we had the beneficial impact of businesses, such as Acetow and Vinythai, that were within our perimeter, but we've sold. On the comparable basis and like-for-like basis, just focusing on our continuing businesses, free cash flow was 19% up, as it grew from EUR 658 million last year to EUR 782 million this year. That stems from 3 factors: higher EBITDA, that I've explained; a reduction, which was fully anticipated, in capital expenditures; as well as ongoing and relentless focus on discipline and working capital.
Now that strong cash flow, combined with the effects of the proceeds of divestments, funded the debt service cost, the growing dividend and helped to reduce the underlying net debt by EUR 1.2 billion, which is now down to EUR 5.3 billion. Now that represents a leverage of 2.2x. And indeed, it will reduce further on a pro forma basis once we complete the Polyamide deal to approximately 1.9x.
You'd also remember that during the year, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody's and S&P, and again, another independent appreciation of the improvement in our credit strength.
Now clearly, there is quite a bit more I could say beyond cash and debt, but I'd rather have a conversation and respond to your questions. But I will highlight 2 aspects. One is we have continued to focus on improving our profitability beyond just EBITDA. If we look at the reduction in our financing charges, note the significant reduction in our underlying tax rate. That's why we say, we've increased our underlying continuing business EPS, earnings per share, by 26%. 
Secondly, and really importantly, when we look at value creation to the profits and cash, return is one indicator that we have always recognized. We are keen and really did some stream improvements. And our CFROI, which you will recognize as one of the most demanding cash metrics, has improved by 10%. We are now back at the levels that we had before the Cytec acquisition 2 years ago. And indeed, if you recall, we'd indicated we'll get to this level within 3 to 5 years of the acquisition. So we are essentially 1 year ahead of expectations on this particular measure.
I'm sure you have tons of questions we will take later. But before we do that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre to take us into the forward-looking aspects."

And if you can look backward just for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim",1070,"Thank you very much. And if you can look backward just for a second, clearly, the big achievement in 2017 was volume growth. It's thanks to this very significant volume growth that we've been able to generate the improvement in EBITDA and cash that Karim has commented. And indeed, this was our priority when we entered into 2017, and I think, as you are now aware, we've delivered. 
For 2018, we remain focused on driving growth. On an organic basis -- and it's important to be specific on the wording, which means that constant perimeter and exchange rate, we expect full year underlying EBITDA to go between 5% and 7%. If you look at the Page 14 of the financial report, you will see a very detailed presentation on -- relating to this outlook.
In Advance Material, we expect double-digit growth, driven by volume improvement, both in the specialty Polymer and composite part of the equation. We see a strong growth coming from automotive. I would say, classical automotive, commission engine, but also in electric vehicles. We see opportunities in smart devices. We see opportunities in aerospace, where, indeed, the LEAP engine and F-35 program are now firmly on a growth trajectory and in a situation where we expect also a significant increase in bidding rate from the single-line jet project. On the -- to finish on composite, on the non-aero part of the business, we are also expecting to see significant progress at some high-end automotive programs are starting again.
High single-digit growth in Advanced Formulation. Same driver as last year. They are both on the mining and oil and gas side of the equation. 
And then in Performance Chemical, I know that a lot of you had questions on what would be the situation of soda ash. We've been very clear that we are [ refuting ] that the situation was under control, and that we should not expect a catastrophe as Turkish volume are finding their ways into Europe. Indeed, we can come to you today telling you with a strong level of confidence that we expect the impact in our Performance Chemical segment at the EBITDA line to be less than EUR 50 million, which -- it's a meaningful impact, but again, far from being a catastrophic impact. And we expect the soda ash business to average for bottom of its performance within the current environment.
So this 5% to 7% organic growth will lead us to a cash generation where we expect to maintain the momentum. We are also seeing opportunities in the lower part of the P&L, where our significant improvement which are still to come. On our financing costs, we expect to gain around EUR 100 million in this part of the gain.
So this leaves us with a couple of comments. The first one about priority. The key priority for Solvay top management in 2018 besides delivering on our financial objectives is creating a more efficient operating structure. We've been working on this for the last 12 months. We are now about to launch a pretty comprehensive program. We want simple objective, making sure that everyone at Solvay is focused on customer and making sure that we simplify the processes, which needs to be simplified, to have an organization which allow us to deliver with customers which are more and more demanding. 
When we sell in aerospace, when we sell in automotive, when we sell in smart devices, we have customers who are expecting Solvay to deliver the best solution, the best level of service. And it's why it's so important for us to make sure that the organization is indeed completely focused on customer. This is what we will achieve, and this will deliver both some efficiencies, some short-term operational improvement, but also -- and this is the whole objective, this is -- allow us to generate more solid long-term growth.
Maybe one last comment regarding Solvay, it's the dividend where the discussion yesterday at the board, and the Board of Directors recommend a dividend increase of 4.3% to EUR 3.6 per share. This reflects both the strong delivery in 2017 but also the confidence in our ability to continue to create sustainable value for our shareholder.
Maybe a personal word before we move into the Q&A. I just want to make sure that you will understand where I stand. In fact, I was -- in past months, I was preparing for a next stage in my career. I did not know when it would happen, where I would take nonexecutive positions, because I think it's another and very interesting way to contribute to the development of various companies. You might have seen, by the way, that this morning, I was proposed to become a member of the board of Airbus, which is, indeed, a very interesting opportunity. 
But earlier this month came an unexpected offer from the Engie Board of Director, which offered me to become their Chairman. I have accepted this with a clear condition that I wanted to be available at Solvay to do 2 things: one, deliver on the 2018 priorities; and second, make sure that the board can run without any time pressure the high-quality process to identify my successor and make sure that there would be indeed time for a smooth transition. So the board has decided -- the board of Solvay has decided to accelerate the identification of my successor. And our common objective, the board and myself, is to conclude this transition by the end of 2018. And I think that this should be seen as a very smooth transition by all of our stakeholders internally and externally. 
And in the meantime, although it was started imminently, but I think it's a good coincidence. I have just made the decision to strengthen our Comex. We have 3 new people going into the Comex, while Roger Kearns is leaving us to go back to a position in the U.S. I think that Augusto, who used to run our Specialty Polymer business; Hua Du, who used to run our special chem business; and Cécile Tandeau de Marsac, who is our Head of HR, we have indeed a very strong Comex, able to deliver on 2018 priorities but also to prepare the next steps of transformation for Solvay.
With that, I'm ready to take your question with obviously the support of Karim. Okay. First question? Hello?"

I was wondering if you could -- maybe just following on from your comments there, if you could just highlight what you think the core competency should be of the new incoming CEO of Solvay and share your thoughts in terms of what they need to achieve going forward in the years to come. I'd be interested to hear on that. With regards to the results, could you -- you obviously talked about this focus on getting close to the customer. Obviously, following the divestments, your business is now less cyclical. What do you think is that -- how much do you think your underselling the technology that you've currently got, i.e,  what do you think the EBITDA margin of the businesses -- of the business should be if you were operating at a very maximum? And lastly, pricing in the fourth quarter was -- wasn't a big contributor in your bridge. And yet, I would have thought that cost inflation was probably quite prevalent, given what we're seeing in some of the input costs. Is there costs -- are the price increases yet to come through? Where are we on the price versus costs dynamic starting 2018 and looking beyond?"

Well, on the first point, I will be prudent because this is for the board to have -- to set the profile of which would be my successor. On my -- out of a discussion we had, including yesterday, with the board, there is a clear willingness to continue the strategy that we have started and on which we have delivered. So clearly, we need something where the strategic vision and is able to imagine what will be the next steps in Solvay transformation. On an operational point of view, the exercise that we will start this year to create a much lighter customer-focused organization is also something which needs to be developed. Bringing Hua into the Comex means that we think that Asia indeed is a strong potential growth platform for the group. We are probably one of the most diversified European-based chemical company in terms of geographical spread. I think we should be in a position to use even more of this Asian platform. And at the end of the day, I think the objective of the board is just to find the best person possible to take the responsibility for Solvay executive teams. It could be an internal, it could be external. But clearly, the objective is to find the best person. And I think we have ample time to do this. Regarding our current situation, and where do I see -- how do I see our performance in the various clusters. Advanced Material cluster, we are almost at 30% EBITDA margin. The cluster is earning significantly more than the cost of capital. So the challenge there is growth, not much more than a server improvement in profitability. And growth will come from a pretty full pipe of opportunities. Short-term in specialty Polymer where we are indeed a number of business opportunities that we've seen in very different end market. When it come to composite, the short-term opportunities are linked to the fact that some of the key programs where we have taken a position are indeed taking off. This is the case of F-35 LEAP engine. We've seen it already in '17, but it will be even more of use in '18. Increase in building rate for our single line, the arrival of the 777X. And longer term, we see very significant opportunities there. Advanced Formulation, I think there's a bit of a space for improvement in margins. What we've seen in oil and gas, what we are currently seeing in mining gives us the feeling that, indeed, the profitability could be improved to put this business also firmly in the value creation zone, which is a -- which leads to a lower EBITDA margins than performance, because we have then Advanced Materials, because we have less capital to remunerate in Advanced Formulation. And then growth again is the priority. On pricing, I think we had a specific situation in soda ash. In fact, the impact of what's coming from Turkey is not so much of volume impact. It was not -- it was more a pressure on prices, which makes it difficult for us to fully compensate for the increase in energy cost, mostly coal. Overall, in other businesses, I see a pretty sound situation. As you've rightly mentioned, in the [indiscernible] activities where we are, we don't come back to the customer to ask them to increase prices because energy costs are being increased. Because energy cost is a very small part of our cost. And yes, I see some opportunities looking forward in terms of pricing. But I remind you that with 22% margin, we are probably best-in-class in the European space as far as margin is concerned. So we probably have a bit less [ movement ] than some of our competitors when it comes to demonstrating our pricing power."

And of course, this is triggered by Novecare, which established growth in Q4. Was there any pre-buying in advance of any price hikes you have -- you may have announced for the beginning of 2018? And the third question is on your end markets. With the disposal of the nylon business, your exposure to the end market automotive and aerospace obviously shrinks from roundabout 28% to roundabout 22%.

The consolidation that you are referring to are opportunities for us, always specific situations. But Bombardier, we have a significant position on this commercial jet. When I say significant position, we are the supplier of composite. And it's a plane which contains a lot of composite. So my reading is that the Airbus-Bombardier deal will increase quite significantly the probability that this project will be a commercial success. So for us, that's very good. On the Safran -- on the Safran-Zodiac, frankly speaking, we have a very good relationship with Safran for the LEAP engine. The relationship with Zodiac was pretty complex. They are not a large user, but they are using some of our materials. Zodiac was a pretty unconsolidated organizations with a lot of teams working quite independently. My understanding is that Safran will align this in a more systematic way, and I think we are well positioned to benefit from this. So I -- overall, I think that this consolidation should play in our favor. On top of that, it's clear that the key issue that the large commercial aircraft producer as we are seeing is the organization of their supply chain. That's something which, in my view, will be improved with the consolidation. And as production rate will increase, we'll see opportunities arising for us. So all of this is good news. Advance Formulation, frankly speaking, we don't see any meaningful pre-buying situation. Yes, volume growth was significant. We see again good development in oil and gas. You've seen some news coming from there. We show also good development in mining. Metal prices are back at the level, which allows for some projects to move on, so quite a sound situation that we expect to achieve. On your last question, I think it's probably pretty close today. I would need to make the exact calculation, but I think the automotive and aerospace probably represent around EUR 1 billion each. But again, take that as something directional, and we can clarify it. But it's what I have in mind. After the divestiture of Polyamide, which will leave the EP business out of our scope. So a reasonable assessment after the Polyamide divestiture is probably 50-50."

So our view today is that we reached the bottom and that we should see some increase as we move into 2018. And this is what we start to see. It has dropped about 25% since 2015, so a little bit less than what you were implying. I remind you that when we took over the business, it was still in the middle of an SAP or ERP crisis. That's something which has weighed obviously in customer loyalty. We have solved the situation, and we have recovered a much better relationship with our customers. On soda ash, to be absolutely clear, what I said is that due to your -- in a very strong volume situation, what we've enjoyed during the last part of '17 and in the beginning of '18, we've been able to weather reasonably well the arrival of the Turkish volumes, physical arrival of the fact that this volume will be made available during the course of 2018. The only impact, not meaningful, but the only impact is that there were some implicit pressure on prices, which makes it difficult to fully compensate for the increase of the energy costs.

When you've been through portfolio transformation, you get overhead costs. We go, we tackle them. So that has an element of restructuring costs. What we're saying here, as we're looking to prepare the future and really align the organization, we are breaking out cost for a modest increase in restructuring costs. But whatever we do, we do 2 things. We absolutely look for a very rapid payback. We typically talk of less than 2 years cash payback on sub-costs. And secondly, no matter what we do, we will continue to focus on the overall free cash flow of the group. It's about making choices and delivering the cash. And that is what we intend there.

And the second question is around, I guess, the corporate costs and the simplification program. If we benchmark Solvay again on the diversified, I think that for the size of this business, we end up with around EUR 150 million of corporate costs of what would be the benchmark.

If you look at -- traditionally, what we've done is see costs of between EUR 200 million and EUR 250 million in the last few years. When we have divested, we have overhead costs and we tackle them.

What I would say, the benchmark can be simplified as approximately 2% to sales, on top of which, one would typically invest in that we would -- we as an investment for the future of resuming corporate R&I investments. This is a EUR 40 million to EUR 50 million a year. If I take your EUR 150 million and add the EUR 40 million to EUR 50 million of R&I, which is having a good cost, we're very much in the top quartile of those benchmarks, and we intend to continue. The focus, let's say, in preparing this future and realigning our functions to help serve our customers, it's got nothing to do with the cost motivator, at least around the sales growth.

There, we've seen a movement in the direction I just mentioned, which impacted us negatively in '16, '17. We are starting to see guar coming back in the formulation, so that's good news. And it's part of the volume growth that we expect. In terms of pricing, there has been a pressure here and there. We are today seeing a situation, both in mining with Technology Solution and in oil and gas with Novecare, where we have space for price adjustment. That's good. We have also a situation regarding our purchasing conditions. And this impact especially the home and personal care cluster, which have improved significantly. In the last part of 2017, we have negotiated and started new contracts for oleochemical in -- with significantly better conditions after the summer period in 2017, and this will have a full year impact next year.

So I'd say, operationally, we're maintaining the volume, the leadership positions. Yes, there's modest price erosion, something we're not going to quantify.

Essentially, had energy costs been more favorable and going back this way, I think you will see different expectation despite the significant capacity addition. And that's not by accident because we've been planning and anticipating, getting ready for this 2 years now. As far as free cash flow is concerned, I can give you a very simple answer, which is yes. Our free cash flow will exceed financing costs and dividend. One thing to highlight though is we have been working hard, not just in reducing the tax rate, but also the financing charges, and we also indicated that the cash financing charges in '18 will be lower than 2017 as well.

The first one is that we think that in 2017, we've delivered, thanks to a strong volume growth, and we've delivered on all fronts. When I look back at the various objectives that we've set, both in terms of EBITDA growth, but also cash generation, CFROI improvement and even -- although it was not in our objective, but EPS growth is also quite significant, which gives us confidence to raise the dividend as we decided yesterday and the board. 
For 2018, growth will continue to be on the agenda. Growth will accelerate in our core clusters. Unfortunately, we have 2 elements that we need to take into account. One is the foreign exchange that we have discussed. The other one is the situation in soda ash. But there, too, I think we are coming with reassuring news. The fact that we can come with confidence, telling you that the impact will be less than EUR 50 million. It should show that, indeed, as we've been saying for the last quarters, we think that the situation is manageable and under a reasonable level of control. On top of that, a key priority for 2018 is to deliver this more focused, more efficient organization. You will see some news coming in the next few weeks on this front. And overall, reinforced Comex, fully aligned and motivated to make 2018 a very good year for Solvay and for reasons that you understood. It's very important for me, too, to make sure that 2018 indeed is a very good year for the group. 
With that, I thank you. And we'll talk to each other once again on May 3. Probably we'll see some of you on the road in the meantime. But May 3 is our first quarter results presentation. Thank you very much."

And together, we will provide an overview of our first quarter of 2018 results. Just a few other introductions and then I will turn to Karim I will [indiscernible] but this first quarter was very much in line with our expectation. Strong volume growth continued, driven by the advanced Materials and advanced formulation of cluster. As you know much of our Advanced Materials cluster provides lightweighting solutions to our customers in markets like automotive aerospace and few others. We've benefited from this trend in automotive and also a fact that ourproduct gained market share, replacing metals, with either from polymer in a number of applications. So overall, a very good 1 in the automotive segment. Aerospace, composite continued in its growth trajectory, both of the military programs and the commercial ones, generating significant volume growth. Formulation well too, we are focusing their to serve our customers needs in terms of resource efficiency, coat with especially in notable in oil and gas, we serve mostly the nonconventional oil and gas markets in North America and we have seen strong trends there. The only point of attention during this quarter was in this cluster was our mining chemical business, which was flat, compared to last year but in our view it's a temporary situation and we expect a good one for the full year and the segment to. On an organic basis, or EBITDA grew 9% in the first quarter, very much in line with our midterm objective for and this also unfortunately something expected. The a combination of scoped, we had a couple of small transactions, but which waived are now our material because we have not benefited from these transactions and especially for any exchange headwinds, reduced EBITDA by 3% to EUR 533 million. In this context, were able to maintain a strong EBITDA margin of 21%. In an inflationary environment, as far as our material and energy input are concerned, well this is a good sign that we indeed we benefit from significant pricing power in the various markets where we play. We've had Karim, could you provide us with additional sites in our financial [indiscernible] and I will come back with some closing remarks regarding the how we see the year in front of us."

Before I get in to the key aspect of our performance, may be just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press rel",1398,"Of course. Thank you, John-Pierre. Before I get in to the key aspect of our performance, may be just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press release and of course, we supplement that with a comprehensive financial report available on our website. As usual, I will refer to slides that you can access on our websites and the figures that I refer to on an underlying basis. And also reflect the fact that we show the polymer activities as being discontinued. Let's start with sales and perhaps, you can refer to Slide #8. The fact of the matter is net sales have declined 3% in the quarter, but when you exclude the scope and the anticipated foreign change impact of sales increased by 6% year-on-year. Volumes were up 5%, driven by strong growth in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. Volumes grew 6% in Advanced Materials, as we continue to benefit from the light weighting trend, which really is a sustainable mobility. If we look at a high performance polymers, especially in automotive, we see a strong good, fueled by the drive for full efficiency, for electrification of the vehicles. But we also saw good demands in other markets, including health care, suite packaging, electronics, to name but a few. On the composite side of our business, sales volumes grew double-digit on the back of increased production of commercial aircraft, including, give example the Boeing-787 green liner of the 737 MAX and would be continued and anticipated ramp up of the F 35 military program. We've also seen improved demand in helicopter and in the business jets sectors. These developments which we really welcome. The initial side of the business also showed improvements in the quarter and that's mainly linked to high-performance auto programs. If I turn to our Special Chem business, we delivered robust demand growth in the electronic sector and that's supported by our recent capacity expansion and that helped us set a reduction in the demand for oxide in automotive, linked to the shift away from diesel to gasoline engines. Overall, that resulted in a stable volume for that business. 
Turning to Advanced Formulations. Volumes were up 8%, driven by the need for grade to resource efficiency, by, which, I mean that the solutions we developed helped our customers optimize the cost, the yield and the environmental impact of the resources that they're working on. That growth was complemented by higher pricing rule. The continued strength of the North American shale oil and gas market did lead to significant growth versus Q1 last year, when we saw the oil and gas market begin its recovery. That strength was further supported by positive product mix with grade to use of advanced friction reduces by our customers. Turning toward Technology Solutions business. We saw strong demand for our forstery specialties, most notably, foody electronics industry, which we propelled us forward. In mining, market conditions are stable, with good demand for metal extractants, but are volumes at the start of the year were flat, mainly related to order patterns. 
Turning to Performance Chemicals. Volumes were stable overall. We saw solid demand in certain derivatives, but our progress was held back by logistical supply chain constraints, which are linked to a lack of railcar availability in the U.S, which meant that our sales were 4% lower, whereas the margins were very much as planned at beginning of the year, as anticipated. By covenant volumes were stable but also benefited from product mix. On the other side of the equation, we saw a very strong growth in our Curtis business, both in terms of the pricing and volumes as both the domestic and the export markets improved from both solvents and financials. Back to top line. If I turn to slide down and look at the border line and the EBITDAR. In the bridges, you see that the strong volumes are referred to, contributed strongly to our performance or it's sufficient to overcome the adverse impact of Forex in scope. Our is on for exchange where you see EUR 43 million of negative impact. It won't escape your attention that last year is averaged dollar euro exchange rate was 1.065. The equivalent for the quarter Q1, 2018 was 1.229. That $0.16 decline alone using the sensitivity that you're familiar with, it counts for EUR 30 million out of EUR 43 million. There is a ball curve of other currencies that individually are pretty minor or modest but collectively at about EUR 13 million difference or adverse impact and I'm taking here about the Chinese RNB, [indiscernible] the Canadian dollar and even the Saudi Arabian Riyal, for example, where had the peroxide branch. That is part of the headwind that held back our progress. Now if I leave those 2 aspects aside into the scope of foreign-exchange, as Jean has mentioned, our underline EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, organically. We've managed to maintain positive pricing power in this inflationary environment and that more than offset clearly the raw material and that's again due to our ongoing focus on pricing and excellence. In Performance Chemicals, this effect was partly offset by the anticipated pricing environment in the context of new capacity that we anticipated for a while now. Operational excellence did have a very significant impact and a very positive impact on our bottom line. And it helped to feed strong demand at our -- some of our separated plants the bottlenecking and increasing yields helping us reduce variable cost. I'd like to give you one example, where with our Specialty Polymers site in Togu in France, we managed to achieve de-bottlenecking by the deploying of digital advanced analytics that gave us insights and to operating more optimally than before, and that helped to contribute to double-digit increase in our production in the quarter and the market was very, very strong demand. These are the kind of examples that are contributing strongly to our bottom line. As Jean-Pierre peer said, we had managed to sustain our EBITDA margin at 21%, which, as you know, remains in the top quarter for our sector. Showed with earnings PS, our earnings per share on a continuing basis was EUR 2 per share, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects a reduction in our financing [indiscernible] and on our tax rate as well. And you would've noticed that our underlying tax rate was 25% in this quarter, compared to 26% this time last year. Cleared as we move to performance than just profits and EPS, cash is key. And before I say a few words on cash, you will have noticed that we've now extended our normal analysis on our free cash flow by extending it for financial charges, and also for minority dividend, minority risk dividends, really trying to target the fact that our free cash that really matters to many of you is the cash flow available to some our own dividend to our own shareholders. I hope that is a welcome development. It's not new information, it's always been disclosed, we've just taken 1 or 2 steps to make it even easier for you to understand our performance. 
Turning to our performance. We are amending totally focused on free cash, it actually is critical. Our free cash flow was EUR 105 million from our continuing businesses and its lower than last year and that really reflects working capital bills and phasing from 1 quarter to the next. Our CapEx discipline is there, very much there where, I think, EUR 2 million lower than last year, turning in line with our expectations. And may be just worth noting that 2, 3 years ago, you would've seen historically Solyay's net debt increased in the first quarter. Last year we were flat, this year we're flat, in other words, the free cash flow we generate to our Solyay shareholders was adequate to pay for the dividend, interim dividend, that we pay in Q1 as well. As a result, our net debt is stable at EUR 5.3 billion, and that includes EUR 2.2 billion of the perpetual hybrid bonds, meaning we will continue to focus on our cash and fully expect to deliver the free cash flow from continuing operations. And with that, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

But first I want to underline that we have announced, at the end of March, our transformation plan. We have a very simple objective, make sure that we are getting all of Solvay's organzation focused on delivering our solutions to our customers, and we are achieving that for a significant simplification of our organization and key processes. For me, it was an absolute necessity after our very significant confirmation of a portfolio. To make sure that we can benefit indeed from very strong portfolio that we've built over time. So we've promised that we would give you a -- we wish you end result some guidance on what this will represent. We expect this transformation in organization to generate recurrent annual EBITDA contribution of EUR 150 million. We think it will take us 3 years to achieve that. Half of this gains are on head corrections and there were 50% of our lean to efficiency improvement. We are booked -- with this quarter result, one time restructuring cost of EUR 134 million to account for the whole restructuring cost of this organizational transformation. And clearly, for us, the key objective of this improvement is to strengthen our ability to deliver continued growth. We've been quite successful in past years, to create an outstanding customer experience for our limited number of our customers, what we want to do is to make sure that across-the-board, Nordic customers that we serve through our value, we have visibility for differentiated customer experience. 
Turning to the outlook for the rest of 2018, may be just on a personal note, you will know that I will transition out of my current responsibility by the end of the year. I can just tell you that the board is very much on pact as far as the succession processes is concerned. We are currently reviewing candidates, both external and internal, with the objective to have competed the transition process by the year of 2018 and I can tell you that in the meantime, I stay fully committed to make sure that we deliver on the various priorities that we have for 2018, which means that myself and my colleagues from the Solyay are indeed for focused on driving growth in 2018. And we can only confirm after our guidance of going full year, organically, or growing our EBITDA, I should say, organically by between 5% to 7%, by the way, we started with 9% organic growth in the first quarter. Foreign exchange, we will continue to wait on the results in the second quarter. But it's very important that you realize that leaving aside the foreign exchange, organic growth is likely to be weak towards ask the second half of 2018.

And the trend going forward on that, obviously, because a recovery in composite is something you're pointing out some point this year.

Although you said you've positive year-on-year pricing power, I think. And how much potentially is the drag on the Exide, I know Qualcomm is quite important in that businesses as well.

And obviously, the foreign exchange impact, that I was mentioning, it was transactional impact on prices. 
Advanced Formulation, I think, the market, which is going very well, is, as you can imagine, the oil and gas in North America where we see indeed a strong dynamic, mostly driven by friction hedges while we see people showing more interest but it's too early to mention big return of [indiscernible] based  formulation in this segment.

First question is on your change in the organization why you expect EUR 150 million annual savings over a period of 3 years.

And if so can you provide more insights to what is your best guess about the final restructuring costs? And also your best guess of about the related cash outs in total for 2018?

Martin, good afternoon. On the organizational impact, EUR 150 million, may be just to give you a bit of more clarity, more insight is 50% of that is to do with role supression, headcount reduction over time and the other 50% from really deploying different discipline and much more surgical targeted approach around site purchasing and those elements of that nature. So if I go back to broad ballpark benchmark and expect 1 to 2x, if you take half of EUR 150 million and say EUR 75 million is going to be role suppression related, a provision of EUR 130-odd  million, compared to that is very much within what I think is a reasonable ballpark benchmark that you use. So no surprises there. That's may be that extra clarity to give you that confidence. What I would say is well though we expect -- we still had anticipated 7 elements of that in our guidance this year before we gave the guidance beginning of the year. So you don't -- you shouldn't expect anything significant in terms of cash or profits result of our announcements. More generally speaking, the provision we made is noncash at this stage, as you'd expect. I fully expect that the cash out in the restructuring cost we will be matched by the incremental cash savings. So it's going to be broadly cash neutral in Raw Material terms. That is our expectation. And at the end of this, we expect EUR 150 million to be generated and released into the profitability. To your point on free cash flow, EUR 168 million contrasting with EUR 105 million. the simplest answer is this, when you have EUR 4.5 billion of gross working capital. A shift of EUR 20 million, EUR 30 million , EUR 50 million, EUR 70 million is not all exception, very much within the arms of expectations. So if you have high sales in February, slightly softer in March last year and reverse this year, that can have a pretty big impact when you're selling at nearly EUR 800 million in 1 month, it can really boost that. So I'd say it's purely phasing, which is what we've said. If I look at the underline metric and the focus on cash and the working capital discipline, I look at day sales outstanding, it's that. I look at over dues. It's very much in the Green zone, so I'd  say the discipline of being generating and delivering on our [indiscernible] is continuing. So the short answer to your question is that, may be shedding more color to that is less EBITDA has been offset by certainly less cash tax payments and it really is working capital that really is the thing, and that clearly is timing. But as Jean-Pierre said, we reaffirm the cash guidance and that tells you how confident we are. And you know we did it every time we've said it. Hope that helps."

And I think that, to my mind, it has grown but that's not a tool for our over dues or anything. Its is purely the timing of the sales. I welcome that. We certainly have the ability to withstand and finance that kind of very modest-looking capital. As I said, I fully expect Q2 to be equally strong et cetera. So not a tool point of alarm. There is no other business and just aloud that from here but there's no business, which is been in a particular increase in receivables to answer your point. Okay?"

Can you give us an indication if you see any material impacts from this event, which seems to have happened only very recently in terms of production cut? And the second question I had was, again, sorry to come back to the EUR 150 million cost savings, can you give us details on where you're actually cutting cost? Because if you look at your SG&A for 2017, EUR 150 million is almost 9% of that number, which seems pretty high. So would be interested to hear what are the key drivers of EUR 150 million?

On your calculation, again, EUR 150 million savings we've said half of it at correction, half of it are efficiencies. So probably you should take note of -- if you don't take EUR 150 million but EUR 75 million, you'll end up with something which is pretty much in line with the numbers you are mentioning.

So I would hold onto their expectation. It is consistent with our expectation as well. There is also 1 specific factor, which is, at least, we mentioned last year and in our guidance for this year, which is medical retiree benefits last year. It helped us in second quarter. We do expect a repeat benefit but of a much more modest magnitude that will impact the second quarter evolution and growth this year.

And together, we will provide an overview of our first quarter of 2018 results. Just a few other introductions and then I will turn to Karim, I would say that this first quarter was very much in line with our expectation. Strong volume growth continued, driven by the advanced materials and advanced formulation of clusters. As you know much of our Advanced Materials cluster provides lightweighting solutions to our customers in markets like automotive, aerospace and few others. We've benefited from the strength in automotive and also the fact that our product gained market share, replacing metals, with high-performance polymer in a number of applications. So overall, a very good 1 in the automotive segment. Aerospace, composite continued in its growth trajectory, both for the military programs and the commercial ones, generating significant volume growth. Formulation, they are from [indiscernible] we are focusing their to serve our customers' needs in terms of resource efficiency, gulf was especially in notable in oil and gas, we serve mostly the nonconventional oil and gas markets in North America and we have seen a very strong trends there. The only point of attention during this quarter was -- in this cluster was our mining chemical business, which was flat, compared to last year but in our view it's a temporary situation and we expect a good one for the full year and this segment too. On an organic basis, our EBITDA grew 9% in the first quarter, very much in line with our midterm objective, and this was also unfortunately something expected. The combination of scope, we had a couple of small transaction but which waived [indiscernible] because we are not restricted from these transactions and especially for any exchange headwinds, reduced EBITDA by 3% to EUR 533 million. In this context, we are able to maintain a strong EBITDA margin of 21%. In an inflationary environment, as far as raw material and energy input are concerned, well this is a good sign that indeed we benefit from significant pricing power in the various markets where we play. We've had Karim, could you provide us with additional insights in our financial performance and I will come back with some closing remarks regarding the how we see the year in front of us."

Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press relea",1406,"Of course. Thank you, John-Pierre. Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press release and of course, we supplement that with a comprehensive financial report available on our website. As usual, I will refer to slides that you can access on our website and the figures that I refer to are -- on an underlying basis. And also reflect the fact that we show the polymer activities as being discontinued. 
Let's start with sales and perhaps, if we can refer to Slide #8. The fact of the matter is net sales have declined 3% in the quarter, but when you exclude the scope and the anticipated foreign exchange impact, sales increased by 6% year-on-year. Volumes were up 5%, driven by strong growth in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. Volumes grew 6% in Advanced Materials, as we continue to benefit from the lightweighting trend, which really raise a sustainable mobility. If we look at our high-performance polymers, especially in automotive, we see a strong demand, fueled by the drive for fuel efficiency, for electrification of vehicles. But we also saw good demand in other markets, including healthcare, food packaging, electronics, to name but a few. On the composite side of our business, sales volumes grew double digit on the back of increased production of commercial aircraft, including, by way of example the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the 737 MAX and would be continued and anticipated ramp-up of the F-35 military program. We've also seen improved demand in helicopter and in the business jets sectors. These are developments which we really welcome. On the industrial side of the business also showed improvements in the quarter and that's mainly linked to high-performance auto programs. If I turn to our Special Chem business, we delivered robust demand growth in the electronic sector and that's supported by our recent capacity expansions and that helped us set a reduction in the demand for rare earth oxides in automotive, linked to the shift away from diesel to gasoline engines. Overall, that resulted in a stable volume for that business. 
Turning to Advanced Formulations. Volumes were up 8%, driven by the need for greater resource efficiency, by which, I mean that the solutions we developed helped our customers to optimize the cost, the yield and the environmental impact of the resources that they're working on. That growth was complemented by higher pricing rule. The continued strength of the North American shale oil and gas market did lead to significant growth versus Q1 last year, when we saw the oil and gas market begin its recovery. That strength was further supported by positive product mix with greater use of advanced friction reducers by our customers. Turning to our Technology Solutions business. We saw strong demand for our phosphine specialties, most notably for the electronics industry, which we -- propelled us forward. In mining, market conditions are stable, with good demand for metal extractants, but our volumes at the start of the year were flat, mainly related to order patterns. 
Turning to Performance Chemicals. Volumes were stable overall. We saw solid demand in soda ash and derivatives, but our progress was held back by logistical supply chain constraints, which are linked to a lack of railcar availability in the U.S, which meant that our sales were 4% lower, whereas the margins were very much as planned at beginning of the year, as anticipated. Bicarbonate volumes are stable but also benefited from product mix. On the other side of the equation, we saw a very strong growth in our coatis business, both in terms of the pricing and volumes as both the domestic and the export markets improved for both solvents and phenols. Back to top line. If I turn to slide 9 and look at the bottom line on the EBITDA. In the bridge, you see that the strong volumes are referred to -- contributed strongly to our performance are very sufficient to overcome the adverse impact of Forex in scope. I'd say few words on foreign exchange where you see EUR 43 million of negative impact. It won't escape your attention that last year is averaged dollar euro exchange rate was 1.065. The equivalents for the quarter Q1, 2018 was 1.229. That $0.16 decline alone using the sensitivity that you're very familiar with, it counts for EUR 30 million out of EUR 43 million. There is [indiscernible] of other currencies that individually are pretty minor or modest but collectively at about EUR 13 million difference or adverse impact and I'm taking here about the Chinese RNB, Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and even the Saudi Arabian Riyal, for example, where we have the peroxide plant. That is part of the headwind that held back our progress. Now if I leave those 2 aspects aside into the scope of foreign exchange, as Jean has mentioned, our underline EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, organically. We've managed to maintain positive pricing power in this inflationary environment and that more than offset clearly the raw materials and that's again due to our ongoing focus on pricing and excellence. In Performance Chemicals, this effect was partly offset by the anticipated pricing environment in the context of new capacity that we anticipated for a while now. 
Operational excellence did have a very significant impact and a very positive impact on the bottom line. And it helped to feed strong demand at our -- some of our saturated plants, de-bottlenecking and increasing yields helping us to reduce variable cost. I'd like to give you one example, where with our Specialty Polymers site in [indiscernible] in France, we managed to achieve de-bottlenecking by the deployment of digital advanced analytics that gave us insights and to operating more optimally than before, and that helped to contribute to double-digit increase in our production in the quarter and the market with very, very strong demand. These are the kind of examples that are contributing strongly to our bottom line. As Jean-Pierre said, we've managed to sustain our EBITDA margin at 21%, which, as you know, remains in the top quarter for our sector. Showed with earnings PS, our earnings per share on a continuing basis was EUR 2 per share, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects a reduction in our financing charges and on our tax rate as well. And you would've noticed that our underlying tax rate was 25% in this quarter, compared to 26% this time last year. Cleared as we move to performance than just profits and EPS, cash is key. And before I say a few words on cash, you will have noticed that we've now extended our normal analysis on our free cash flow by extending it for financial charges, and also for minority dividend, minority risk dividends, really trying to target the fact that our free cash that really matters to many of you is the cash flow available to some our own dividend to our own shareholders. I hope that is a welcome development. It's not new information, it's always been disclosed, we've just taken 1 or 2 steps to make it even easier for you to understand our performance. 
Turning to our performance. We are remaining totally focused on free cash, it actually is critical. Our free cash flow was EUR 105 million from our continuing businesses and its lower than last year and that really reflects working capital bills and phasing from 1 quarter to the next. Our CapEx discipline is there, very much there -- where, I think EUR 2 million lower than last year, totally in line with our expectations. And may be just worth noting that 2, 3 years ago, you will have seen historically Solvay's net debt increased in the first quarter. Last year we were flat, this year we're flat. In other words, the free cash flow we generate to our Solvay shareholders was adequate to pay for the dividend, interim dividend, that we pay in Q1 as well. As a result, our net debt is stable at EUR 5.3 billion, and that includes EUR 2.2 billion of the perpetual hybrid bonds, meaning we will continue to focus on our cash and fully expect to deliver the free cash flow from continuing operations. And with that, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

But first I want to underline that we have announced, at the end of March, our transformation plan. We have a very simple objective, make sure that we are getting all of Solvay's organization focused on delivering our solutions to our customers, and we are achieving that for a significant simplification of our organization and key processes. For me, it was an absolute necessity of Solvay, very significant confirmation of a portfolio. To make sure that we can benefit indeed from the -- very strong portfolio that we've built overtime. 
So we've promised that we would give you a -- we wish you end result on some guidance on what this will represent. We expect this transformation in organization to generate recurrent annual EBITDA contribution of EUR 150 million. We think it will take us 3 years to achieve that. Half of these gains are a contradiction and there were 50% of our lean to efficiency improvement. We have booked with this quarter result, onetime restructuring cost of EUR 134 million to account for the whole restructuring cost of this organizational transformation. And clearly, for us, the key objective of this improvement is to strengthen our ability to deliver continued growth. We've been quite successful in past years, to create an outstanding customer experience for our limited number of our customers, what we want to do is to make sure that across-the-board, Novecare customers that we serve throughout our [indiscernible] crystal, we have feasibility of differentiated customer experience. 
Turning to the outlook for the rest of 2018, may be just on a personal note, you will know that I will transition out of my current responsibility by the end of the year. I can just tell you that the board is very much impact as far as the succession processes is concerned. We are currently reviewing candidates, both external and internal, with the objective to have competed the transition process by the end of 2018 and I can tell you that in the meantime, I stay fully committed to make sure that we deliver on the various priorities that we have for 2018, which means that myself and my colleagues from the [indiscernible]  are indeed focused on driving growth in 2018. And we can only confirm of to use guidance of going full year, organically, our growing our EBITDA, I should say, organically by between 5% and 7%, by the way, we started with 9% organic growth in the first quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to ways on the results in the second quarter. But -- and it's very important that you realize that leaving aside the foreign exchange, organic growth is likely to be ways towards the second half of 2018. And with that, we are now with Karim in a position to take your questions."

And obviously, the foreign exchange impact, that I was mentioning, it was transactional impact on prices. Advanced Formulation, I think, the market, which is going very well, is, as you can imagine, the oil and gas in North America where we see indeed a very strong dynamic, mostly driven by friction reducers, while we see people showing more interest but it's too early to mention big return of guar base formulation in this segment. I mentioned that the Technology Solution business especially mining was a bit soft during the quarter but forex is more phasing than subject that we should really worried about on the non oil and gas businesses at Novecare, frankly speaking, not much to comment. We've seen, as usual, a mix of pluses and minuses there, but no specific plan. I think the -- I think in Novecare, we're probably at a point of stem where our focus should be on margin, and yes, we expect to be able to benefit from very dynamic market in some of our segment to be able to improve our margins.

The second question is on, especially for Karim on free cash flow from continuing operations. And in your quarterly report, you show that this figure drops by 37% year-over-year from EUR 168 million to EUR 105 million. In your presentation, on Slide 11, you show the free cash flow from continuing operations and attributable to shareholders was basically flat from EUR 102 million to EUR 99 million.

Martin, good afternoon. On the organizational impact, EUR 150 million, may be just to give you a bit of more clarity, more insight to,  50% of that is to do with role suppression, headcount reduction over time and the other 50% from really deploying different discipline and much more surgical targeted approach around site purchasing inverse elements of that nature. So if I go back to broad ballpark benchmark and I expect 1 to 2x, if you take half of EUR 150 million and say EUR 75 million is going to be role suppression related, a provision of EUR 130-odd  million, compared to that is very much within what I think is a reasonable ballpark benchmark that you use. So no surprises there. That's may be the extra clarity gives you that confidence. What I would say is well though is we expect -- we still had anticipated 7 elements of that in our guidance this year before we gave the guidance beginning of the year. So you don't -- you shouldn't expect anything significant in terms of cash or profits result of our announcements. More generally speaking, the provision we made is noncash at this stage, as you'd expect. I fully expect that the cash out in any restructuring cost will be matched by the incremental cash savings. 
So it's going to be broadly cash neutral in Raw Material terms. That is our expectation. And at the end of this, we expect EUR 150 million to be generated and released into the profitability. To your other point on free cash flow, EUR 168 million contrasting with EUR 105 million, the simplest answer is this, when you have EUR 4.5 billion of gross working capital. A shift of EUR 20 million, EUR 30 million , EUR 50 million, EUR 70 million from one month to another is not too exceptional, very much within the rounds of expectations. So if you have high sales in February, slightly softer in March last year and reverse this year, that can have a pretty big impact when you're selling at nearly EUR 800 million in 1 month, it can really boost that. So I'd say it's purely phasing, which is what we've said. And if I look at the underline metric and the focus on cash and its working capital discipline, I look at day sales outstanding, it's that. I look at all the dues. It's very much in the green zone, so I'd  say the discipline of being generating and delivering our [indiscernible] is continuing. So the short answer to your question is that, may be shedding more color to that is less EBITDA has been offset by certainly less cash tax payments and it really is working capital, that really is the thing and that clearly is timing. But as Jean-Pierre said, we've reaffirm the cash guidance and that tells you how confident we are. And you know we did it within every time we've said it. Hope that helps."

Fundamentally we delivered strong volume growth. We are growing our business in. But fundamentally what I would say is despite the fact we moved our sales up 6%, our EBIDTA 9%, on a like-for-like and organic basis, so we can't defy gravity. So foreign exchange have taken that plus 9% EBIDTA down to minus 3%. Not a surprise.  We flagged that at the end of February. But that is a key feature that you would have taken note of. 
If I look at the volume growth and where is it coming from, to me, in many ways it talks about the fact that the transformation that we had been working on the transformation that we've been working on for the few years is beginning to bear fruit. I say that because I see very strong volume growth in Specialty Polymers and Composites that have driven a 9% organic EBIDTA growth in the Advanced Materials segment. 
What's also really worth noting is that this is addressing the lightweight and the sustainable mobility solutions and the contribution we are making to that space. We are leaders there. In terms of the aerospace, in terms of the aeronautics composites. The F35, the Boeing 787, the 737 platform. If I look at high-performance polymers, it's really broad based, Automotive is propelling us forward as well. So Advanced Materials is a big tick. Lot of good progress. 
Advanced Formulations actually did have an even stronger quarter with double-digit organic EBITDA growth. Pretty broad-based as well. Quite diversified markets that we serve. I say the volume growth was led by oil and gas in the Novacare business. We also saw the technology solutions generate strong growth in phosphorus and polymer additives. So that's really what moved us forward. 
Performance Chemicals we knew was going to be going through a bit of transition with new capacity that's now stream, but is performing very much in a solid way in a market that still is quite supportive. Any margin erosion is being contained and fundamentally delivering as we anticipated. 
That performance in the first 100 days of the year has given us the confidence to reconfirm the outlook that we gave. To remind you, that outlook indicates growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis. I can't predict what exchange rates are going to do. also said is no matter what happens to our EBITDA, we will deliver a stronger free cash flow from our continuing businesses. 
Final point to note is we'll recognize that the portfolio transformation of Solvay is largely behind us. But there is a new transformation that really was announced and has to do with the realignment of our functions to make us lot more agile. And is to adapt to our business portfolio and really adapt to where we do business with our evolving customers. We made announcement on the 29th of March about the organizational update. What you see today is the fact that to enable us to make it happen, we made a provision of EUR 134 million, that will be payable and spent like over the next 3 years. What's really important is at the end of 3 years of profitability as a consequence of that will be minimum of EUR 150 million higher to the cost of. But that's not really the driver. The real driver is to enable us to underpin superior growth -- organic growth. And that's really why we are doing to this. With that, I'll take your questions. Who would like to go first?"

So we essentially have a merely just over 16 cents difference. That alone if you just look at the mechanistic impact, that alone in Q1 is about EUR 30 million. Now there's more to it than dollar. That's one most in our results in Q1. I've got the impact of the Chinese RMB, the Brazilian reais, even the with a plant, all of that has conspired against and essentially contributed in another EUR 10 million-or-so to our negative impact in Q1. That's a first point to make. If I look at the of exchange rates last year, Q2, the average dollar-euro exchange rate was 1.10; Q3, Q4 was 1.17. We averaged the year at 1.13. We started the year at 1.25. And we gave an indication as to the foreign exchange for the full year of EUR 125 million. That's what we said in the February. At the moment, I'm not going to celebrate the fact that the dollar-euro is 1.20 because you know what, these things have a habit of turning very, very fast. If you look at various economic expectations from banks and others, it's still 1.25 range. So one has to be cautious. I'm not in a position to say the world has moved sufficiently for me to vary from the guidance I gave from the beginning of the year. What I would say is the comps Q2 would be somewhat narrower than Q1. And similarly for Q3, Q4 as well, if exchange rates remain as they're. So I don't think I can predict exchange rates beyond this other than say we anticipating certain set of conditions. What I tried to do is not to try and predict absolute results. That's why we are going for this organic growth because we will control, we can control sales, costs, cash and we will demonstrate impact, we will illustrate the impacts of evolution of exchange rates, which will be done.

What it essentially means and this is something we probably have more exposure than others. Because we have a much more substantial U.S. business compared to our past and compared to many of our peers, particularly with the acquisition of Cytec over 2 years ago. That means our U.S. profits are worth less in euros than previously. That is essentially what we are talking about, as a prime example. If i said it differently EUR 100 million of profits last year would have been worth roughly EUR 92 million. This year it will be worth less than exactly -- I can't do math but we are taking EUR 80-something million. So that is purely mechanistic. It's just the math. Equity investors understand. This is part of the value proposition for their investments. But the key point to note in all of this is to go beyond the, call it, gravity.

So I would like to be prepared for those eventualities about trade prices to sanctions on Russia, for example. We heard the news about Rusal. Rusal is a customer of Solvay. Again, not huge. But every little bit can count. So we have to meet our customer's needs, provided we can do so legally. So again if sanctions environment change, then we can escape some of these effects. But again, none of that at this point is material to us. The real point we are in an environment which  has more geopolitical uncertainly perhaps in the past. What I'm reassured by, and that's why actually had a very diversified portfolio. It takes a lot to knock holes into our performance. It takes a lot. So I'm not sitting here losing sleep. Long answer to an important short question. I hope it helps.
And maybe stating the obviously. We don't like protectionism. We think business, value, economies are best served with a professional measures. Because ultimately everything is a global supply chain. We are all interconnected. But again, I don't want to get into the political territory of this other than say the business likes free-trade. Tariffs, free-trade. Sorry, I think there is question. So let's go to those."

Whether  one wins or the other, I'm not going to pronounce myself. I don't think it's up to me to talk about the composite wing of Airbus compared to Boeing. What I would say is all of those platforms are poised, in our view, for growth. Just yesterday, I have seen Qantas' announcement it was going to retire 747 fleet and replace it by the 787, the Dreamliner. I think the 787 is what you meant rather than 797.  Something. It's a wonderful aircraft and really makes a difference. A 10-hour journey feels like a 2-hour European hop. Totally, totally different. And I can see the most of the -- because the user experience better. So Airbus has the same. The Bombardier I think is an interesting question. I think the C Series complements the offerings ultimately to the Airbus. The fact that there is this mutual interest I think it's helpful. I think C Series is stronger with the Airbus connection than without. So to us, it's positive. I'd say it doesn't have an impact short term. I'd like to think it was different. But I think, a lot of these things one has to be patient. And everything I have seen, everything I have seen in the last couple of years reaffirms the beliefs that we have, the convictions we have, the choices we made to get into composites is the right one, because I think these are really poised for slow, steady, but very, very attractive growth over time."

You can see was a magnitude business on each platform, 787, et cetera, means to Solvay. But that's also why I think folks understand and have confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time in composites. But those who appreciate it doesn't happen as quickly as we see, for example, on our Specialty Polymers business. Fundamentally what I would say that is if you look back over time, you go back 10, 20 years, the composites penetration was in the order of 10% to 15%. We are now to the 40% to 50% range. So composite is displacing metal. Composite is displacing even aluminum. For an example, my understanding on Airbus when the Rusal U.S. sanctions against Russia, when Rusal was a target. And I know that the main shareholder there is looking to reduce the shares and try and get away from that constraint. That's the problems for people like Airbus and Boeing and others because they are dependent on companies like Rusal to provide their aluminum. But even if they can't get the aluminum, you can't put composites quickly. These are generational changes. But fundamentally the growth has gone from 10%, 15% to 40% to 50%. I'm not suggesting it will go to 70%, 80%, 90%, I don't know.  But even at 50% plus for the next 10, 15 years is excellent business. Excellent, excellent business."

And together, we will provide an overview of our first quarter of 2018 results. Just a few other introductions and then I will turn to Karim.
I would say that this first quarter was very much in line with our expectation. Strong volume growth continued, driven by the Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation clusters. As you know much of our Advanced Materials cluster provides lightweighting solutions to our customers in markets like automotive, aerospace and a few others. We've benefited from the strength in automotive and also the fact that our product gained market share, replacing metals with high-performance polymer in a number of applications. So overall, a very good run in the automotive segment. Aerospace, composite continued in its growth trajectory, both for the military programs and the commercial ones, generating significant volume growth. Formulation performed well too. We are focusing there to serve our customers' needs in terms of resource efficiency. Growth was especially notable in oil and gas. We serve mostly the nonconventional oil and gas markets in North America and we have seen a very strong trends there. The only point of attention during this quarter was -- in this cluster was our mining chemical business, which was flat compared to last year, but in our view it's a temporary situation and we expect a good run for the full year and this segment too.
On an organic basis, our EBITDA grew 9% in the first quarter, very much in line with our midterm objective [ fall ], and this was also unfortunately something expected. The combination of scope, we had a couple of small transaction but which weighed on our EBITDA because we have not restated for these transactions. And especially for an exchange headwinds, reduced EBITDA by 3% to EUR 533 million. In this context, we are able to maintain a strong EBITDA margin of 21%. In an inflationary environment, as far as raw material and energy input are concerned, well this is a good sign that indeed we benefit from significant pricing power in the various markets where we play.
With that, Karim, could you provide us with additional insights in our financial performance and I will come back with some closing remarks regarding the -- how we see the year in front of us."

Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press relea",1403,"Of course. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press release. Well, of course, we supplement that with a comprehensive financial report available on our website. As usual, I will refer to slides that you can access on our website and the figures that I refer to are on an underlying basis, and also reflect the fact that we show the polymer activities as being discontinued. 
Let's start with sales and perhaps, if we can refer to Slide #8. The fact of the matter is net sales have declined 3% in the quarter, but when you exclude the scope and the anticipated foreign exchange impact, sales increased by 6% year-on-year. Volumes were up 5%, driven by strong growth in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. Volumes grew 6% in Advanced Materials, as we continue to benefit from the lightweighting trend, which really raise a sustainable mobility. If we look at our high-performance polymers, especially in automotive, we see a strong demand, fueled by the drive for fuel efficiency, for electrification of vehicles. But we also saw good demand in other markets, including healthcare, food packaging, electronics, to name but a few. On the composite side of our business, sales volumes grew double digit on the back of increased production of commercial aircraft, including, by way of example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the 737 MAX, and would be continued, an anticipated ramp-up of the F-35 military program. We've also seen improved demand in helicopter and in the business jets sectors. These are developments which we really welcome. The industrial side of the business also showed improvements in the quarter, and that's mainly linked to high-performance auto programs.
If I turn to our Special Chem business, we delivered robust demand growth in the electronic sector and that's supported by our recent capacity expansions. And that helped us set a reduction in the demand for rare earth oxides in automotive, linked to the shift away from diesel to gasoline engines. Overall, that resulted in a stable volume for that business. 
Turning to Advanced Formulations. Volumes were up 8%, driven by the need for greater resource efficiency, by which I mean that the solutions we developed helped our customers to optimize the cost, the yield and the environmental impact of the resources that they're working on. That growth was complemented by higher pricing overall. The continued strength of the North American shale oil and gas market did lead to significant growth versus Q1 last year, when we saw the oil and gas market begin its recovery. That strength was further supported by positive product mix with greater use of advanced friction reducers by our customers.
Turning to our Technology Solutions business. We saw strong demand for our phosphine specialties, most notably for the electronics industry, which really propelled us forward. In mining, market conditions are stable, with good demand for metal extractants, but our volumes at the start of the year were flat, mainly related to order patterns. 
Turning to Performance Chemicals. Volumes were stable overall. We saw solid demand in soda ash and derivatives, but our progress was held back by logistical supply chain constraints, which are linked to a lack of railcar availability in the U.S, which meant that our sales were 4% lower, whereas the margins were very much as planned at beginning of the year, as anticipated. Bicarbonate volumes were stable but also benefited from product mix. On the other side of the equation, we saw a very strong growth in our Coatis business, both in terms of pricing and volumes, as both the domestic and the export markets improved for both solvents and phenols.
Back to top line. If I turn to Slide 9 and look at the bottom line on the EBITDA, in the bridge, you see that the strong volumes I refer to contributed strongly to our performance but were insufficient to overcome the adverse impact of Forex in scope. I'll say a few words on foreign exchange, where you see EUR 43 million of negative impact. It won't escape your attention that last year's averaged dollar euro exchange rate was 1.065. The equivalent for the quarter, Q1 2018, was 1.229. That $0.16 decline alone using the sensitivity that you're very familiar with, accounts for EUR 30 million out of EUR 43 million. There is a basket of other currencies that individually are pretty minor or modest, but collectively adds about EUR 13 million difference or adverse impact, and I'm taking here about the Chinese RNB, Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and even the Saudi Arabian riyal, for example, where we have the peroxide plant. That is part of the headwind that held back our progress. Now if I leave those 2 aspects aside into the scope of foreign exchange, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, our underlying EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, organically. We've managed to maintain positive pricing power in this inflationary environment and that more than offset clearly the raw materials. And that's again due to our ongoing focus on pricing and excellence. In Performance Chemicals, this effect was partly offset by the anticipated pricing environment in the context of new capacity that we anticipated for a while now. 
Operational excellence did have a very significant impact and a very positive impact on the bottom line. And it helped to feed strong demand at our -- some of our saturated plants, de-bottlenecking and increasing yields helping us reduce variable cost. I'd like to give you one example, where with our Specialty Polymers site in Tavaux in France, we managed to achieve de-bottlenecking by the deployment of digital advanced analytics that gave us insights into operating more optimally than before, and that helped to contribute to double-digit increase in our production in the quarter in a market with very, very strong demand. These are the kind of examples that are contributing strongly to our bottom line. As Jean-Pierre said, we've managed to sustain our EBITDA margin at 21%, which, as you know, remains in the top quartile for our sector.
Short word on earnings PS, our earnings per share on a continuing basis was EUR 2 per share, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects a reduction in our financing charges and on our tax rate as well. And you would've noticed that our underlying tax rate was 25% in this quarter, compared to 26% this time last year. Clearly there's more to performance than just profits and EPS. Cash is key. And before I say a few words on cash, you will have noticed that we've now extended our normal analysis on our free cash flow by extending it for financial charges, and also for minority dividend, minority [ with ] dividend, really trying to target the fact that our free cash for that really matters to many of you as the cash flow available to fund our own dividend to our own shareholders. I hope that is a welcome development. It's not new information; it's always been disclosed. We've just taken 1 or 2 steps to make it even easier for you to understand our performance. 
Turning to our performance. We are remaining totally focused on free cash. It actually is critical. Our free cash flow was 108 -- EUR 105 million from our continuing businesses. And it was lower than last year, and that really reflects working capital bills and phasing from 1 quarter to the next. Our CapEx discipline is there, very much there. We're, I think, EUR 2 million lower than last year, totally in line with our expectations. And may be just worth noting that 2, 3 years ago, you will have seen historically Solvay's net debt increased in the first quarter. Last year we were flat, this year we're flat. In other words, the free cash flow we generate to our Solvay shareholders was adequate to pay for the dividend, interim dividend that we pay in Q1 as well. As a result, our net debt is stable at EUR 5.3 billion, and that includes EUR 2.2 billion of the perpetual hybrid bonds. Clearly we will continue to focus on our cash and fully expect to deliver the free cash flow from continuing operations. And with that, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

But first I want to underline that we have announced, at the end of March, our transformation plan. We have a very simple objective, make sure that we are getting all of Solvay's organization focused on delivering our solutions to our customers, and we are achieving that for a significant simplification of our organization and key processes. For me, it was an absolute necessity of Solvay, very significant confirmation of the portfolio to make sure that we can benefit indeed from the very strong portfolio that we've built over time. 
So we've promised that we would give you a -- we'd issue a result on some guidance on what this will represent. We expect this transformation in organization to generate a recurrent annual EBITDA contribution of EUR 150 million. We think it will take us 3 years to achieve that. Half of these gains are on headcount reductions and the other 50% are lean proficiency improvements. We have booked, with this quarter result, a onetime restructuring cost of EUR 134 million to account for the restructuring cost of this organizational transformation. And clearly, for us, the key objective of this improvement is to strengthen our ability to deliver continued growth. We've been quite successful in past years to create an outstanding customer experience for our limited number of our customers. What we want to do is to make sure that, across-the-board, know that customers that we serve throughout our various cluster, we have visibility of a differentiated customer experience. 
Turning to the outlook for the rest of 2018, maybe just on a personal note, you will know that I will transition out of my current responsibility by the end of the year. I can just tell you that the board is very much on track as far as the succession process is concerned. We are currently reviewing candidates, both external and internal, with the objective to have completed the transition process by the end of 2018. And I can tell you that in the meantime, I stay fully committed to make sure that we deliver on the various priorities that we have for 2018, which means that myself and my colleagues from the [indiscernible] are indeed focused on driving growth in 2018. And we can only confirm our previous guidance of growing full year organically -- growing our EBITDA, I should say, organically by between 5% and 7%. By the way, we started with 9% organic growth in the first quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to weighs on the results in the second quarter. But -- and it's very important that you realize that leaving aside the foreign exchange, organic growth is likely to be weighed towards the second half of 2018. And with that, we are now with Karim in a position to take your questions."

So I'm just wondering with price and mix, what's happening there? Is there some recovery in some lower-margin business? And the trend going forward on that, obviously, because a recovery in composites is something you're pointing out some point this year. And then in Advanced Formulations, again, using my numbers anyway, I get the ex oil and gas business down sharply on margin. And I'm trying to wonder how much that might be the raw material squeeze, although you said you have positive year-on-year pricing power, I think, and how much potentially is the drag on the Ag side, and I know guar gum is quite important in that businesses as well. And then tied with that, I guess, the guar on the oil and gas, whether we're actually seeing this coming through as expected on a gentle recovery path."

I mean, the project like the F-35 or some of the ramp-up of the single-aisle large commercial F plane is indeed generating this increase in volumes. Karim mentioned also that other markets like helicopter are going well. Regarding the price impact, prices are pretty stable in local currency in this business, but obviously, as you can imagine, a significant part of this business is U.S. dollar driven. But overall again, the good news as we enter into 2018 is the fact that we have very good volume behavior. And obviously, the foreign exchange impact that I was mentioning, it was transactional impact on prices.
Advanced Formulation, I think the market, which is going very well, is, as you can imagine, the oil and gas in North America where we see indeed a very strong dynamic, mostly driven by friction reducers. While we see people showing more interest, but it's too early to mention big return of guar base formulation in this segment. I mentioned that the Technology Solutions business, especially mining, was a bit soft during the quarter, but Forex is more phasing, a subject that we should clearly worry about. On the non oil and gas businesses at Novecare, frankly speaking, not much to comment. We've seen, as usual, a mix of pluses and minuses there, but no specific plan. I think the -- I think in Novecare, we're probably at a point of stem where our focus should be on margin, and yes, we expect to be able to benefit from a very dynamic market in some of our segment to be able to improve our margins.

First question is on your change in the organization, why you expect EUR 150 million annual savings over a period of 3 years? Normally, that is related with onetime cost with a factor of 1 to 2, which would normally mean EUR 150 million to EUR 300 million onetime cost. You booked EUR 134 million in Q1. Is it fair to say that additional restructuring costs will be booked in the course of 2018 and eventually in 2019? And if so, can you provide more insights on what is your best guess about the final restructuring costs? And also your best guess about the related cash-outs in total for 2018? You expect some EUR 18 million cash-outs from that restructuring, but certainly that's not the final figure. And related to that, regarding the savings, I would like to know what is your guess about the retention rate, so I mean how much can you keep and how much you have to share with your customers? The second question is on, especially for Karim, on free cash flow from continuing operations. And in your quarterly report, you show that this figure drops by 37% year-over-year from EUR 168 million to EUR 105 million. In your presentation, on Slide 11, you show the free cash flow from continuing operations and attributable to shareholders was basically flat, from EUR 102 million to EUR 99 million. I would like to understand the delta in the last year's figure between this EUR 168 million and the EUR 102 million."

Martin, on the organizational impact, EUR 150 million, maybe just to give you a bit of more clarity, more insight to, 50% of that is to do with role suppression, call it, headcount reduction over time, and the other 50% from really deploying different discipline and much more surgical, targeted approach around site purchasing and various elements of that nature. So if I go back to a broad ballpark benchmark and I expect 1 to 2x, if you take half of EUR 150 million and say 75% -- EUR 75 million is going to be role suppression related, a provision of EUR 130-odd million compared to that is very much within what I think is a reasonable ballpark benchmark that you use. So no surprise there. Perhaps maybe that extra clarity gives you that confidence. What I would say as well though is that we expect -- we still had anticipated a certain element of that in our guidance this year before we gave the guidance beginning of the year. So you don't -- you shouldn't expect anything significant in terms of cash or profits a result of our announcements. More generally speaking, the provision we made is noncash at this stage, as you'd expect. I fully expect that the cash-out in any restructuring cost will be matched by the incremental cash savings. So it's going to be broadly cash neutral in all material terms. That is our expectation. And at the end of this, we expect EUR 150 million to be generated and released into the profitability.
To your other point, on free cash flow, EUR 168 million contrasting with EUR 105 million, the simplest answer is this: When you have EUR 4.5 billion of gross working capital, a shift of EUR 20 million, EUR 30 million, EUR 50 million, EUR 70 million from one month to another is not at all exceptional, very much within the realms of expectations. So if you have high sales in February, slightly softer in March last year and reverse this year, that can have a pretty big impact. When you're selling at nearly EUR 800 million in any one month, it can really boost that. So I'd say it's purely phasing, which is what we've said. And if I look at the underline metric and the focus on cash and its working capital discipline, I look at day sales outstanding, it's that. I look at overdues. It's very much in the green zone, so I'd say the discipline of we generating and delivering rough news is continuing. So the short answer to your question is that, maybe assigning more color to that is less EBITDA has been offset by certainly less cash tax payments, and it really is working capital, that really is the thing, and that clearly is timing. But as Jean-Pierre said, we've reaffirmed our cash guidance and that tells you how confident we are. And you know we did it within every time we've said it. Hope that helps."

So I hope that gives you an indication why the cash is much smaller than the P&L impact. As far as the other part of your question, on receivables, there's nothing that particularly that stands out as an outlier. What I would say is the strong performance you've seen in Advanced Formulations with 10% advancement was pretty much back-ended in the quarter. And I think that, to my mind, says it's grown but that's not at all part of our overdues or anything we announced. It's purely the timing of the sales. I welcome that. We certainly have the ability to withstand and finance that kind of very modest-looking capital build. As I said, I fully expect Q2 to be equally strong, et cetera. So not at all a point of alarm. There's no other business. I'm just thinking aloud if I'm here, but there's no other business we're interested in  being in if a particular re-increase in receivables, to answer your point."

There is also one specific factor, which is -- and we've mentioned it both last year and in our guidance for this year, which is medical retiree benefits last year. It helped us in second quarter.

giving you the overview of our Q1 results. And obviously, the main point of today is to take your questions.
Fundamentally, we've delivered strong volume growth. We are growing our businesses, and I'll come to it. But fundamentally, what I would say is despite the fact we moved our sales up 6%, our EBIDTA 9% on a like-for-like and an organic basis. So we can't defy gravity. So foreign exchange have taken that plus 9% EBIDTA down to minus 3%. Not a surprise. We flagged that at the end of February, but that is a key feature that you would have taken note of.
If I look at the volume growth and where is it coming from, to me, in many ways, it talks about the fact that the transformation that we've been working on for the past few years is beginning to bear fruit. I say that because I see very strong volume growth in specialty polymers and composites that have driven a 9% organic EBIDTA growth in the Advanced Materials segment.
What's also really worth noting is that this is addressing the lightweighting, the sustainable mobility solutions and the contribution we're making to that space. We are leaders there. In terms of aerospace, in terms of aeronautics composites, the F-35, the Boeing 787, the 737 platform.
If I look at high-performance polymers, it's really broad based. Automotive is propelling us forward as well. So Advanced Materials, a big tick, a lot of good progress.
Advanced Formulations actually had an even stronger quarter with double-digit organic EBITDA growth, pretty broad based as well, quite diversified markets that we serve. I'd say the volume growth was led by oil and gas in the Novecare business. We also saw the technology solutions generate strong growth in phosphorus and polymer additives. So that's really what's moved us forward.
Performance Chemicals, we knew was going to be going through a bit of a transition with the new capacity that's now onstream but is performing very much in a solid way in a market that still is quite supportive. Any margin erosion is being contained, and fundamentally, it's delivering as we anticipated.
That performance in the first 100 days of the year has given us the confidence to reconfirm the outlook that we gave. To remind you, that outlook indicates growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis. I can't predict what exchanges are going to do. And we also said is no matter what happens to our EBITDA, we will deliver a stronger free cash flow from our continuing businesses.
Final point to note is we'll recognize that the portfolio transformation of Solvay is largely behind us, but there is a new transformation that really was announced and has to do with the realignment of our functions to make us a lot more agile and as to adapt to our business portfolio and really adapt to where we do business with our evolving customers.
We made an announcement on the 29th of March about the organizational update. What you see today is the fact that to enable us to make it happen, we made a provision of EUR 134 million. That will be payable and spent, if you like, over the next 3 years. What's really important is, at the end of those 3 years, our profitability as a consequence of that will be minimum of EUR 150 million higher to the cost reduction. But that's not really the driver. The real driver is to enable us to underpin superior growth -- organic growth. And that's really why we're doing to this.
With that, I'll take your questions. Who'd like to go first?"

So the fact that Roger's leaving essentially for personal reasons. He's been out of the U.S. His kids, his family are in the U.S.  They've left school, university, so going back and fundamentally, it's a quality-of-life choice as I understand it. I regret that. I really appreciated Roger. But to my mind, I salute and commend the fact that he's making these choices. I think many of us do in Solvay as well. The extensions are really bringing some more diverse experiences. We've got Cécile de Marsac that adds a bit of gender diversity, and it's interesting because that adds a bit of a feminine touch on some of the questions we ask ourselves. And I really like that. It's a different challenge. We got 2 business, real industrial operators, Augusto Di Donfrancesco that was running the Specialty Polymers business. And if I can think of a turbo charger, Augusto being much close to that, very, very business driven, bottom line driven, very, very -- has diversity in a way, complementarity to the existing profiles. And you got Hua Du, who's Chinese, was Asia based, very, very close and a different way to look at the business. So Hua Du, for example, is going to be primarily looking at beyond the supervision responsibilities he's got. He'll be looking at enabling us to grow even better in the Asian markets. And I think, again, we're asking ourselves slightly different questions as a result of that. So I'd say is we're not standing still. We're not dependent on any one individual be it Rogers, Jean-Pierre or anybody else. This is a very broad based, deep -- the deep bench, and we're moving. Does that help?"

But the suppressions are really happening in the corporate and the shared service functions. The idea really is to put as many of our functional resources, our experts in the global business units directly much closer to the front line, have a much lighter corporate touch. Anything we do from a corporate point of view has got to be very, very much and is very much defined by is it a critical part of our governance policy standard setting or about offering an expertise that has to be shared and is a source of competitive advantage. Innovations, excellence are 2 examples of that, where we are going to leverage on that much more clearly. So essentially, what it means is a leaner corporate but much more focused on the things that matter the most to the bottom line. We're not going to try and be perfect and excellent at every single thing. We're going to be more pragmatic. I like the term 80-20.

Q1 last year had an average dollar-euro exchange rate to $1.065. This year, it's $1.229. Let's say $1.23. So we essentially have a merely just over $0.16 difference. That alone -- if you just look at the mechanistic impact, that alone in Q1 is about EUR 30 million. Now there's more to it than dollar. That's one that's weighed the most in our results in Q1. I've got the impact of the Chinese RMB, the Brazilian reais. Even the sad real with our peroxides plant, all of that has conspired against and essentially contributed another EUR 10 million or so to our negative impact in Q1. That's the first point to make. If I look at the evolution of exchange rates last year, Q2, the average dollar-euro exchange rate was $1.10. Q3, Q4 was $1.17. We averaged the year at $1.13. We started the year at $1.25, and we gave an indication as to the foreign exchange for the full year of EUR 125 million. That's what we said in the February. At the moment, I'm not going to celebrate the fact that the dollar-euro is at $1.20 because, you know what, these things have a habit of turning very, very fast. If we look at various economic expectations from banks and others, they're still in the $1.25 range. Certainly, one has to be cautious. I'm not in a position to say the world has moved sufficiently for me to vary from the guidance I gave at the beginning of the year. What I would say is the comps Q2 will be somewhat narrower than Q1 and similarly for Q3, Q4 as well if exchange rates remain as they are. So I don't think I can predict exchange rates beyond this other than say to you we're anticipating a certain set of conditions. What I tried to do is not to try and predict absolute results. That's why we're going for this organic growth because we will control what we can control, sales, cost, cash, and we will demonstrate what was impact -- we will illustrate the impacts of evolution of exchange rates, which is what we've done. Does that help?"

It impacts revenues but also impacts favorably to a point some of our costs net-net and does impact our EBITDA, absolutely. What it essentially means, and this is something we probably have more exposure than others, because we have a much more substantial U.S. business compared to our past and compared to many of our peers, particularly with the acquisition of Cytec over 2 years ago, that means our U.S. profits are worth less in euros than previously. That is essentially what we're talking about as a prime example. If I said it differently, $100 million of profits last year would have been worth roughly EUR 92 million. This year, it will be worth a lot less than -- I can't do math arithmetically, but we're taking EUR 80-something million, so -- and is purely mechanistic. It's just the maths. Equity investors understand though. This is part of the value proposition for their investments. But the key point to note in all of this is to go beyond the, call it, gravity, not foreign exchange rate I can't control or predict and focus on the fact that the machine is delivering. There is strong volume growth. It's not new news. Obviously, this has been happening now for the last quite a few quarters, 6 quarters sequentially from memory.

I'd say it's not going to be hugely material on our business, but it will have an impact, yes. Our first reaction will be to try to mitigate through pricing, et cetera, but let's see. But to answer your point, no, it doesn't keep me awake because it's relatively modest. I'd say these are part of the knocks in business we have to adapt. So it'll have an impact but not huge ultimately. But once we see those things being confirmed, if they happen, then, clearly, if there's any significant impact on our short-term expectations, we'll advise the market in due course. But there's not one for now for me. But I would say it's not about being complacent. We are vigilant. I've got the list of the hundred-plus [ industrial ] products. We know where we could be impacted. We looked at our supply chain. So I would like to be prepared for those eventualities. We talk about trade, but the same applies to sanctions on Russia for example. We heard the news about Rusal. Rusal is a customer of Solvay. Again, not huge but every little bit can count. So we're there to meet our customers' needs provided we can do so legally. So again, if sanctions environment change, then these -- we can escape some of these effects. But again, none of that at this point is material to us. The real point is we're in an environment which has more geopolitical uncertainty perhaps than we've seen in the past. What I am reassured by, and that's why I say pleasingly, is that we have a very diversified portfolio. It takes a lot to knock holes into our performance. It really takes a lot. So I'm not sitting here losing sleep. Long answer to an important short question, I hope it helps. And maybe one final thing. At the risk of stating the obvious, we don't like protectionism. We think business, value, economies are best served without protectionist measures because, ultimately, everything is a global supply chain. We're all interconnected. But again, I don't want to get into the political territory of this other than state the obvious that business likes free trade, tariff-free trade. Sorry, I think there were other questions, so let's go to those."

I'm smiling mildly, and the reason I'm doing that is because we have positions, as you all know, with both Airbus and Boeing. We also have the primary structure on the C Series that Bombardier is producing. So ultimately, we have -- let's say, we have fingers in many pies.  Whether one wins or the other, I'm not going to pronounce myself. I don't think it's up to me to talk about the composite wing of Airbus compared to Boeing. What I would say is that all of those platforms are poised, in our view, for growth. Just yesterday, I was seeing Qantas' announcement that it was going to retire the 747 fleet and replace it by the 787, the Dreamliner. I think the 787 is what you meant on the 797, on the 70 something. It's a wonderful aircraft, I've told it a few times, and really makes a difference. A 10-hour journey feels like a 2-hour European hop, totally, totally different. And I can see the merits of that because the user experience be far better. So Airbus has the same. The Bombardier, I think, is an interesting question. I think the C Series complements the offering ultimately that Airbus does. So the fact that there is this mutual interest, I think, is helpful. I think C Series is stronger with the Airbus connection than without, so to us, it's a positive. I'd say it doesn't have an impact short term. I'd like to think it was different. But I think in a lot of these things, one has to be patient. And everything I've seen, everything I've seen in the last couple of years reaffirms the beliefs that we have, the convictions that we have that the choices we made to get into composites is the right one because I think these are really poised for a, I'd say, slow, steady but very, very attractive growth over time but a lot [ overnighters ]."

We have disclosed what they're worth to us on the web, so you can see what's the magnitude, what's our business on each platform, the 787, et cetera, means to Solvay. But that's also why I think folks understand and have confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time in composites but also appreciate it doesn't happen as quickly as we see, for example, in our Specialty Polymers business. But fundamentally, what I would say is that if you look back over time, go back 10, 20 years, the composites penetration was in the order of 10% to 15%. We're now into the 40%, 50% range. So composites is displacing metal. Composite is displacing even aluminum. So for example, my understanding on Airbus, when the Rusal -- U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced, Rusal was a target. And I know that the main shareholder there is looking to reduce their shares to try and get away from that constraint. That's going to cause problems for people like Airbus and Boeing and others because they're dependent on companies like Rusal to provide their aluminum. But even if they can't get the aluminum, you can't put composites quickly. These are generational changes. But fundamentally, the growth has gone from 10%, 15%, 40%, 50%. I'm not suggesting it could go to 70%, 80%, 90%, I don't know. But even at 50% plus for the next 10, 15 years is excellent business, excellent, excellent business."

So to my mind, I look at a few things. I look at its growth potential. I look at its cash generation. I look at its returns and our aroma performance business, which is vanillin, ticks all 3 boxes. And I don't see anything that changes that for now. One can always find good reasons to sell businesses, and it's not difficult to do that. But what I would say is that after 50 M&A deals in 4 years, we've got a portfolio that we think is coherent, balanced, has the right critical mass and will grow value. So I don't think that -- I don't see merit in further M&A. I wouldn't say never is never, but it's not the agenda for now. The real agenda's growth. I think [ if I look at ] aroma performance, they'll be net contributors to our growth aspirations as well. Again, remember, it's a leadership -- has leadership positions in vanillin, I think from memory, 50-plus percent of the market, just very, very strong player.
Maybe time for one more question if you have any.  Okay. Well, if there aren't any further questions, thank you for making time this morning. Clearly, if you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to go to Caroline. My hope is that the main takeaways that I've tried to convey to you are clear. Essentially, as expected, steady volume driven growth but not enough to defy gravity, by which, I mean foreign exchange. What's also pleasing for me at least is we've reconfirmed our outlook on profit growth and cash, and we're not standing still. The transformation continues with the organizational announcements that we have announced.
And with that, I bid you a very good day, a safe day and an enjoyable one as well. Thank you."

But fundamentally, what I w",613,"[Audio Gap]
giving you the overview of our Q1 results. And obviously, the main point of today is to take your questions.
Fundamentally, we've delivered strong volume growth. We are growing our businesses, and I'll come to it. But fundamentally, what I would say is despite the fact we moved our sales up 6%, our EBITDA 9% on a like-for-like and an organic basis. So we can't defy gravity. So foreign exchange have taken that plus 9% EBITDA down to minus 3%. Not a surprise. We flagged that at the end of February, but that is a key feature that you would have taken note of.
If I look at the volume growth and where is it coming from, to me, in many ways, it talks about the fact that the transformation that we've been working on for the past few years is beginning to bear fruit. I say that because I see very strong volume growth in specialty polymers and composites that have driven a 9% organic EBITDA growth in the Advanced Materials segment.
What's also really worth noting is that this is addressing the lightweighting, the sustainable mobility solutions and the contribution we're making to that space. We are leaders there. In terms of aerospace, in terms of aeronautics composites, the F-35, the Boeing 787, the 737 platform.
If I look at high-performance polymers, it's really broad based. Automotive is propelling us forward as well. So Advanced Materials, a big tick, a lot of good progress.
Advanced Formulations actually had an even stronger quarter with double-digit organic EBITDA growth, pretty broad based as well, quite diversified markets that we serve. I'd say the volume growth was led by oil and gas in the Novecare business. We also saw the technology solutions generate strong growth in phosphorus and polymer additives. So that's really what's moved us forward.
Performance Chemicals, we knew was going to be going through a bit of a transition with the new capacity that's now onstream but is performing very much in a solid way in a market that still is quite supportive. Any margin erosion is being contained, and fundamentally, it's delivering as we anticipated.
That performance in the first 100 days of the year has given us the confidence to reconfirm the outlook that we gave. To remind you, that outlook indicates growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis. I can't predict what exchanges are going to do. And we also said is no matter what happens to our EBITDA, we will deliver a stronger free cash flow from our continuing businesses.
Final point to note is we'll recognize that the portfolio transformation of Solvay is largely behind us, but there is a new transformation that really was announced and has to do with the realignment of our functions to make us a lot more agile and as to adapt to our business portfolio and really adapt to where we do business with our evolving customers.
We made an announcement on the 29th of March about the organizational update. What you see today is the fact that to enable us to make it happen, we made a provision of EUR 134 million. That will be payable and spent, if you like, over the next 3 years. What's really important is, at the end of those 3 years, our profitability as a consequence of that will be minimum of EUR 150 million higher to the cost reduction. But that's not really the driver. The real driver is to enable us to underpin superior growth -- organic growth. And that's really why we're doing to this.
With that, I'll take your questions. Who'd like to go first?"

I really appreciated Roger. But to my mind, I salute and commend the fact that he's making these choices. I think many of us do in Solvay as well. The extensions are really bringing some more diverse experiences. We've got Cécile de Marsac, adds a bit of gender diversity, and it's interesting because adds a bit of a feminine touch on some of the questions we ask ourselves. And I really like that. It's a different challenge. We got 2 business, real industrial operators, Augusto Di Donfrancesco that was running the Specialty Polymers business. And if I can think of a turbo charger, Augusto being much close to that, very, very business driven, bottom line driven, very, very -- has diversity in a way, complementarity to the existing profiles. And you got Hua Du, who's Chinese, was Asia based, very, very close and a different way to look at the business. So Hua Du, for example, is going to be primarily looking at beyond the supervision responsibilities he's got. He'll be looking at enabling us to grow even better in the Asian markets. And I think, again, we're asking ourselves slightly different questions as a result of that. So I'd say is we're not standing still. We're not dependent on any one individual be it Roger, Jean-Pierre or anybody else. This is a very broad based, deep -- the deep bench, and we're moving. Does that help?"

But the suppressions are really happening in the corporate and the shared service functions. The idea really is to put as many of our functional resources, our experts in the global business units directly much closer to the front line, have a much lighter corporate touch.

Innovations, excellence are 2 examples of that, where we are going to leverage on that much more clearly. So essentially, what it means is a leaner corporate but much more focused on the things that matter the most to the bottom line. We're not going to try and be perfect and excellent at every single thing. We're going to be more pragmatic. I like the term 80-20.

Q1 last year had an average dollar-euro exchange rate to $1.065. This year, it's $1.229. Let's say $1.23. So we essentially have a nearly just over $0.16 difference. That alone -- if you just look at the mechanistic impact, that alone in Q1 is about EUR 30 million. Now there's more to it than dollar. That's one that's weighed the most in our results in Q1. I've got the impact of the Chinese RMB, the Brazilian reais. Even the [ sad real ] with our peroxides plant, all of that has conspired against and essentially contributed another EUR 10 million or so to our negative impact in Q1. That's the first point to make. If I look at the evolution of exchange rates last year, Q2, the average dollar-euro exchange rate was $1.10. Q3, Q4 was $1.17. We averaged the year at $1.13. We started the year at $1.25, and we gave an indication as to the foreign exchange for the full year of EUR 125 million. That's what we said in the February. At the moment, I'm not going to celebrate the fact that the dollar-euro is at $1.20 because, you know what, these things have a habit of turning very, very fast. If we look at various economic expectations from banks and others, they're still in the $1.25 range. Certainly, one has to be cautious. I'm not in a position to say the world has moved sufficiently for me to vary from the guidance I gave at the beginning of the year. What I would say is the comps Q2 will be somewhat narrower than Q1 and similarly for Q3, Q4 as well if exchange rates remain as they are. So I don't think I can predict exchange rates beyond this other than say to you we're anticipating a certain set of conditions. What I tried to do is not to try and predict absolute results. That's why we're going for this organic growth because we will control what we can control, sales, cost, cash, and we will demonstrate what was impact -- we will illustrate the impacts of evolution of exchange rates, which is what we've done.

What it essentially means, and this is something we probably have more exposure than others, because we have a much more substantial U.S. business compared to our past and compared to many of our peers, particularly with the acquisition of Cytec over 2 years ago, that means our U.S. profits are worth less in euros than previously. That is essentially what we're talking about as a prime example. If I said it differently, $100 million of profits last year would have been worth roughly EUR 92 million. This year, it will be worth a lot less than -- I can't do math arithmetically, but we're taking EUR 80-something million, so -- and is purely mechanistic. It's just the maths. Equity investors understand though. This is part of the value proposition for their investments. But the key point to note in all of this is to go beyond the, call it, gravity, not foreign exchange rate I can't control or predict and focus on the fact that the machine is delivering. There is strong volume growth. It's not new news. Obviously, this has been happening now for the last quite a few quarters, 6 quarters sequentially from memory.

It's conceivable that if the Chinese put into effect the retaliation, the U.S. confirm, et cetera, yes, it would a have a bit of a dent. I'd say it's not going to be hugely material on our business, but it will have an impact, yes. Our first reaction will be to try to mitigate through pricing, et cetera, but let's see. But to answer your point, no, it doesn't keep me awake because it's relatively modest. I'd say these are part of the knocks in business we have to adapt. So it'll have an impact but not huge ultimately. But once we see those things being confirmed, if they happen, then, clearly, if there's any significant impact on our short-term expectations, we'll advise the market in due course. But there's not one for now for me. But I would say it's not about being complacent. We are vigilant. I've got the list of the hundred-plus [ industrial ] products. We know where we could be impacted. We looked at our supply chain. So I  like to be prepared for those eventualities. We talk about trade, but the same applies to sanctions on Russia for example. We heard the news about Rusal. Rusal is a customer of Solvay. Again, not huge but every little bit can count. So we're there to meet our customers' needs provided we can do so legally. So again, if sanctions environment change, then these -- we can escape some of these effects. But again, none of that at this point is material to us. The real point is we're in an environment which has more geopolitical uncertainty perhaps than we've seen in the past. What I am reassured by, and that's why I say pleasingly, is that we have a very diversified portfolio. It takes a lot to knock holes into our performance. It really takes a lot. So I'm not sitting here losing sleep. Long answer to an important short question, I hope it helps. And maybe one final thing. At the risk of stating the obvious, we don't like protectionism. We think business, value, economies are best served without protectionist measures because, ultimately, everything is a global supply chain. We're all interconnected. But again, I don't want to get into the political territory of this other than state the obvious that business likes free trade, tariff-free trade. Sorry, I think there were other questions, so let's go to those."

I'm smiling mildly, and the reason I'm doing that is because we have positions, as you all know, with both Airbus and Boeing. We also have the primary structure on the C Series that Bombardier is producing. So ultimately, we have -- let's say, we have fingers in many pies.  Whether one wins or the other, I'm not going to pronounce myself. I don't think it's up to me to talk about the composite wing of Airbus compared to Boeing. What I would say is that all of those platforms are poised, in our view, for growth. Just yesterday, I was seeing Qantas' announcement that it was going to retire the 747 fleet and replace it by the 787, the Dreamliner. I think the 787 is what you meant on the 797, unless I missed something. It's a wonderful aircraft, I've flown it a few times,, and really makes a difference. A 10-hour journey feels like a 2-hour European hop, totally, totally different. And I can see the merits of that because the user experience be far better. So Airbus has the same. The Bombardier, I think, is an interesting question. I think the C Series complements the offering ultimately that Airbus does. So the fact that there is this mutual interest, I think, is helpful. I think C Series is stronger with the Airbus connection than without, so to us, it's a positive. I'd say it doesn't have an impact short term. I'd like to think it was different. But I think in a lot of these things, one has to be patient. And everything I've seen, everything I've seen in the last couple of years reaffirms the beliefs that we have, the convictions that we have that the choices we made to get into composites is the right one because I think these are really poised for a, I'd say, slow, steady but very, very attractive growth over time but they're not overnighters."

We have disclosed what they're worth to us on the web, so you can see what's the magnitude, what's our business on each platform, the 787, et cetera, means to Solvay. But that's also why I think folks understand and have confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time in composites but also appreciate it doesn't happen as quickly as we see, for example, in our Specialty Polymers business. But fundamentally, what I would say is that if you look back over time, go back 10, 20 years, the composites penetration was in the order of 10% to 15%. We're now into the 40%, 50% range. So composites is displacing metal. Composite is displacing even aluminum. So for example, my understanding on Airbus, when the Rusal -- U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced, Rusal was a target. And I know that the main shareholder there is looking to reduce their shares to try and get away from that constraint. That's going to cause problems for people like Airbus and Boeing and others because they're dependent on companies like Rusal to provide their aluminum. But even if they can't get the aluminum, you can't put composites quickly. These are generational changes. But fundamentally, the growth has gone from 10%, 15%, 40%, 50%. I'm not suggesting it could go to 70%, 80%, 90%, I don't know. But even at 50% plus for the next 10, 15 years is excellent business, excellent, excellent business."

But what I would say is that after 50 M&A deals in 4 years, we've got a portfolio that we think is coherent, balanced, has the right critical mass and will grow value. So I don't think that -- I don't see merit in further M&A. I wouldn't say never is never, but it's not the agenda for now. The real agenda's growth. I think [ if I look at ] aroma performance, they'll be net contributors to our growth aspirations as well.

The transformation continues with the organizational announcements that we have announced.

And together, we will provide an overview of our first quarter of 2018 results. Just a few other introductions and then I will turn to Karim.
I would say that this first quarter was very much in line with our expectation. Strong volume growth continued, driven by the Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation clusters. As you know much of our Advanced Materials cluster provides lightweighting solutions to our customers in markets like automotive, aerospace and a few others. We've benefited from the strength in automotive and also the fact that our product gained market share, replacing metals with high-performance polymer in a number of applications. So overall, a very good run in the automotive segment. Aerospace, composite continued in its growth trajectory, both for the military programs and the commercial ones, generating significant volume growth. Formulation performed well too. We are focusing there to serve our customers' needs in terms of resource efficiency. Growth was especially notable in oil and gas. We serve mostly the nonconventional oil and gas markets in North America and we have seen a very strong trends there. The only point of attention during this quarter was -- in this cluster was our mining chemical business, which was flat compared to last year, but in our view it's a temporary situation and we expect a good run for the full year and this segment too.
On an organic basis, our EBITDA grew 9% in the first quarter, very much in line with our midterm objective [ fall ], and this was also unfortunately something expected. The combination of scope, we had a couple of small transaction but which weighed on our EBITDA because we have not restated for these transactions. And especially for an exchange headwinds, reduced EBITDA by 3% to EUR 533 million. In this context, we are able to maintain a strong EBITDA margin of 21%. In an inflationary environment, as far as raw material and energy input are concerned, well this is a good sign that indeed we benefit from significant pricing power in the various markets where we play.
With that, Karim, could you provide us with additional insights in our financial performance and I will come back with some closing remarks regarding the -- how we see the year in front of us."

Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press relea",1401,"Of course. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Before I get into the key aspect of our performance, maybe just highlight the fact that we have been listening and I hope you appreciate the fact that we've tried to distill the key points in a more strategic press release. Well, of course, we supplement that with a comprehensive financial report available on our website. As usual, I will refer to slides that you can access on our website and the figures that I refer to are on an underlying basis, and also reflect the fact that we show the polymer activities as being discontinued. 
Let's start with sales and perhaps, if we can refer to Slide #8. The fact of the matter is net sales have declined 3% in the quarter, but when you exclude the scope and the anticipated foreign exchange impact, sales increased by 6% year-on-year. Volumes were up 5%, driven by strong growth in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. Volumes grew 6% in Advanced Materials, as we continue to benefit from the lightweighting trend, which really raise a sustainable mobility. If we look at our high-performance polymers, especially in automotive, we see a strong demand, fueled by the drive for fuel efficiency, for electrification of vehicles. But we also saw good demand in other markets, including healthcare, food packaging, electronics, to name but a few. On the composite side of our business, sales volumes grew double digit on the back of increased production of commercial aircraft, including, by way of example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the 737 MAX, and would be continued, an anticipated ramp-up of the F-35 military program. We've also seen improved demand in helicopter and in the business jets sectors. These are developments which we really welcome. The industrial side of the business also showed improvements in the quarter, and that's mainly linked to high-performance auto programs.
If I turn to our Special Chem business, we delivered robust demand growth in the electronic sector and that's supported by our recent capacity expansions. And that helped us set a reduction in the demand for rare earth oxides in automotive, linked to the shift away from diesel to gasoline engines. Overall, that resulted in a stable volume for that business. 
Turning to Advanced Formulations. Volumes were up 8%, driven by the need for greater resource efficiency, by which I mean that the solutions we developed helped our customers to optimize the cost, the yield and the environmental impact of the resources that they're working on. That growth was complemented by higher pricing overall. The continued strength of the North American shale oil and gas market did lead to significant growth versus Q1 last year, when we saw the oil and gas market begin its recovery. That strength was further supported by positive product mix with greater use of advanced friction reducers by our customers.
Turning to our Technology Solutions business. We saw strong demand for our phosphine specialties, most notably for the electronics industry, which really propelled us forward. In mining, market conditions are stable, with good demand for metal extractants, but our volumes at the start of the year were flat, mainly related to order patterns. 
Turning to Performance Chemicals. Volumes were stable overall. We saw solid demand in soda ash and derivatives, but our progress was held back by logistical supply chain constraints, which are linked to a lack of railcar availability in the U.S, which meant that our sales were 4% lower, whereas the margins were very much as planned at beginning of the year, as anticipated. Bicarbonate volumes were stable but also benefited from product mix. On the other side of the equation, we saw a very strong growth in our Coatis business, both in terms of pricing and volumes, as both the domestic and the export markets improved for both solvents and phenols.
Back to top line. If I turn to Slide 9 and look at the bottom line on the EBITDA, in the bridge, you see that the strong volumes I refer to contributed strongly to our performance but were insufficient to overcome the adverse impact of Forex in scope. I'll say a few words on foreign exchange, where you see EUR 43 million of negative impact. It won't escape your attention that last year's averaged dollar-euro exchange rate was 1.065. The equivalent for the quarter, Q1 2018, was 1.229. That $0.16 decline alone using the sensitivity that you're very familiar with, accounts for EUR 30 million out of EUR 43 million. There is a basket of other currencies that individually are pretty minor or modest, but collectively adds about EUR 13 million difference or adverse impact, and I'm taking here about the Chinese RNB, Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and even the Saudi Arabian riyal, for example, where we have the peroxide plant. That is part of the headwind that held back our progress. Now if I leave those 2 aspects aside into the scope of foreign exchange, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, our underlying EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, organically. We've managed to maintain positive pricing power in this inflationary environment and that more than offset clearly the raw materials. And that's again due to our ongoing focus on pricing and excellence. In Performance Chemicals, this effect was partly offset by the anticipated pricing environment in the context of new capacity that we anticipated for a while now. 
Operational excellence did have a very significant impact and a very positive impact on the bottom line. And it helped to feed strong demand at our -- some of our saturated plants, de-bottlenecking and increasing yields helping us reduce variable cost. I'd like to give you one example, where with our Specialty Polymers site in Tavaux in France, we managed to achieve de-bottlenecking by the deployment of digital advanced analytics that gave us insights into operating more optimally than before, and that helped to contribute to double-digit increase in our production in the quarter in a market with very, very strong demand. These are the kind of examples that are contributing strongly to our bottom line. As Jean-Pierre said, we've managed to sustain our EBITDA margin at 21%, which, as you know, remains in the top quartile for our sector.
Short word on earnings PS, our earnings per share on a continuing basis was EUR 2 per share, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects a reduction in our financing charges and on our tax rate as well. And you would've noticed that our underlying tax rate was 25% in this quarter, compared to 26% this time last year. Clearly there's more to performance than just profits and EPS. Cash is key. And before I say a few words on cash, you will have noticed that we've now extended our normal analysis on our free cash flow by extending it for financial charges, and also for minority dividend, minority [ with ] dividend, really trying to target the fact that our free cash for that really matters to many of you as the cash flow available to fund our own dividend to our own shareholders. I hope that is a welcome development. It's not new information; it's always been disclosed. We've just taken 1 or 2 steps to make it even easier for you to understand our performance. 
Turning to our performance. We are remaining totally focused on free cash. It actually is critical. Our free cash flow was 108 -- EUR 105 million from our continuing businesses. And it was lower than last year, and that really reflects working capital bills and phasing from 1 quarter to the next. Our CapEx discipline is there, very much there. We're, I think, EUR 2 million lower than last year, totally in line with our expectations. And maybe just worth noting that 2, 3 years ago, you will have seen historically Solvay's net debt increased in the first quarter. Last year we were flat, this year we're flat. In other words, the free cash flow we generate to our Solvay shareholders was adequate to pay for the dividend, interim dividend that we pay in Q1 as well. As a result, our net debt is stable at EUR 5.3 billion, and that includes EUR 2.2 billion of the perpetual hybrid bonds. Clearly we will continue to focus on our cash and fully expect to deliver the free cash flow from continuing operations. And with that, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

But first I want to underline that we have announced, at the end of March, our transformation plan. We have a very simple objective, make sure that we are getting all of Solvay's organization focused on delivering our solutions to our customers, and we are achieving that for a significant simplification of our organization and key processes. For me, it was an absolute necessity of Solvay, very significant confirmation of the portfolio to make sure that we can benefit indeed from the very strong portfolio that we've built over time. 
So we've promised that we would give you a -- we'd issue a result on some guidance on what this will represent. We expect this transformation in organization to generate a recurrent annual EBITDA contribution of EUR 150 million. We think it will take us 3 years to achieve that. Half of these gains are on headcount reductions and the other 50% are lean proficiency improvements. We have booked, with this quarter result, a onetime restructuring cost of EUR 134 million to account for the restructuring cost of this organizational transformation. And clearly, for us, the key objective of this improvement is to strengthen our ability to deliver continued growth. We've been quite successful in past years to create an outstanding customer experience for our limited number of our customers. What we want to do is to make sure that, across-the-board, know that customers that we serve throughout our various cluster, we have visibility of a differentiated customer experience. 
Turning to the outlook for the rest of 2018, maybe just on a personal note, you will know that I will transition out of my current responsibility by the end of the year. I can just tell you that the board is very much on track as far as the succession process is concerned. We are currently reviewing candidates, both external and internal, with the objective to have completed the transition process by the end of 2018. And I can tell you that in the meantime, I stay fully committed to make sure that we deliver on the various priorities that we have for 2018, which means that myself and my colleagues from the [indiscernible] are indeed focused on driving growth in 2018. And we can only confirm our previous guidance of growing full year organically -- growing our EBITDA, I should say, organically by between 5% and 7%. By the way, we started with 9% organic growth in the first quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to weighs on the results in the second quarter. But -- and it's very important that you realize that leaving aside the foreign exchange, organic growth is likely to be weighed towards the second half of 2018. And with that, we are now with Karim in a position to take your questions."

And the trend going forward on that, obviously, because a recovery in composites is something you're pointing out some point this year. And then in Advanced Formulations, again, using my numbers anyway, I get the ex oil and gas business down sharply on margin. And I'm trying to wonder how much that might be the raw material squeeze, although you said you have positive year-on-year pricing power, I think, and how much potentially is the drag on the Ag side, and I know guar gum is quite important in that businesses as well. And then tied with that, I guess, the guar on the oil and gas, whether we're actually seeing this coming through as expected on a gentle recovery path."

I mean, the project like the F-35 or some of the ramp-up of the single-aisle large commercial F plane is indeed generating this increase in volumes. Karim mentioned also that other markets like helicopter are going well. Regarding the price impact, prices are pretty stable in local currency in this business, but obviously, as you can imagine, a significant part of this business is U.S. dollar driven. But overall again, the good news as we enter into 2018 is the fact that we have very good volume behavior. And obviously, the foreign exchange impact that I was mentioning, it was transactional impact on prices.
Advanced Formulation, I think the market, which is going very well, is, as you can imagine, the oil and gas in North America where we see indeed a very strong dynamic, mostly driven by friction reducers. While we see people showing more interest, but it's too early to mention big return of guar base formulation in this segment. I mentioned that the Technology Solutions business, especially mining, was a bit soft during the quarter, but Forex is more phasing, a subject that we should clearly worry about. On the non oil and gas businesses at Novecare, frankly speaking, not much to comment. We've seen, as usual, a mix of pluses and minuses there, but no specific plan. I think the -- I think in Novecare, we're probably at a point of stem where our focus should be on margin, and yes, we expect to be able to benefit from a very dynamic market in some of our segment to be able to improve our margins. I hope I covered most of your questions."

Normally, that is related with onetime cost with a factor of 1 to 2, which would normally mean EUR 150 million to EUR 300 million onetime cost. You booked EUR 134 million in Q1. Is it fair to say that additional restructuring costs will be booked in the course of 2018 and eventually in 2019? And if so, can you provide more insights on what is your best guess about the final restructuring costs? And also your best guess about the related cash-outs in total for 2018? You expect some EUR 18 million cash-outs from that restructuring, but certainly that's not the final figure. And related to that, regarding the savings, I would like to know what is your guess about the retention rate, so I mean how much can you keep and how much you have to share with your customers? The second question is on, especially for Karim, on free cash flow from continuing operations. And in your quarterly report, you show that this figure drops by 37% year-over-year from EUR 168 million to EUR 105 million. In your presentation, on Slide 11, you show the free cash flow from continuing operations and attributable to shareholders was basically flat, from EUR 102 million to EUR 99 million. I would like to understand the delta in the last year's figure between this EUR 168 million and the EUR 102 million."

Martin, on the organizational impact, EUR 150 million, maybe just to give you a bit of more clarity, more insight to, 50% of that is to do with role suppression, call it, headcount reduction over time, and the other 50% from really deploying different discipline and much more surgical, targeted approach around site purchasing and various elements of that nature. So if I go back to a broad ballpark benchmark and I expect 1 to 2x, if you take half of EUR 150 million and say 75% -- EUR 75 million is going to be role suppression related, a provision of EUR 130-odd million compared to that is very much within what I think is a reasonable ballpark benchmark that you use. So no surprise there. Perhaps maybe that extra clarity gives you that confidence. What I would say as well though is that we expect -- we still had anticipated a certain element of that in our guidance this year before we gave the guidance beginning of the year. So you don't -- you shouldn't expect anything significant in terms of cash or profits a result of our announcements. More generally speaking, the provision we made is noncash at this stage, as you'd expect. I fully expect that the cash-out in any restructuring cost will be matched by the incremental cash savings. So it's going to be broadly cash neutral in all material terms. That is our expectation. And at the end of this, we expect EUR 150 million to be generated and released into the profitability.
To your other point, on free cash flow, EUR 168 million contrasting with EUR 105 million, the simplest answer is this: When you have EUR 4.5 billion of gross working capital, a shift of EUR 20 million, EUR 30 million, EUR 50 million, EUR 70 million from one month to another is not at all exceptional, very much within the realms of expectations. So if you have high sales in February, slightly softer in March last year and reverse this year, that can have a pretty big impact. When you're selling at nearly EUR 800 million in any one month, it can really boost that. So I'd say it's purely phasing, which is what we've said. And if I look at the underline metric and the focus on cash and its working capital discipline, I look at day sales outstanding, it's that. I look at overdues. It's very much in the green zone, so I'd say the discipline of we generating and delivering rough news is continuing. So the short answer to your question is that, maybe assigning more color to that is less EBITDA has been offset by certainly less cash tax payments, and it really is working capital, that really is the thing, and that clearly is timing. But as Jean-Pierre said, we've reaffirmed our cash guidance and that tells you how confident we are. And you know we did it within every time we've said it. Hope that helps."

And I think that, to my mind, says it's grown but that's not at all part of our overdues or anything we announced. It's purely the timing of the sales. I welcome that. We certainly have the ability to withstand and finance that kind of very modest-looking capital build. As I said, I fully expect Q2 to be equally strong, et cetera. So not at all a point of alarm.

We just have situation where we export from the U.S. mostly to other regions of the world, and we've seen the impact of the -- this is the impact of this phenomena. On composite, yes, we've seen some pressure on raw material and energy cost. You've mentioned epoxy resin, but something, which was easily offset by price increases or who we -- we tend to have long-term pricing in composite, but the trajectory of this pricing evolution was favorable and we continue to focus very much on excellence initiatives in composites. By the way, this is not the end of the game and I still see a number of opportunities for us to continue to increase our excellence initiatives within the composite material to make sure that we generate further upsides in our results. So that's an area where we continue to make reform, but it's a business where we've been able to offset without any specific difficulties or material increase you're mentioning.
Is there any more questions?"

But fundamentally, what I w",613,"[Audio Gap]
giving you the overview of our Q1 results. And obviously, the main point of today is to take your questions.
Fundamentally, we've delivered strong volume growth. We are growing our businesses, and I'll come to it. But fundamentally, what I would say is despite the fact we moved our sales up 6%, our EBITDA 9% on a like-for-like and an organic basis. So we can't defy gravity. So foreign exchange have taken that plus 9% EBITDA down to minus 3%. Not a surprise. We flagged that at the end of February, but that is a key feature that you would have taken note of.
If I look at the volume growth and where is it coming from, to me, in many ways, it talks about the fact that the transformation that we've been working on for the past few years is beginning to bear fruit. I say that because I see very strong volume growth in specialty polymers and composites that have driven a 9% organic EBITDA growth in the Advanced Materials segment.
What's also really worth noting is that this is addressing the lightweighting, the sustainable mobility solutions and the contribution we're making to that space. We are leaders there. In terms of aerospace, in terms of aeronautics composites, the F-35, the Boeing 787, the 737 platform.
If I look at high-performance polymers, it's really broad based. Automotive is propelling us forward as well. So Advanced Materials, a big tick, a lot of good progress.
Advanced Formulations actually had an even stronger quarter with double-digit organic EBITDA growth, pretty broad based as well, quite diversified markets that we serve. I'd say the volume growth was led by oil and gas in the Novecare business. We also saw the technology solutions generate strong growth in phosphorus and polymer additives. So that's really what's moved us forward.
Performance Chemicals, we knew was going to be going through a bit of a transition with the new capacity that's now onstream but is performing very much in a solid way in a market that still is quite supportive. Any margin erosion is being contained, and fundamentally, it's delivering as we anticipated.
That performance in the first 100 days of the year has given us the confidence to reconfirm the outlook that we gave. To remind you, that outlook indicates growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis. I can't predict what exchanges are going to do. And we also said is no matter what happens to our EBITDA, we will deliver a stronger free cash flow from our continuing businesses.
Final point to note is we'll recognize that the portfolio transformation of Solvay is largely behind us, but there is a new transformation that really was announced and has to do with the realignment of our functions to make us a lot more agile and as to adapt to our business portfolio and really adapt to where we do business with our evolving customers.
We made an announcement on the 29th of March about the organizational update. What you see today is the fact that to enable us to make it happen, we made a provision of EUR 134 million. That will be payable and spent, if you like, over the next 3 years. What's really important is, at the end of those 3 years, our profitability as a consequence of that will be minimum of EUR 150 million higher to the cost reduction. But that's not really the driver. The real driver is to enable us to underpin superior growth -- organic growth. And that's really why we're doing to this.
With that, I'll take your questions. Who'd like to go first?"

I really appreciated Roger. But to my mind, I salute and commend the fact that he's making these choices. I think many of us do in Solvay as well. The extensions are really bringing some more diverse experiences. We've got Cécile de Marsac, adds a bit of gender diversity, and it's interesting because adds a bit of a feminine touch on some of the questions we ask ourselves. And I really like that. It's a different challenge. We got 2 business, real industrial operators, Augusto Di Donfrancesco that was running the Specialty Polymers business. And if I can think of a turbo charger, Augusto being much close to that, very, very business driven, bottom line driven, very, very -- has diversity in a way, complementarity to the existing profiles. And you got Hua Du, who's Chinese, was Asia based, very, very close and a different way to look at the business. So Hua Du, for example, is going to be primarily looking at beyond the supervision responsibilities he's got. He'll be looking at enabling us to grow even better in the Asian markets. And I think, again, we're asking ourselves slightly different questions as a result of that. So I'd say is we're not standing still. We're not dependent on any one individual be it Roger, Jean-Pierre or anybody else. This is a very broad based, deep -- the deep bench, and we're moving. Does that help?"

But the suppressions are really happening in the corporate and the shared service functions. The idea really is to put as many of our functional resources, our experts in the global business units directly much closer to the front line, have a much lighter corporate touch. Anything we do from a corporate point of view has got to be very, very much and is very much defined by is it a critical part of our governance policy standard setting or about offering an expertise that has to be shared and is a source of competitive advantage. Innovations, excellence are 2 examples of that, where we are going to leverage on that much more clearly. So essentially, what it means is a leaner corporate but much more focused on the things that matter the most to the bottom line. We're not going to try and be perfect and excellent at every single thing. We're going to be more pragmatic. I like the term 80-20.

Q1 last year had an average dollar-euro exchange rate to $1.065. This year, it's $1.229. Let's say $1.23. So we essentially have a nearly just over $0.16 difference. That alone -- if you just look at the mechanistic impact, that alone in Q1 is about EUR 30 million. Now there's more to it than dollar. That's one that's weighed the most in our results in Q1. I've got the impact of the Chinese RMB, the Brazilian reais. Even the [ sad real ] with our peroxides plant, all of that has conspired against and essentially contributed another EUR 10 million or so to our negative impact in Q1. That's the first point to make. If I look at the evolution of exchange rates last year, Q2, the average dollar-euro exchange rate was $1.10. Q3, Q4 was $1.17. We averaged the year at $1.13. We started the year at $1.25, and we gave an indication as to the foreign exchange for the full year of EUR 125 million. That's what we said in the February. At the moment, I'm not going to celebrate the fact that the dollar-euro is at $1.20 because, you know what, these things have a habit of turning very, very fast. If we look at various economic expectations from banks and others, they're still in the $1.25 range. Certainly, one has to be cautious. I'm not in a position to say the world has moved sufficiently for me to vary from the guidance I gave at the beginning of the year. What I would say is the comps Q2 will be somewhat narrower than Q1 and similarly for Q3, Q4 as well if exchange rates remain as they are. So I don't think I can predict exchange rates beyond this other than say to you we're anticipating a certain set of conditions. What I tried to do is not to try and predict absolute results. That's why we're going for this organic growth because we will control what we can control, sales, cost, cash, and we will demonstrate what was impact -- we will illustrate the impacts of evolution of exchange rates, which is what we've done.

It impacts revenues but also impacts favorably to a point some of our costs net-net and does impact our EBITDA, absolutely. What it essentially means, and this is something we probably have more exposure than others, because we have a much more substantial U.S. business compared to our past and compared to many of our peers, particularly with the acquisition of Cytec over 2 years ago, that means our U.S. profits are worth less in euros than previously. That is essentially what we're talking about as a prime example. If I said it differently, $100 million of profits last year would have been worth roughly EUR 92 million. This year, it will be worth a lot less than -- I can't do math arithmetically, but we're taking EUR 80-something million, so -- and is purely mechanistic. It's just the maths. Equity investors understand though. This is part of the value proposition for their investments. But the key point to note in all of this is to go beyond the, call it, gravity, not foreign exchange rate I can't control or predict and focus on the fact that the machine is delivering. There is strong volume growth. It's not new news. Obviously, this has been happening now for the last quite a few quarters, 6 quarters sequentially from memory.

I'd say it's not going to be hugely material on our business, but it will have an impact, yes. Our first reaction will be to try to mitigate through pricing, et cetera, but let's see. But to answer your point, no, it doesn't keep me awake because it's relatively modest. I'd say these are part of the knocks in business we have to adapt. So it'll have an impact but not huge ultimately. But once we see those things being confirmed, if they happen, then, clearly, if there's any significant impact on our short-term expectations, we'll advise the market in due course. But there's not one for now for me. But I would say it's not about being complacent. We are vigilant. I've got the list of the hundred-plus [ industrial ] products. We know where we could be impacted. We looked at our supply chain. So I  like to be prepared for those eventualities. We talk about trade, but the same applies to sanctions on Russia for example. We heard the news about Rusal. Rusal is a customer of Solvay. Again, not huge but every little bit can count. So we're there to meet our customers' needs provided we can do so legally. So again, if sanctions environment change, then these -- we can escape some of these effects. But again, none of that at this point is material to us. The real point is we're in an environment which has more geopolitical uncertainty perhaps than we've seen in the past. What I am reassured by, and that's why I say pleasingly, is that we have a very diversified portfolio. It takes a lot to knock holes into our performance. It really takes a lot. So I'm not sitting here losing sleep. Long answer to an important short question, I hope it helps. And maybe one final thing. At the risk of stating the obvious, we don't like protectionism. We think business, value, economies are best served without protectionist measures because, ultimately, everything is a global supply chain. We're all interconnected. But again, I don't want to get into the political territory of this other than state the obvious that business likes free trade, tariff-free trade.

I'm smiling mildly, and the reason I'm doing that is because we have positions, as you all know, with both Airbus and Boeing. We also have the primary structure on the C Series that Bombardier is producing. So ultimately, we have -- let's say, we have fingers in many pies.  Whether one wins or the other, I'm not going to pronounce myself. I don't think it's up to me to talk about the composite wing of Airbus compared to Boeing. What I would say is that all of those platforms are poised, in our view, for growth. Just yesterday, I was seeing Qantas' announcement that it was going to retire the 747 fleet and replace it by the 787, the Dreamliner. I think the 787 is what you meant on the 797, unless I missed something. It's a wonderful aircraft, I've flown it a few times,, and really makes a difference. A 10-hour journey feels like a 2-hour European hop, totally, totally different. And I can see the merits of that because the user experience be far better. So Airbus has the same. The Bombardier, I think, is an interesting question. I think the C Series complements the offering ultimately that Airbus does. So the fact that there is this mutual interest, I think, is helpful. I think C Series is stronger with the Airbus connection than without, so to us, it's a positive. I'd say it doesn't have an impact short term. I'd like to think it was different. But I think in a lot of these things, one has to be patient. And everything I've seen, everything I've seen in the last couple of years reaffirms the beliefs that we have, the convictions that we have that the choices we made to get into composites is the right one because I think these are really poised for a, I'd say, slow, steady but very, very attractive growth over time but they're not overnighters."

We have disclosed what they're worth to us on the web, so you can see what's the magnitude, what's our business on each platform, the 787, et cetera, means to Solvay. But that's also why I think folks understand and have confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time in composites but also appreciate it doesn't happen as quickly as we see, for example, in our Specialty Polymers business. But fundamentally, what I would say is that if you look back over time, go back 10, 20 years, the composites penetration was in the order of 10% to 15%. We're now into the 40%, 50% range. So composites is displacing metal. Composite is displacing even aluminum. So for example, my understanding on Airbus, when the Rusal -- U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced, Rusal was a target. And I know that the main shareholder there is looking to reduce their shares to try and get away from that constraint. That's going to cause problems for people like Airbus and Boeing and others because they're dependent on companies like Rusal to provide their aluminum. But even if they can't get the aluminum, you can't put composites quickly. These are generational changes. But fundamentally, the growth has gone from 10%, 15%, 40%, 50%. I'm not suggesting it could go to 70%, 80%, 90%, I don't know. But even at 50% plus for the next 10, 15 years is excellent business, excellent, excellent business."

And I don't see anything that changes that for now. One can always find good reasons to sell businesses, and it's not difficult to do that. But what I would say is that after 50 M&A deals in 4 years, we've got a portfolio that we think is coherent, balanced, has the right critical mass and will grow value. So I don't think that -- I don't see merit in further M&A. I wouldn't say never is never, but it's not the agenda for now. The real agenda's growth. I think [ if I look at ] aroma performance, they'll be net contributors to our growth aspirations as well.

Clearly, if you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to go to Caroline. My hope is that the main takeaways that I've tried to convey to you are clear. Essentially, as expected, steady volume driven growth but not enough to defy gravity, by which, I mean foreign exchange. What's also pleasing for me at least is we've reconfirmed our outlook on profit growth and cash, and we're not standing still. The transformation continues with the organizational announcements that we have announced.
And with that, I bid you a very good day, a safe day and an enjoyable one as well. Thank you."

I'm here in Brussels with our CFO, Karim, and our new head of IR, Joe further. I would like to share, as usual, some introductory comments and then we'll -- Karim will take over to drive you into more details and guide you into more details of our results. 
My first comment is that we are presenting half-year results we think that it makes any sense in the business like ours to focus which is a bit of a longer-term approach. So you have all the information related the quarter and we'll certainly be delighted to answer your questions, giving you specific quarterly analysis or quarterly trend business history. But again, I think it makes real sense to focus more on what we've been able to achieve in the half-year. So clearly, I think that the headline is pretty simple. We have been able to generate strong growth in businesses, which are in our key growth areas, which help us and compensate for the still significant negative foreign-exchange impact. 
Organic net sales grew 6% driven by strong volume growth in advanced formulation and advanced material. Organic EBITDA growth was 6%, in line with our expectation. 
If you take into account foreign exchange conversion, underlying EBITDA was down 3% mainly related to the euro dollar exchange rate. Some comments on the market. 
First one is a strong demand growth in the oil and gas market, which reported both double-digit top line and bottom line organic growth in advanced formulation. We've seen, thanks to the strong demand, we've seen both an impact on volume but also on prices, but overall, the and advanced formulation crystal was indeed, very strong. System grew demand for high performance continued across several application in particular the automatic market where we have been both on the dynamic of the market but also from the fact that our technology fits very we related trend and we see us gaining share is also development of electric vehicles of who we use about newer technologies, instead of a traditional one . Study broad based growth continues in composite international aircraft, military and returning strand in business jet and helicopter. 
In fact, we're in some last week we with our teams, and we are very encouraged to see both the dynamic of industry, but also our ability to sign long-term commitment with some of our key customers including Saffron, Air Bursts and spirit we can always producing structure. 
Overall, very positive environment as far as the level of demand is concerned and we're feeling that in fact this market turns as we expected as a long-term growth market. 
May be also, a comment on our platform and chemical business, because I think we are coming out with a key answer on also that is able to resist upon the increasing capacity in Europe. 
We are registering very well line of context, which is pretty favorable and my expectation is that from where we landed today, we'll see from that opportunities to return to a situation where we grow our profitability in this business. 
Looking at the pricing, you see that we've been able to present slightly positive, I would say probably almost neutral pricing power which is good. 
It shows that indeed, we are able to maintain our margins at pretty level in an environment where we continue to see some raw material and energy inflation. And this leave us to a margin very strong at record 23% which puts us very well within the group of European headquarter, diversified chemical company. 
With that, I would turn to Karim to ask him to give us a bit more flavor on this financial results. Karim?"
377837,575640448,1514418,"Solvay SA, H1 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website.

As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. 
As you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on the basis that also reflects the discontinuation of the polyamide activities. Our pickup where Jean-Pierre is talking about, in terms of the market dynamics and we are looking at our sales. We get Slide #8. You see the fact is that sales are up 6% on an organic basis and volumes and mix represented about 5% of that. 
A lot of that has come from our growth operating segments. So Advanced formulation sales were up 10% on an organic basis in the first half and that CAGR is driven by stronger momentum in oil and gas, where our technologies truly help our customers maximize yield and efficiencies. 
Other market supported the growth and I'm taking here of mining chemicals, where demand  increased and we're benefiting from some small mine openings. We are confident this is the beginning of quite a few quarters ahead of us of a similar nature. 
But there's more. We've seen growth in coatings and home and personal care, which also delivered growth, albeit at a more moderated level. 
Turning to Advanced Materials. The fact is, sales was up -- were up 4.5% organically in the half, driven by the auto market, where the trends were fuel efficiency electrification are continuing to drive the momentum, and the need for a truly advanced polymer technologies. 
Demands from small devices was substantially below last year and we are expecting that trend to continue into second half and to the third quarter in particular. 
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, composite sales to aeronautics is also growing significantly across a number of the programs where we are present, reflecting the ongoing need for fuel-efficient aircraft, which again, require the use of high-performance composites. 
Now the growth is broad based, we think in commercial and military aircraft, but it's also very pleasing to see business jets and helicopters drive that momentum as well. 
Performance Chemicals, sales are up 4% on an organic basis and we've seen volume growth both in soda ash and in peroxides. Indeed  the robust demand environment in soda ash means that our plants are operating at very high utilization levels. 
So all in all, good topline norganic performance for the first half of the year. That said, when you factor in foreign-exchange impact, underlying sales are down nearly 2%, predominantly because of the U.S. dollar impact. 
What about the EBITDA ? If we turn to Slide #9, what you will see is that organically it grew 6%. Now it reflects all the benefits of the growth in volumes that are referred to previously, but also some pretty positive dynamics across many of our businesses, and that helped to overcome higher energy and raw material cost such as, for example, higher fuel costs in the advanced materials. And that performance was despite what I would consider to be modest headwinds that we saw earlier in the year related, for example, to transport strikes in Brazil, through multiweek shutdown of the Silica plant in China. I would also despite what we had actually indicated there was going to come but EUR 12 million reduction in synergies, that reflected -- that related to medical benefits, personal term and benefits. Again, this was not a surprise, we had flagged it early in the year. But to show that growth despite those factors gives you an indication of the sources of the quality of the growth in our portfolio. That is not enough because when you factor in the foreign-exchange conversion impacts as well as some scope impacts, what you see, as a matter of fact, is that underlying EBITDA, as reported, is down 3% year-on-year. 
If we turn to slide #10, you will see also that our net income from continuing businesses is up 7%, despite the lower EBITDA, despite the adverse foreign-exchange impact. Why is that? Two Reasons. Lower financial charges that reflects 2 things, deleveraging that you've seen us deliver in the last couple of years, but also the optimization of our debt. We've retired some pretty expensive that last year and that's having a very clear impact on our results and our cash. And we also see a reduction in our underlying tax rate from 29% last year to 25% this year. Indeed, the positive developments from the financial charges and tax rates have helped to propel our EPS, earnings per share from continuing businesses by nearly 9% in this half, and that's despite the adverse foreign-exchange impacts. 
So as far as cash is concerned, we remain totally focused on generating strong cash and converting strong profits into cash flow. 
The factors that are free cash flow from continuing businesses of EUR 123 million was down on last year, largely because of a modest build in working capital, which reflects the phasing of our sales growth late in the second quarter. 
The good news as well as that the free cash flow to shareholders increased from EUR 33 million last year to EUR 77 million last year and I remind you, that cash flow measures is after financing costs. 
To the fact that it increased reflects 2 things, lower financial charges, which I have alluded to, and also strong cash flow from our discontinued operations. 
That's 1 final point before I turn back to Jean-Pierre and that is I'll give you an update on simplification plans we announced in the first quarter. The great news is that the dialogue with our social partners has concluded constructively, and we are now moving from planning to execution mode. 
As a result of the improved clarity that follows the conclusion of this social procedures and a modest increase actually and the number of jobs suppressions, we've increased our total provision by EUR 43 million to total of EUR 178 million. 
Those cash restructuring expense this year is unchanged. We expect it to be unchanged at about EUR 30 million this year and that is completely factoring in to our outlook. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

The first one is, again, reassuring outlook regarding performance chemical. After all the questions we at in past quarters, I think it's very good to see that the business is managing very well in current environment and despite the new capacity coming into Europe, we see that our plans there are operating at full capacity and pretty optimistic that the combination of all the business within performance chemical, indeed, perform better than we expected at the beginning of the year. Second important point is about Advanced Formulations. There were some questions in past years about the ability of this business. To grow, I think what we see during this semester, show that there are, indeed, opportunities. It's oil and gas, but not just oil and gas. Most of the segment but not gas serves with the execution of which is pretty flattish, and demonstrated significant opportunities for both volume growth and improved pricing. 
So now if I comment too quickly on the priorities for the remaining of the year, the first one obviously is the completion of the Polyamide sale. You've seen that the European commission not completely surprisingly is asking a number of questions, which leads us to move into the Phase II reports to this antitrust clearance. But together, we are with the BSF we are very aligned and confident in earning the completion of this project. From an operational standpoint, we just confirm our guidance. We expect to generate another underlying EBITDA estimated cost estimated at 5% to 7% for the full year, we've just done 6% for this first half, and will convert that performance into strong free cash flow. And despite the performance, which was little bit on the soft side as well as free cash flow  is concerned, for the reason that Karim has explained, we were very confident that we for the full year will be in line with or exceed our guidance. But again, we are preparing for the future. The key priority is as I mentioned, is really to focus on the simplification of our organization. We want to become much more customer focused. We want to deliver a superior customer experience to our partners and this is why we need lean and very efficient organization. You know also that this year is a year where board is always working on fuel succession . We are still operating within the expected timeframe and I would expect to hand over around your hand. We had an update on this process at the board meeting yesterday and I feel comfortable where this we will be the case and we should probably expect an announcement within the month of October. 
Then last point, you know that we will holding with my colleagues from the Quebec an update for investors in London on September 24. I hope we will see a lot of you there and it will be an opportunity to have direct dialogue and frankly speaking from people who wonder whether it makes sense to have such meeting few months before succession. I can just confirm to you that the board is clearly, very comfortable with the Solvay around strategy and should not expect a new CEO coming to implement a different strategies. I think what we will be able to share with you on September 24 will, indeed, make a lot of sense. And with that, we are ready with Karim to take your questions."

Again, the one exception, which was the eg market which was, what say, pretty soft. For all the other markets we've seen significant opportunities for volume gain and conditions, which help us improve our pricing in the context where as we've commented, for the last few quarters, we have improved opposition as far as access to all materials is concerned. So these are key fact and yes, we've seen a bit more of some of the higher value product being sold, but I would consider that as weaker effect in comparison to volume and prices.

Thomas, on the free cash flow, there are probably 2 key factors I want to highlight. One is the fact that 2017 performance was stronger than in 2016, which meant that the verbal remuneration of bonuses, which are fully provided for in '17 are paid out in second quarter of '18. So what you basically have is a very renumeration that is higher this year than last year, that is one factor to highlight. More importantly, and the majority of the reasons for that cash flow is, as I said before, which is we've built some working capital, we have been very modest, and I'll explain what I mean by that. Our working capital, which in gross terms, if we add up payables, receivables, inventories is EUR 4.5 billion. We're talking of 2% to 3% build because we want to make sure we can be there for our customers with the inventories to meet strong demand dynamics. And when you see strong demand dynamics of growth in May and June, absolutely, we've built some working capital. We don't normally see that in the mid-November to December time frames. 
So at this point in time, things are exactly where we thought they'd be. Obviously we look at or I look at some of the key more operation KPIs overdue. Day Sales outstanding, payables inventory turns. There is no single thing on that dashboard that is making anything other than green. So yes, more work to do, but we've got a good track record and sort of disciplined and focused, absolutely confident we will deliver it, which is why we iterated our guidance. Does that help?"

I think we are seeing some softness there and probably a bit of a decrease in activity, which is leading to a couple of things, our first one is our design choices made by all key customer, which in some cases favors, in other cases don't favor our polymer solutions. And the second are specific production forecast, but at end of the day, we see less of a contribution of smart devices into our results. Overall, I would say it's probably good news. Any business is welcome, but this reduces a bit of dependancy with specific segment and to say the specific customer, it will continue to be very important 1, but the fact of the business continues to grow very well, allowing us to de-risk and have better spread of activities in the Specialty Polymers, spread of exposure I should say Specialty Polymers business. So overall, i think that we are demonstrating our ability during this year to go through this addition of activities in smart devices without major impact on our growth trajectory. 
For CEO succession, I'll be discrete as you would imagine. This is really a process that the board is in charge of. I'm And contributing to the process. I'm aware of where we are, but I guess not at the point where we want to make too many public comments. 
Regarding the profile, we'll need someone who can continue the transformation of the group within the strategy that the board has approved. And the board is very assistant on the fact that they want the strategy to be continued and discussions with potential candidates are based on this assumption. We want to look in details, both at external and internal candidates and it's the reason why the process takes a bit of time. I would say not an extraordinary period of time, if you want to decide and the identification and analysis of external candidate. Major is that we should stay in the framework, that we have announced a few months ago, which means the condition around your hand and I expect, once again, an announcement to be made during the month of October. So this is probably the best update and summary that I can give you."

But in this context, we have been able indeed to manage pricing very well. The reason is simple. We bring some -- we bring performance to our customers and at the end of the day what they want is an overall very competitive and effective setup. So we have been able to see in oil and gas, both volume and price increase. This is really the results of all the thoughts we've done during the past 2 years, where we are facing a very changing market and we took this opportunity both to work on the improvement of the performance of our product and at the same time, make sure we could build a much more effective supply chain in the market where we've seen a number of competitors disappearing. 
So we're pretty pleased with the situation that we're expecting, but it's good when it happens. 
Where we see volume opportunities but also opportunities to make sure we get the right price for our product. 
Peroxide, you're right to mention a number of positive reasons and our Saudi plant is humping up or has ramped up very well and in fact we see a very significant volume sale, that's good. But we see also good news across all the North American situation has normalized for us and we see some of our key customers doing well, which is good. 
Overall pricing in Asia was pretty nice picture on peroxide. And soda ash, I can just reiterate what I was saying. We see overall a good level of demand. Volume for Turkey are there, but they have been observed by this market in a contacts where we've seen a bit of reduction of export volumes coming from China. Yes, our view today is whether price should increase in 2019, but to view we have not started negotiation yet with customers, but we think that the situation we had during this year we are, once again, we've not been able to fully compensate in the end of '17 negotiations. The expected increase in energy cost, we think that this situation is now behind us, and we are more optimistic on our ability to manage this equation better in 2019. Hence our view that things should gradually improve in the Performance Chemicals customer from where we are today."

One is the F45 from Lockheed Martins and the other 1 is really pungent. So this is really something, which will play in the next -- in years to come. Demand on advanced material, it continues to increase, yes, to a bit of a slower pace, and this is mostly lead into what I was commenting regarding the smart device segment.

We're using peronated gases to do that, and we are seeing some challenges in this market, so the turnover explanation. Special Chem has also some core businesses especially the the electronic grade H2O2, but we are in a situation where the development in electronic grade H2O2 don't compensate fully the impact that we are seeing on the insulation market. And may to be absolutely comprehensive, we are also seeing some softness of obvious reason in the diesel catalyst market. Special Chem we serve both diesel and gasoline, but probably more value-added on diesel and the market in Europe is turning quite steeply in the direction of more gasoline engine vehicle. So smart devices on one hand and in Specialty Polymers, and within the special Chem, insulation and diesel to gasoline, these are really the components which explain this slightly softer growth in Advancement Material."

I think that's something where we need to give a bit more visibility to the market, but I would rather wait until we have an opportunity for a bit more detailed discussion, because indeed this is becoming significant for Solvay and also opportunities in this segment are quite impressive. For oil and gas, a lot of people are using rig count as a simple driver for the development of stimulation activities in unconventional oil and gas. This is a bit of a simplistic proxy, because we see more and more situations where people could have different strategy once they've drilled a hole and we see also a situation where as technology evolves, people can demand more and more simulation with just 1 single hole. So not easy to answer your question. What I can mention is that we continue to see, on the ground, very strong level of activities and people willing to increase the production and this calls for more stimulation. So the dynamics there is pretty good, and we expect to continue from that and by the way the latest news on oil prices are probably also pushing for that. But don't get the simple view, but people would drill a hole, the next day, they will do stimulation using our product. Strategies and technologies are becoming much more complex and sophisticated and there is less of link and probably even less of set lag time between the time of the drilling and the actual use of our product."

So good news there in more or less on all fronts. And in a bit to, are also in the current context showing good opportunities, the auto business -- it's a small business but which is doing well. 
Well with that, I would suggest that we bring this call to conclusion. I would like to thank all of you for your participation. Once again, if you can participate in our September 24 update for investors, that will held in London, that would be a great opportunity to get your preview on various fronts and give you a view of where our company is going. And with that, I wish you a very nice summer and I'm looking forward to meet you face-to-face in November call. Thank you very much."

I'm here in Brussels with our CFO, Karim, and our new head of IR, [indiscernible]. I would like to share, as usual, so",650,"Thank you very much, and thanks all of you to be with us on this very busy last day of July to share our half year results presentation. I'm here in Brussels with our CFO, Karim, and our new head of IR, [indiscernible]. I would like to share, as usual, some introductory comments and then we'll -- Karim will take over to drive you into more details or guide you into more details of our results.
[indiscernible] first comment is that we are presenting half year results. We think that it makes any sense in the business like ours to focus on -- which is a bit of a longer-term approach. So you have all the information related to the quarter, and we'll certainly be delighted to answer your question, giving you specific quarterly analysis or quarterly trend is necessary. But again, I think it makes real sense to focus more on what we've been able to achieve in the half year. So clearly, I think the headline is pretty simple. We have been able to generate strong volume growth in businesses, which are in our key growth areas, which help us compensate for the still significantly negative foreign exchange impact.
Organic net sales grew 6% driven by strong volume growth in Advanced Formulations and Advanced Materials. Organic EBITDA growth was 6%, in line with our expectation. If you take into account foreign exchange conversion, underlying EBITDA was down 3% mainly related to the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Some comments on the market. First one is a strong demand growth in the oil and gas market, which reported, both double-digit top line and bottom line organic growth in Advanced Formulations. We've seen -- thanks to the strong demand, we've seen both an impact on volume but also on prices. But overall, the performance of Advanced Formulations cluster was indeed very strong. Consistent growth demand for high-performance polymers continued across several application, in particular the automotive market where we benefit both from the dynamic of the market but also from the fact that our technology fits very well with the latest trend, and we see us gaining share either for the development of electric vehicles or for the use of our newest technologies instead of the traditional one. Steady broad-based growth continues in composite international aircraft, military and returning strand in business jet and helicopter. 
In fact, I was in San [indiscernible] last week with our teams, and we are very encouraged to see both the dynamic of industry, but also our ability to sign long-term commitment with some of our key customers, including Safran, Airbus and Spirit, the company who is producing IO structure. Overall, a very positive environment as far as the level of demand is concerned, and we're feeling that in fact this market turns as we expected as a long-term growth market.
Maybe also a comment on our Performance Chemicals business because I think we are coming now with a key answer on our soda ash. It's able to resist upon the increasing capacity in Europe. We are registering very well line of context, which is pretty favorable and my expectation is that from where we landed today, we'll see from that opportunities to return to a situation where we grow our profitability in this business.
Looking at the pricing, you see that we've been able to present a slightly positive, I would say probably, almost neutral pricing power, which is good. It shows that indeed, we are able to maintain our margins at a pretty reasonable level in an environment where we continue to see some raw material and energy inflation. And this leads to a margin very strong at record 23%, which puts us very well within the group of European-headquartered diversified chemical company.
With that, I will turn to Karim to ask him to give us a bit more flavor on these financial results. Karim?"
377837,575640448,1515107,"Solvay SA, H1 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And as you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on a basis that also reflects the disconti",1036,"Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And as you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on a basis that also reflects the discontinuation of the polyamide activities. Our pickup, well, Jean-Pierre was talking about, in terms of the market dynamics and we are looking at our sales. Let's get Slide #8. You'll see the fact is that sales are up 6% on an organic basis and volumes and mix represented about 5% of that. A lot of that has come from our growth operating segments. So Advanced Formulations' sales were up 10% on an organic basis in the first half and that, clearly, is driven by stronger momentum in oil and gas, where our technologies truly help our customers maximize yield and efficiencies.
Other market supported the growth, and I'm thinking here of mining chemicals, where demand increased, and we're also benefiting from some small mine openings. We're confident this is the beginning of quite a few quarters ahead of us of a similar nature. But there's more. We've seen growth in coatings and home and personal care, which also delivered growth, albeit at a more moderated level.
Turning to Advanced Materials. The fact is sales was up -- were up 4.5% organically in the half, driven by the auto market, where the trends for fuel efficiency electrification are continuing to drive the momentum and the need for a truly advanced polymer technologies. Demand from small devices was substantially below last year, and we're expecting that trend to continue into second half and into the third quarter in particular.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, composite sales to aeronautics is also growing significantly across a number of the programs where we are present, reflecting the ongoing need for fuel-efficient aircraft, which again, require the use of high-performance composites. Now the growth is broad based. We kit in commercial and military aircraft, but it's also really pleasing to see business jets and helicopters drive that momentum as well.
Performance Chemicals, sales are up 4% on an organic basis. And we've seen volume growth, both in soda ash and in peroxides. Indeed the robust demand environment in soda ash means that our plants are operating at very high utilization levels.
So all in all, good top line organic performance for the first half of the year. That said, when you factor in foreign-exchange impact, underlying sales are down nearly 2%, predominantly because of the U.S. dollar impact.
What about the EBITDA? If we turn to Slide #9, what you will see is that organically, it grew 6%. Now it reflects all the benefits of the growth in volumes that are referred to previously, but also some pretty positive dynamics across many of our businesses, and that helped to overcome higher energy and raw material costs such as, for example, higher fuel [indiscernible] costs in Advanced Materials. And that performance was despite what I would consider to be modest headwinds that we saw earlier in the year related, for example, to transport strikes in Brazil to multi-week shutdown of the Silica plant in China. I would also -- despite what we had actually indicated there was going to come but EUR 12 million reduction in synergies that reflected -- that related to medical benefits, post-retirement benefits. Again, this was not a surprise. We had flagged it earlier in the year. But to show that growth despite those factors [indiscernible] gives you an indication of the sources of the quality of the growth in our portfolio. That is not enough because when you factor in the foreign exchange conversion impacts as well as some scope impacts, what you see, as a matter of fact, is that underlying EBITDA, as reported, is down 3% year-on-year.
If you turn to Slide #10, you'll see also that our net income from continuing businesses is up 7% despite the lower EBITDA, despite the adverse foreign exchange impact. Why is that? Two reasons: lower financial charges that reflects 2 things, deleveraging that you've seen us deliver in the last couple of years, but also the optimization of our debt. We've retired some pretty expensive debt last year, and that's having a very clear impact on our results and our cash. And we also see a reduction in our underlying tax rates from 29% last year to 25% this year. Indeed, the positive development from the financing charges and tax rates have helped to propel our EPS, our earnings per share from continuing businesses by nearly 9% in this half, and that's despite the adverse foreign exchange impacts. 
So as far as cash is concerned, we remain totally focused on generating strong cash and converting strong profits into cash flow. The factors that are free cash flow from continuing businesses of EUR 123 million was down in last year, largely because of a modest build in working capital, which reflects the phasing of our sales growth late in the second quarter. The good news as well is that the free cash flow to shareholders increased from EUR 33 million last year to EUR 77 million last year. And I'll remind you that cash flow measures is after financing costs. So the fact that it increased reflects 2 things, lower financial charges, which I have alluded to, and also strong cash flow from our discontinued operations.
There's one final point before I turn back to Jean-Pierre and that is I'll give you an update on the simplification plans we announced in the first quarter. The great news is that the dialogue with our social partners has concluded constructively, and we are now moving from planning to execution mode. As a result of the improved clarity that follows the conclusion of the social procedures and the modest increase actually in the number of job suppressions, we've increased our total provision by EUR 43 million to total of EUR 178 million. Those cash restructuring expense this year is unchanged. We expect it to be unchanged at about EUR 30 million this year, and that is completely factored into our outlook.
And with that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

So maybe just a few comments before opening the Q&A. So I think 2 key takeaways from Karim's presentation. The first one is, again, reassuring our outlook regarding Performance Chemicals.

The first one is, again, reassuring our outlook regarding Performance Chemicals. After all the questions we had in past quarters, I think it's very good to see that the business is managing very well in the current environment. And despite the new capacity coming into Europe, we see that our plants today are operating at full capacity. And I'm pretty optimistic that the combination of all the business within Performance Chemicals will indeed perform better than we expected at the beginning of the year. Second important point is about Advanced Formulations. There were some questions in past years about the ability of this business. To grow, I think what we see during this semester show that there are, indeed, opportunities. It's oil and gas, but not just oil and gas. Most of the segment that north gas serves, with the exception of Agro, which was a pretty flattish, have demonstrated significant opportunities for both volume growth and improved pricing.
So now if I comment too quickly on the priorities for the remaining of the year, the first one, obviously, is the completion of the Polyamide sale. You've seen that the European Commission not completely surprisingly is asking a number of questions, which leads us to move into the Phase II reports to this antitrust clearance. But together, we are with BSF. We are very aligned and confident regarding the completion of this project.
From an operational standpoint, we just confirm our guidance. We expect to generate an underlying EBITDA estimated cost -- estimated at 5% to 7% for the full year. We've just done 6% for this first half. And we will convert that performance into strong free cash flow. And despite the performance, which was a little bit on the soft side as well as free cash flow is concerned for the reason that Karim has explained, we are very confident that for the full year, we'll be in line with or exceed our guidance. But again, we are preparing for the future. The key priority is, as I mentioned, is really to focus on the simplification of our organization. We want to become much more customer focused. We want to deliver a superior customer experience to our partners, and this is why we need to have a lean and very efficient organization.
You know also that this year is a year where the board of Slovay is working on CEO succession. We are still operating within the expected time frame, and I would expect to hand over around your hand. We had an update on this process at the board meeting yesterday, and I feel very comfortable where this will be the case, and we should probably expect an announcement within the month of October.
Then last point, you know that we will all be holding with my colleagues from the Comex an update for investors in London on September 24. I hope we will see a lot of you there, and it will be an opportunity to have a direct dialogue. And frankly speaking, for people who wonder whether it makes sense to have such meeting few months before CEO succession. I can just confirm to you that the board is clearly very comfortable with Solvac around strategy, and you should not expect a new CEO coming to implement different strategies. So I think what we'll be able to share with you on September 24 will indeed make a lot of sense.
And with that, we are ready with Karim to take your questions."

It looks like the first half cash flow -- free cash flow is a touch weaker from continuing operations you had expected. So could you just help me understand the components that are going to either unwind from a nonworking capital perspective in the second half and all the bridge positive factors that give you conviction on that target for free cash flow? That'd be very helpful. And second question, on Advanced Formulations, obviously a very strong performance, very strong price and volume drop through from sales to EBITDA. Is there something in the mix of the business that has changed in this first half that is really allowing that acceleration of profitability? Some further color around that would be very helpful."

Again, with one exception, which is the ag market which was, I would say, pretty soft. For all the other markets, we've seen significant opportunities for volume gain and conditions, which help us improve our pricing in the context where as we've commented for the last few quarters, we have improved opposition as far as access to raw materials is concerned. So these are really the key fact. And yes, we've seen a bit more of some of the higher-value product being sold, but I would consider that as a weaker effect in comparison to volume and prices. Karim, on the free cash flow?"

Thomas, on the free cash flow, there are probably 2 key factors I want to highlight. One is the fact that 2017 performance was stronger than in 2016, which meant that the verbal remuneration of bonuses, which are fully provided for in '17 are paid out in second quarter of '18. So what you basically have is a variable remuneration that is higher this year than last year, that is one factor to highlight. More importantly, and the majority of the reasons for that cash flow is, as I said before, which is we built some working capital. We are very modest, and I'll explain too what I mean by that. Our working capital, which in gross terms, if you add up payables, receivables, inventories is EUR 4.5 billion. We're talking of 2% to 3% build because we want to make sure we can be there for our customers, win the inventories to meet strong demand dynamics. And when you see strong demand dynamics of growth in May and June, absolutely, we've built some working capital. We don't normally see that in the mid-November to December time frames. So at this point in time, things are exactly where we thought they'd be. Obviously we look at or I look at some of the key more operational KPIs overdue, day sales outstanding, same with payables, inventory turns. There is not a single thing on that dashboard that is making anything other than green. So yes, more work to do, but we've got a good track record and sort of discipline and focus. Absolutely confident we will deliver it, which is why reiterated our guidance. Does that help?"

The first one is our design choices made by our key customer, which in some cases favors, in other cases don't favor our polymer solutions. And the second are specific production forecasts. But at end of the day, we see less of a contribution of smart devices into our results. Overall, I would say it's probably good news, I mean, any business is welcome, but this reduces a bit of dependency with specific segment and to say the specific customer. It will continue to be a very important one, but [indiscernible] of the business continues to grow very well, allowing us to derisk and have better spread of activities in the Specialty Polymers, spread of exposure, I should say, in the Specialty Polymers business. So overall, I think that we are demonstrating our ability during this year to go through this addiction of activity in smart devices without major impact on our growth trajectory.
For CEO succession, I'll be discrete as you would imagine. I mean, this is really a process that the board is in charge of. I'm contributing to the process. I'm aware of where we are, but I guess not at the point where we want to make too many public comments. Regarding the profile, yes, we need someone who can continue the transformation of the group within the strategy that the board has approved. And the board has -- is very insistent on the fact that they want the strategy to be continued, and discussions with potential candidates are based on this assumption. We want to look in details, both at external and internal candidates, and it's the reason why the process takes a bit of time. I would say not an extraordinary period of time, if you want to [indiscernible] and in the identification and analysis of external candidate. My view is that we should stay within the framework that we have announced a few months ago, which means a condition around your hand.

But we see also good news across [indiscernible]. The North American situation has normalized for us, and we see some of our key customers doing well, which is good. 
Favorable pricing in Asia, so pretty nice picture on peroxide. And soda ash, I can just reiterate what I was saying. We see an overall good level of demand. Volume for Turkey are there, but they have been absorbed by this market in a context where we've seen a bit of a reduction of export volumes coming from China. Yes, our view today is whether the price should increase in 2019, but to your view, we have not started negotiation yet with customers. But we think that the situation we had during this year where, once again, we've not been able to fully compensate in the end of '17 negotiation. The expected increase in energy costs, we think that this situation is now behind us, and we are more optimistic regarding our ability to manage this equation better in 2019. Hence, our view that things should gradually improve in the Performance Chemicals cluster from where we are today."

And I'll remind you in aerospace that we are benefiting from 2 large programs, large volume program, which are still in a very steep ramp-up phase from pretty low volumes to volumes which would become more and more significant. One is the F45 from Lockheed Martins and the other one is really pungent. So this is really something which will play in the next -- in the years to come. Demand on Advanced Materials, it continues to increase, yes, to bit of a slower pace, and this is mostly leading to what I was commenting regarding the smart device segment. This is the only area where we see challenges, which are mostly linked to design choices, which, in this case, favor a bit less of the use of some of our most sophisticated solutions.

We are using [ ferminated ] gases to do that, and we are obviously seeing some challenges in this market, so the turnover explanation. Special Chem has also some core businesses, especially the electronic grade H2O2, but we are in a situation where the development in electronic grade H2O2 don't compensate fully the impact that we are seeing on the insulation market. And maybe to be absolutely comprehensive, we are also seeing some softness for obvious reason in the diesel catalyst market. I think with Special Chem, we serve both diesel and gasoline, but probably more value-added on diesel, and the market in Europe is turning quite steeply in the direction of more gasoline engine vehicle. So smart devices on one hand in Specialty Polymers, and within Special Chem, insulation and diesel to gasoline, these are really the components which explain this slightly softer growth in Advanced Materials."

I think that's something where we need to give a bit more visibility to the market, but I would rather wait until we have an opportunity for a bit more detailed discussion because, indeed, this is becoming significant for Solvay and also opportunities in this segment are quite impressive. For oil and gas, a lot of people are using rig count as a simple driver for the development of stimulation activities in unconventional oil and gas. This is a bit of the simplistic proxy because we see more and more situations where people could have different strategy once they've drilled a hole, and we see also a situation where, as technology evolves, people can demand more simulation with just 1 single hole. So not easy to answer to your question. What I can mention is that we continue to see on the ground, a very strong level of activities and people willing to increase the production, and this calls for more stimulation. So the dynamic there is pretty good, and we expect to continue to benefit from that. And by the way, the latest news on oil prices are probably also pushing forward. But don't get this simple view that people would drill a hole. The next day, they will do stimulation using our product. Strategies and technologies are becoming much more complex and sophisticated, and there is less of link and probably even less of set lag time between the time of the drilling and the actual use of our product."

I'm here in Brussels with our CFO, Karim, and our new head of IR, [indiscernible]. I would like to share, as usual, some introductory comments and then we'll -- Karim will take over to drive you into more details or guide you into more details of our results.
[indiscernible] first comment is that we are presenting half year results. We think that it makes really sense in the business like ours to focus on -- which is a bit of a longer-term approach. So you have all the information related to the quarter, and we'll certainly be delighted to answer your question, giving you specific quarterly analysis or quarterly trend if necessary. But again, I think it makes real sense to focus more on what we've been able to achieve in the half year. So clearly, I think the headline is pretty simple. We have been able to generate strong volume growth in businesses, which are in our key growth areas, which help us compensate for the still significantly negative foreign exchange impact.
Organic net sales grew 6% driven by strong volume growth in Advanced Formulations and Advanced Materials. Organic EBITDA growth was 6%, in line with our expectation. If you take into account foreign exchange conversion, underlying EBITDA was down 3% mainly related to the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Some comments on the market. First one is a strong demand growth in the oil and gas market, which reported, both double-digit top line and bottom line organic growth in Advanced Formulations. We've seen -- thanks to the strong demand, we've seen both an impact on volume but also on prices. But overall, the performance of Advanced Formulations cluster was indeed very strong. Consistent growth demand for high-performance polymers continued across several application, in particular the automotive market where we benefit both from the dynamic of the market but also from the fact that our technology fits very well with the latest trend, and we see us gaining share either for the development of electric vehicles or for the use of our newest technologies instead of the traditional one. Steady broad-based growth continues in composite international aircraft, military and returning strand in business jet and helicopter. 
In fact, I was in San [indiscernible] last week with our teams, and we are very encouraged to see both the dynamic of industry, but also our ability to sign long-term commitment with some of our key customers, including Safran, Airbus and Spirit, the company who is producing IO structure. Overall, a very positive environment as far as the level of demand is concerned, and we're feeling that in fact this market turns as we expected as a long-term growth market.
Maybe also a comment on our Performance Chemicals business because I think we are coming now with a key answer on our soda ash. It's able to resist from the increasing capacity in Europe. We are resisting very well line of context, which is pretty favorable and my expectation is that from where we landed today, we'll see from that opportunities to return to a situation where we grow our profitability in this business.
Looking at the pricing, you see that we've been able to present a slightly positive, I would say probably, almost neutral pricing power, which is good. It shows that indeed, we are able to maintain our margins at a pretty reasonable level in an environment where we continue to see some raw material and energy inflation. And this leads to a margin very strong at record 23%, which puts us very well within the group of European-headquartered diversified chemical company.
With that, I will turn to Karim to ask him to give us a bit more flavor on these financial results. Karim?"

As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website.

As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And as you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on a basis that also reflects the discontinuation of the polyamide activities. Our pickup, well, Jean-Pierre was talking about, in terms of the market dynamics and we are looking at our sales. Let's get Slide #8. You'll see the fact is that sales are up 6% on an organic basis and volumes and mix represented about 5% of that. A lot of that has come from our growth operating segments. So Advanced Formulations' sales were up 10% on an organic basis in the first half and that, clearly, is driven by strong momentum in oil and gas, where our technologies truly help our customers maximize yield and efficiencies.
Other market supported the growth, and I'm thinking here of mining chemicals, where demand increased, and we're also benefiting from some small mine openings. We're confident this is the beginning of quite a few quarters ahead of us of a similar nature. But there's more. We've seen growth in coatings and home and personal care, which also delivered growth, albeit at a more moderated level.
Turning to Advanced Materials. The fact is sales was up -- were up 4.5% organically in the half, driven by the auto market, where the trends for fuel efficiency electrification are continuing to drive the momentum and the need for a truly advanced polymer technologies. Demand from smart devices was substantially below last year, and we're expecting that trend to continue into second half and into the third quarter in particular.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, composite sales to aeronautics is also growing significantly across a number of the programs where we are present, reflecting the ongoing need for fuel-efficient aircraft, which again, require the use of high-performance composites. Now the growth is broad based. We kit in commercial and military aircraft, but it's also really pleasing to see business jets and helicopters drive that momentum as well.
Performance Chemicals, sales are up 4% on an organic basis. And we've seen volume growth, both in soda ash and in peroxides. Indeed the robust demand environment in soda ash means that our plants are operating at very high utilization levels.
So all in all, good top line organic performance for the first half of the year. That said, when you factor in foreign-exchange impact, underlying sales are down nearly 2%, predominantly because of the U.S. dollar impact.
What about the EBITDA? If we turn to Slide #9, what you will see is that organically, it grew 6%. Now it reflects all the benefits of the growth in volumes that are referred to previously, but also some pretty positive dynamics across many of our businesses, and that helped to overcome higher energy and raw material costs such as, for example, higher fuel [indiscernible] costs in Advanced Materials. And that performance was despite what I would consider to be modest headwinds that we saw earlier in the year related, for example, to transport strikes in Brazil to multi-week shutdown of the Silica plant in China. I would also -- despite what we had actually indicated there was going to come but EUR 12 million reduction in synergies that reflected -- that related to medical benefits, post-retirement benefits. Again, this was not a surprise. We had flagged it earlier in the year. But to show that growth despite those factors, to my mind gives you an indication of the sources of the quality of the growth in our portfolio. That is not enough because when you factor in the foreign exchange conversion impacts as well as some scope impacts, what you see, as a matter of fact, is that underlying EBITDA, as reported, is down 3% year-on-year.
If you turn to Slide #10, you'll see also that our net income from continuing businesses is up 7% despite the lower EBITDA, despite the adverse foreign exchange impact. Why is that? Two reasons: lower financial charges that reflects 2 things, deleveraging that you've seen us deliver in the last couple of years, but also the optimization of our debt. We've retired some pretty expensive debt last year, and that's having a very clear impact on our results and our cash. And we also see a reduction in our underlying tax rates from 29% last year to 25% this year. Indeed, the positive development from the financing charges and tax rates have helped to propel our EPS, our earnings per share from continuing businesses by nearly 9% in this half, and that's despite the adverse foreign exchange impacts. 
So as far as cash is concerned, we remain totally focused on generating strong cash and converting strong profits into cash flow. The factors that are free cash flow from continuing businesses of EUR 123 million was down in last year, largely because of a modest build in working capital, which reflects the phasing of our sales growth late in the second quarter. The good news as well is that the free cash flow to shareholders increased from EUR 33 million last year to EUR 77 million last year. And I'll remind you that cash flow measures is after financing costs. So the fact that it increased reflects 2 things, lower financial charges, which I have alluded to, and also strong cash flow from our discontinued operations.
There's one final point before I turn back to Jean-Pierre and that is I'll give you an update on the simplification plans we announced in the first quarter. The great news is that the dialogue with our social partners has concluded constructively, and we are now moving from planning to execution mode. As a result of the improved clarity that follows the conclusion of the social procedures and the modest increase actually in the number of job suppressions, we've increased our total provision by EUR 43 million to total of EUR 178 million. Those cash restructuring expense this year is unchanged. We expect it to be unchanged at about EUR 30 million this year, and that is completely factored into our outlook.
And with that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

After all the questions we had in past",611,"Thank you very much, Karim. So maybe just a few comments before opening the Q&A. So I think 2 key takeaways from Karim's presentation. The first one is, again, reassuring our outlook regarding Performance Chemicals. After all the questions we had in past quarters, I think it's very good to see that the business is managing very well in the current environment. And despite the new capacity coming into Europe, we see that our plants today are operating at full capacity. And I'm pretty optimistic that the combination of all the business within Performance Chemicals will indeed perform better than we expected at the beginning of the year. Second important point is about Advanced Formulations. There were some questions in past years about the ability of this business. To grow, I think what we see during this semester show that there are, indeed, opportunities. It's oil and gas, but not just oil and gas. Most of the segment that north gas serves, with the exception of Agro, which was a pretty flattish, have demonstrated significant opportunities for both volume growth and improved pricing.
So now if I comment too quickly on the priorities for the remaining of the year, the first one, obviously, is the completion of the Polyamide sale. You've seen that the European Commission not completely surprisingly is asking a number of questions, which leads us to move into the Phase II approach to this antitrust clearance. But together, we are with BSF. We are very aligned and confident regarding the completion of this project.
From an operational standpoint, we just confirm our guidance. We expect to generate an underlying EBITDA estimated cost -- estimated at 5% to 7% for the full year. We've just done 6% for this first half. And we will convert that performance into strong free cash flow. And despite the performance, which was a little bit on the soft side as far as free cash flow is concerned for the reason that Karim has explained, we are very confident that for the full year, we'll be in line with or exceed our guidance. But again, we are preparing for the future. The key priority is, as I mentioned, is really to focus on the simplification of our organization. We want to become much more customer focused. We want to deliver a superior customer experience to our partners, and this is why we need to have a lean and very efficient organization.
You know also that this year is a year where the board of Slovay is working on CEO succession. We are still operating within the expected time frame, and I would expect to hand over around year end. We had an update on this process at the board meeting yesterday, and I feel very comfortable where this will be the case, and we should probably expect an announcement within the month of October.
Then last point, you know that we will all be holding with my colleagues from the Comex an update for investors in London on September 24. I hope we will see a lot of you there, and it will be an opportunity to have a direct dialogue. And frankly speaking, for people who wonder whether it makes sense to have such meeting few months before CEO succession. I can just confirm to you that the board is clearly very comfortable with Solvac around strategy, and you should not expect a new CEO coming to implement different strategies. So I think what we'll be able to share with you on September 24 will indeed make a lot of sense.
And with that, we are ready with Karim to take your questions."

Again, with one exception, which is the ag market which was, I would say, pretty soft. For all the other markets, we've seen significant opportunities for volume gain and conditions, which help us improve our pricing in the context where as we've commented for the last few quarters, we have improved our position as far as access to raw materials is concerned. So these are really the key fact. And yes, we've seen a bit more of some of the higher-value product being sold, but I would consider that as a weaker effect in comparison to volume and prices.

One is the fact that 2017 performance was stronger than in 2016, which meant that the verbal remuneration of bonuses, which are fully provided for in '17 are paid out in second quarter of '18. So what you basically have is a variable remuneration that is higher this year than last year, that is one factor to highlight. More importantly, and the majority of the reasons for that cash flow is, as I said before, which is we built some working capital. We are very modest, and I'll explain too what I mean by that. Our working capital, which in gross terms, if you add up payables, receivables, inventories is EUR 4.5 billion. We're talking of 2% to 3% build because we want to make sure we can be there for our customers with the inventories to meet strong demand dynamics. And when you see strong demand dynamics of growth in May and June, absolutely, we've built some working capital. We don't normally see that in the mid-November to December time frames. So at this point in time, things are exactly where we thought they'd be. Obviously we look at or I look at some of the key more operational KPIs overdue, day sales outstanding, same with payables, inventory turns. There is not a single thing on that dashboard that is making anything other than green. So yes, more work to do, but we've got a good track record and sort of discipline and focus. Absolutely confident we will deliver it, which is why reiterated our guidance. Does that help?"

The first one is our design choices made by our key customer, which in some cases favors, in other cases don't favor our polymer solutions. And the second are specific production forecasts. But at end of the day, we see less of a contribution of smart devices into our results. Overall, I would say it's probably good news, I mean, any business is welcome, but this reduces a bit of dependency with specific segment and to say the specific customer. It will continue to be a very important one, but [indiscernible] of the business continues to grow very well, allowing us to derisk and have better spread of activities in the Specialty Polymers, spread of exposure, I should say, in the Specialty Polymers business. So overall, I think that we are demonstrating our ability during this year to go through this reduction of activity in smart devices without major impact on our growth trajectory.
For CEO succession, I'll be discrete as you would imagine. I mean, this is really a process that the board is in charge of. I'm contributing to the process. I'm aware of where we are, but I guess not at the point where we want to make too many public comments. Regarding the profile, yes, we need someone who can continue the transformation of the group within the strategy that the board has approved. And the board has -- is very insistent on the fact that they want the strategy to be continued, and discussions with potential candidates are based on this assumption. We want to look in details, both at external and internal candidates, and it's the reason why the process takes a bit of time. I would say not an extraordinary period of time, if you want to be serious in the identification and analysis of external candidate. My view is that we should stay within the framework that we have announced a few months ago, which means a condition around your hand. And I expect, once again, an announcement to be made during the month of October. So this is probably the best update and summary that I can give you."

This is really the results of all the efforts we've done during the past few years, where we are facing a very changing market. And we took this opportunity both to work on the improvement of the performance of our product, and at the same time, make sure that we could build a much more effective supply chain in the market where we've seen a number of competitors disappearing. So we're pretty pleased with this situation that we're expecting, but it's good when it happens, where we see volume opportunities but also opportunities to make sure we get the right price for our product.
Peroxide, you're right to mention. A number of positive reasons and our Saudi plant is ramping up or has ramped up very well, and in fact, we see a very significant volume there, that's good. But we see also good news across the globe. The North American situation has normalized for us, and we see some of our key customers doing well, which is good. 
Favorable pricing in Asia, so pretty nice picture on peroxide. And soda ash, I can just reiterate what I was saying. We see an overall good level of demand. Volume for Turkey are there, but they have been absorbed by this market in a context where we've seen a bit of a reduction of export volumes coming from China. Yes, our view today is that the price should increase in 2019, but that's our view, we have not started negotiation yet with customers. But we think that the situation we had during this year where, once again, we've not been able to fully compensate in the end of '17 negotiation. The expected increase in energy costs, we think that this situation is now behind us, and we are more optimistic regarding our ability to manage this equation better in 2019.

Special Chem has also some core businesses, especially the electronic grade H2O2, but we are in a situation where the development in electronic grade H2O2 don't compensate fully the impact that we are seeing on the insulation market. And maybe to be absolutely comprehensive, we are also seeing some softness for obvious reason in the diesel catalyst market.

So I was just wondering if you could try to indicate what kind of timeline like there is between the moment that a rig is actually added on the field and the moment when they use your products and it actually materializes into revenues for you. So that'll be the first question. And the second one would be actually on your PVDF plant. So I know that you already flagged last year that battery Specialty Polymers remains a small business for you. But given that, that plant is ramping up and that now you clearly flag it as a driver of your volumes growth, I was wondering how small is it now or how big is it becoming?"

On battery, I will ask you for a bit of patience. We will come with a more specific view on the current situation in battery and our growth expectation, which are quite significant during the market update in September. I think that's something where we need to give a bit more visibility to the market, but I would rather wait until we have an opportunity for a bit more detailed discussion because, indeed, this is becoming significant for Solvay and growth opportunities in this segment are quite impressive. For oil and gas, a lot of people are using rig count as a simple driver for the development of stimulation activities in unconventional oil and gas. This is a bit of the simplistic proxy because we see more and more situations where people could have different strategy once they've drilled a hole, and we see also a situation where, as technology evolves, people can demand more simulation with just 1 single hole. So not easy to answer to your question. What I can mention is that we continue to see on the ground, a very strong level of activities and people willing to increase the production, and this calls for more stimulation. So the dynamic there is pretty good, and we expect to continue to benefit from that. And by the way, the latest news on oil prices are probably also pushing forward. But don't get this simple view that people would drill a hole. The next day, they will do stimulation using our product. Strategies and technologies are becoming much more complex and sophisticated, and there is less of link and probably even less of set lag time between the time of the drilling and the actual use of our product."

But again in the overall cluster of Advanced Materials, these are pretty -- these are the second order degree -- second degree order impact. Overall the pricing situation, especially in Specialty Polymers and in composite is very good. And we don't see any issue. By the way, the margin that we generate on this segment is -- demonstrates that. [indiscernible], good volumes, good pricing impact. So yes, indeed, the business is doing very well with some new product being brought into the market, which are linked to the vanillin chain, but which are a bit original, especially the bio vanillin product, which brings significant margin.

I'm here in Brussels with our CFO, Karim, and our new head of IR, [indiscernible]. I would like to share, as usual, some introductory comments and then we'll -- Karim will take over to drive you into more details or guide you into more details of our results.
[indiscernible] first comment is that we are presenting half year results. We think that it makes really sense in the business like ours to focus on -- which is a bit of a longer-term approach. So you have all the information related to the quarter, and we'll certainly be delighted to answer your question, giving you specific quarterly analysis or quarterly trend if necessary. But again, I think it makes real sense to focus more on what we've been able to achieve in the half year. So clearly, I think the headline is pretty simple. We have been able to generate strong volume growth in businesses, which are in our key growth areas, which help us compensate for the still significantly negative foreign exchange impact.
Organic net sales grew 6% driven by strong volume growth in Advanced Formulations and Advanced Materials. Organic EBITDA growth was 6%, in line with our expectation. If you take into account foreign exchange conversion, underlying EBITDA was down 3% mainly related to the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Some comments on the market. First one is a strong demand growth in the oil and gas market, which reported, both double-digit top line and bottom line organic growth in Advanced Formulations. We've seen -- thanks to the strong demand, we've seen both an impact on volume but also on prices. But overall, the performance of Advanced Formulations cluster was indeed very strong. Consistent growth demand for high-performance polymers continued across several application, in particular the automotive market where we benefit both from the dynamic of the market but also from the fact that our technology fits very well with the latest trend, and we see us gaining share either for the development of electric vehicles or for the use of our newest technologies instead of the traditional one. Steady broad-based growth continues in composite international aircraft, military and returning strand in business jet and helicopter. 
In fact, I was in San [indiscernible] last week with our teams, and we are very encouraged to see both the dynamic of industry, but also our ability to sign long-term commitment with some of our key customers, including Safran, Airbus and Spirit, the company who is producing IO structure. Overall, a very positive environment as far as the level of demand is concerned, and we're feeling that in fact this market turns as we expected as a long-term growth market.
Maybe also a comment on our Performance Chemicals business because I think we are coming now with a key answer on our soda ash. It's able to resist from the increasing capacity in Europe. We are resisting very well line of context, which is pretty favorable and my expectation is that from where we landed today, we'll see from that opportunities to return to a situation where we grow our profitability in this business.
Looking at the pricing, you see that we've been able to present a slightly positive, I would say probably, almost neutral pricing power, which is good. It shows that indeed, we are able to maintain our margins at a pretty reasonable level in an environment where we continue to see some raw material and energy inflation. And this leads to a margin very strong at record 23%, which puts us very well within the group of European-headquartered diversified chemical company.
With that, I will turn to Karim to ask him to give us a bit more flavor on these financial results. Karim?"
377837,575640448,1523158,"Solvay SA, H1 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And as you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on a basis that also reflects the disconti",1038,"Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And as you know, I referred to figures that are on an underlying basis, and of course, on a basis that also reflects the discontinuation of the polyamide activities. Our pickup, well, Jean-Pierre was talking about, in terms of the market dynamics and we are looking at our sales. Let's get Slide #8. You'll see the fact is that sales are up 6% on an organic basis and volumes and mix represented about 5% of that. A lot of that has come from our growth operating segments. So Advanced Formulations' sales were up 10% on an organic basis in the first half and that, clearly, is driven by strong momentum in oil and gas, where our technologies truly help our customers maximize yield and efficiencies.
Other market supported the growth, and I'm thinking here of mining chemicals, where demand increased, and we're also benefiting from some small mine openings. We're confident this is the beginning of quite a few quarters ahead of us of a similar nature. But there's more. We've seen growth in coatings and home and personal care, which also delivered growth, albeit at a more moderated level.
Turning to Advanced Materials. The fact is sales was up -- were up 4.5% organically in the half, driven by the auto market, where the trends for fuel efficiency electrification are continuing to drive the momentum and the need for a truly advanced polymer technologies. Demand from smart devices was substantially below last year, and we're expecting that trend to continue into second half and into the third quarter in particular.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, composite sales to aeronautics is also growing significantly across a number of the programs where we are present, reflecting the ongoing need for fuel-efficient aircraft, which again, require the use of high-performance composites. Now the growth is broad based. We kit in commercial and military aircraft, but it's also really pleasing to see business jets and helicopters drive that momentum as well.
Performance Chemicals, sales are up 4% on an organic basis. And we've seen volume growth, both in soda ash and in peroxides. Indeed the robust demand environment in soda ash means that our plants are operating at very high utilization levels.
So all in all, good top line organic performance for the first half of the year. That said, when you factor in foreign-exchange impact, underlying sales are down nearly 2%, predominantly because of the U.S. dollar impact.
What about the EBITDA? If we turn to Slide #9, what you will see is that organically, it grew 6%. Now it reflects all the benefits of the growth in volumes that are referred to previously, but also some pretty positive dynamics across many of our businesses, and that helped to overcome higher energy and raw material costs such as, for example, higher fuel [indiscernible] costs in Advanced Materials. And that performance was despite what I would consider to be modest headwinds that we saw earlier in the year related, for example, to transport strikes in Brazil to multi-week shutdown of the Silica plant in China. I would also -- despite what we had actually indicated there was going to come but EUR 12 million reduction in synergies that reflected -- that related to medical benefits, post-retirement benefits. Again, this was not a surprise. We had flagged it earlier in the year. But to show that growth despite those factors, to my mind gives you an indication of the sources of the quality of the growth in our portfolio. That is not enough because when you factor in the foreign exchange conversion impacts as well as some scope impacts, what you see, as a matter of fact, is that underlying EBITDA, as reported, is down 3% year-on-year.
If you turn to Slide #10, you'll see also that our net income from continuing businesses is up 7% despite the lower EBITDA, despite the adverse foreign exchange impact. Why is that? Two reasons: lower financial charges that reflects 2 things, deleveraging that you've seen us deliver in the last couple of years, but also the optimization of our debt. We've retired some pretty expensive debt last year, and that's having a very clear impact on our results and our cash. And we also see a reduction in our underlying tax rates from 29% last year to 25% this year. Indeed, the positive development from the financing charges and tax rates have helped to propel our EPS, our earnings per share from continuing businesses by nearly 9% in this half, and that's despite the adverse foreign exchange impacts. 
So as far as cash is concerned, we remain totally focused on generating strong cash and converting strong profits into cash flow. The factors that are free cash flow from continuing businesses of EUR 123 million was down in last year, largely because of a modest build in working capital, which reflects the phasing of our sales growth late in the second quarter. The good news as well is that the free cash flow to shareholders increased from EUR 33 million last year to EUR 77 million last year. And I'll remind you that cash flow measures is after financing costs. So the fact that it increased reflects 2 things, lower financial charges, which I have alluded to, and also strong cash flow from our discontinued operations.
There's one final point before I turn back to Jean-Pierre and that is I'll give you an update on the simplification plans we announced in the first quarter. The great news is that the dialogue with our social partners has concluded constructively, and we are now moving from planning to execution mode. As a result of the improved clarity that follows the conclusion of the social procedures and the modest increase actually in the number of job suppressions, we've increased our total provision by EUR 43 million to total of EUR 178 million. Those cash restructuring expense this year is unchanged. We expect it to be unchanged at about EUR 30 million this year, and that is completely factored into our outlook.
And with that, I'll hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

So maybe just a few comments before opening the Q&A. So I think 2 key takeaways from Karim's presentation. The first one is, again, reassuring our outlook regarding Performance Chemicals. After all the questions we had in past",611,"Thank you very much, Karim. So maybe just a few comments before opening the Q&A. So I think 2 key takeaways from Karim's presentation. The first one is, again, reassuring our outlook regarding Performance Chemicals. After all the questions we had in past quarters, I think it's very good to see that the business is managing very well in the current environment. And despite the new capacity coming into Europe, we see that our plants today are operating at full capacity. And I'm pretty optimistic that the combination of all the business within Performance Chemicals will indeed perform better than we expected at the beginning of the year. Second important point is about Advanced Formulations. There were some questions in past years about the ability of this business. To grow, I think what we see during this semester show that there are, indeed, opportunities. It's oil and gas, but not just oil and gas. Most of the segment that north gas serves, with the exception of Agro, which was a pretty flattish, have demonstrated significant opportunities for both volume growth and improved pricing.
So now if I comment too quickly on the priorities for the remaining of the year, the first one, obviously, is the completion of the Polyamide sale. You've seen that the European Commission not completely surprisingly is asking a number of questions, which leads us to move into the Phase II approach to this antitrust clearance. But together, we are with BSF. We are very aligned and confident regarding the completion of this project.
From an operational standpoint, we just confirm our guidance. We expect to generate an underlying EBITDA estimated cost -- estimated at 5% to 7% for the full year. We've just done 6% for this first half. And we will convert that performance into strong free cash flow. And despite the performance, which was a little bit on the soft side as far as free cash flow is concerned for the reason that Karim has explained, we are very confident that for the full year, we'll be in line with or exceed our guidance. But again, we are preparing for the future. The key priority is, as I mentioned, is really to focus on the simplification of our organization. We want to become much more customer focused. We want to deliver a superior customer experience to our partners, and this is why we need to have a lean and very efficient organization.
You know also that this year is a year where the board of Slovay is working on CEO succession. We are still operating within the expected time frame, and I would expect to hand over around year end. We had an update on this process at the board meeting yesterday, and I feel very comfortable where this will be the case, and we should probably expect an announcement within the month of October.
Then last point, you know that we will all be holding with my colleagues from the Comex an update for investors in London on September 24. I hope we will see a lot of you there, and it will be an opportunity to have a direct dialogue. And frankly speaking, for people who wonder whether it makes sense to have such meeting few months before CEO succession. I can just confirm to you that the board is clearly very comfortable with Solvac around strategy, and you should not expect a new CEO coming to implement different strategies. So I think what we'll be able to share with you on September 24 will indeed make a lot of sense.
And with that, we are ready with Karim to take your questions."

Again, with one exception, which is the ag market which was, I would say, pretty soft. For all the other markets, we've seen significant opportunities for volume gain and conditions, which help us improve our pricing in the context where as we've commented for the last few quarters, we have improved our position as far as access to raw materials is concerned. So these are really the key fact. And yes, we've seen a bit more of some of the higher-value product being sold, but I would consider that as a weaker effect in comparison to volume and prices.

Thomas, on the free cash flow, there are probably 2 key factors I want to highlight. One is the fact that 2017 performance was stronger than in 2016, which meant that the verbal remuneration of bonuses, which are fully provided for in '17 are paid out in second quarter of '18. So what you basically have is a variable remuneration that is higher this year than last year, that is one factor to highlight. More importantly, and the majority of the reasons for that cash flow is, as I said before, which is we built some working capital. We are very modest, and I'll explain too what I mean by that. Our working capital, which in gross terms, if you add up payables, receivables, inventories is EUR 4.5 billion. We're talking of 2% to 3% build because we want to make sure we can be there for our customers with the inventories to meet strong demand dynamics. And when you see strong demand dynamics of growth in May and June, absolutely, we've built some working capital. We don't normally see that in the mid-November to December time frames. So at this point in time, things are exactly where we thought they'd be. Obviously we look at or I look at some of the key more operational KPIs overdue, day sales outstanding, same with payables, inventory turns. There is not a single thing on that dashboard that is making anything other than green. So yes, more work to do, but we've got a good track record and sort of discipline and focus. Absolutely confident we will deliver it, which is why reiterated our guidance. Does that help?"

I think we are seeing some softness there and probably a bit of a decrease in activity, which is leading to a couple of things. The first one is our design choices made by our key customer, which in some cases favors, in other cases don't favor our polymer solutions. And the second are specific production forecasts. But at end of the day, we see less of a contribution of smart devices into our results. Overall, I would say it's probably good news, I mean, any business is welcome, but this reduces a bit of dependency with specific segment and to say the specific customer. It will continue to be a very important one, but [indiscernible] of the business continues to grow very well, allowing us to derisk and have better spread of activities in the Specialty Polymers, spread of exposure, I should say, in the Specialty Polymers business. So overall, I think that we are demonstrating our ability during this year to go through this reduction of activity in smart devices without major impact on our growth trajectory.
For CEO succession, I'll be discrete as you would imagine. I mean, this is really a process that the board is in charge of. I'm contributing to the process. I'm aware of where we are, but I guess not at the point where we want to make too many public comments. Regarding the profile, yes, we need someone who can continue the transformation of the group within the strategy that the board has approved. And the board has -- is very insistent on the fact that they want the strategy to be continued, and discussions with potential candidates are based on this assumption. We want to look in details, both at external and internal candidates, and it's the reason why the process takes a bit of time. I would say not an extraordinary period of time, if you want to be serious in the identification and analysis of external candidate. My view is that we should stay within the framework that we have announced a few months ago, which means a condition around your hand. And I expect, once again, an announcement to be made during the month of October. So this is probably the best update and summary that I can give you."

But in this context, we have been able indeed to manage pricing very well. The reason is simple. We bring some -- we bring performance to our customers, and at the end of the day what they want is an overall very competitive and effective setup. So we have been able to see in oil and gas, both volume and price increase. This is really the results of all the efforts we've done during the past few years, where we are facing a very changing market. And we took this opportunity both to work on the improvement of the performance of our product, and at the same time, make sure that we could build a much more effective supply chain in the market where we've seen a number of competitors disappearing. So we're pretty pleased with this situation that we're expecting, but it's good when it happens, where we see volume opportunities but also opportunities to make sure we get the right price for our product.
Peroxide, you're right to mention. A number of positive reasons and our Saudi plant is ramping up or has ramped up very well, and in fact, we see a very significant volume there, that's good. But we see also good news across the globe. The North American situation has normalized for us, and we see some of our key customers doing well, which is good. 
Favorable pricing in Asia, so pretty nice picture on peroxide. And soda ash, I can just reiterate what I was saying. We see an overall good level of demand. Volume for Turkey are there, but they have been absorbed by this market in a context where we've seen a bit of a reduction of export volumes coming from China. Yes, our view today is that the price should increase in 2019, but that's our view, we have not started negotiation yet with customers. But we think that the situation we had during this year where, once again, we've not been able to fully compensate in the end of '17 negotiation. The expected increase in energy costs, we think that this situation is now behind us, and we are more optimistic regarding our ability to manage this equation better in 2019. Hence, our view that things should gradually improve in the Performance Chemicals cluster from where we are today."

And I'll remind you in aerospace that we are benefiting from 2 large programs, large volume program, which are still in a very steep ramp-up phase from pretty low volumes to volumes which would become more and more significant. One is the F45 from Lockheed Martins and the other one is really [indiscernible]. So this is really something which will play in the next -- in the years to come.

We are using carbonated gases to do that, and we are obviously seeing some challenges in this market, so the turnover explanation. Special Chem has also some core businesses, especially the electronic grade H2O2, but we are in a situation where the development in electronic grade H2O2 don't compensate fully the impact that we are seeing on the insulation market. And maybe to be absolutely comprehensive, we are also seeing some softness for obvious reason in the diesel catalyst market. I think with Special Chem, we serve both diesel and gasoline, but probably more value-added on diesel, and the market in Europe is turning quite steeply in the direction of more gasoline engine vehicle. So smart devices on one hand in Specialty Polymers, and within Special Chem, insulation and diesel to gasoline, these are really the components which explain this slightly softer growth in Advanced Materials."

I think that's something where we need to give a bit more visibility to the market, but I would rather wait until we have an opportunity for a bit more detailed discussion because, indeed, this is becoming significant for Solvay and growth opportunities in this segment are quite impressive. For oil and gas, a lot of people are using rig count as a simple driver for the development of stimulation activities in unconventional oil and gas. This is a bit of the simplistic proxy because we see more and more situations where people could have different strategy once they've drilled a hole, and we see also a situation where, as technology evolves, people can demand more simulation with just 1 single hole. So not easy to answer to your question. What I can mention is that we continue to see on the ground, a very strong level of activities and people willing to increase the production, and this calls for more stimulation. So the dynamic there is pretty good, and we expect to continue to benefit from that. And by the way, the latest news on oil prices are probably also pushing forward. But don't get this simple view that people would drill a hole. The next day, they will do stimulation using our product. Strategies and technologies are becoming much more complex and sophisticated, and there is less of link and probably even less of set lag time between the time of the drilling and the actual use of our product."

That is ongoing work, that is an ongoing very legitimate normal conversation. Once we conclude it and once we're able to announce it, we will. But be clear that this is very much in our sights as a worthwhile ambition. Clearly, I expect us to make some progress on that, but at this point, it would be premature to indicate anything more firmly.

So pricing in Advanced Materials, you are right, slightly -- slight pressure there. A couple of explanation. The first one, don't forget the transactional foreign exchange, which is weighing a bit on us as we export. Second and probably in terms of business, the only element where we see some pressure is the floor situation, the floor spa situation. This is into it, I was mentioning earlier on, on the insulation market where we see a bit of a dynamic, a bit of an unfavorable dynamic, which does not allow us to manage well our pricing power. But again in the overall cluster of Advanced Materials, these are pretty -- these are the second order degree -- second degree order impact. Overall the pricing situation, especially in Specialty Polymers and in composite is very good. And we don't see any issue. By the way, the margin that we generate on this segment is -- demonstrates that. [indiscernible], good volumes, good pricing impact. So yes, indeed, the business is doing very well with some new product being brought into the market, which are linked to the vanillin chain, but which are a bit original, especially the bio vanillin product, which brings significant margin. So good news there in more or less on all fronts. And [indiscernible] too are also in the current context showing good opportunities. So it's a business -- it's a small business, which is doing well.
Well, with that, I would suggest that we bring this call to a conclusion. I would like to thank all of you for your participation.

I'm here in Brussels with Karim, our CFO, and as usual, we would like to go through our results same sequence, as usual. I will make a few introductory comments, turning to Karim for more details on presentation and then come back with a few concluding statements, and we move into the Q&A session. 
I think what we've seen is that is growth is continuing into Q3, and we get during this quarter also some support of pricing, which leaves us for the first 9 months of the year to an organic net sales growth of 6% driven by volume growth in all 3 segments you've seen a bit of a differentiation between this Net pricing for the group is 2% higher despite rising volatile costs. This clearly shows the strength of our pricing power and liquidity of our portfolio. 
Margins remain quite strong at 22%, which is a European is a pretty good level. 
Going quickly on what I think of the key business results that's worth considering at the beginning of this call. Volumes sold into the oil and gas market our double-digit EBITDA growth in Advanced Formulations for the 9 months period. So clearly, this is a segment, which is showing during this first 9 months of 2018 the best performance as far as the group's concern. 
We saw in oil and gas a bit of stabilization late Q3. However, the demand in other markets, such as Agro and Coatis should improvement and a group of the segment in the third quarter also. Very good performance and no real worries in oil and gas stabilization is linked to a number of bottleneck that have developed downstream in this very active segment, but the dynamics is very good. Very good dynamics also in top line of Composite, especially composite used in aircraft. High single-digit growth. Main driver of the military program, the which is indeed becoming quite successful and commercial programs ramp-up, mostly at Berlin, where we have the largest exposure of 787 and 737. And we continue to see a very, very good momentum and full order books for many years going forward in these 2 segments, both military program and commercial aircraft. 
Specialty Polymers. There is a significant growth, namely in Automotive and application and this overcame the anticipated reduction in small devices. We knew, and I think it's probably a really good thing that, small devices will be less contributive to this year. When I say it's good is that at the end of the day, the objective is to have a very balanced exposure into a number of different markets and probably we came a couple of years ago in the situation where small devices were contributing a little bit too much. So overall, a very good for our Specialty Polymers business. It's the business, which has significant exposure to the automotive industry, and I know that there's a number of headlines this days showing -- demonstrating concerns regarding the performance of the auto sector. Just a few comments there. Polymers sold remained the contributor of growth, including in the third quarter. We've seen some signs of softness in September, and our order books, and we're watching development closely. 
Results are very different, number of our regulatory supply in Europe. A bit of a softness in the end market in China and then we've seen people in supply chain adjusting their level of inventories accordingly. I remind you that in the past few years, we've grown in the auto sector 3x faster than the overall growth of the market because our product are very much part of the transformation of this auto segment, and we are overall quite optimistic on the fact that we are very well prepared for any changes short-term or long-term, which can happen in the auto market. Overall, results to date are in line with expectations, and I'm very confident in our ability to capture many of the significant opportunities for us across the midterm. We've shared with the market, London in mid-September midterm view for the various businesses, and what we've seen developing since that is our emerging support of the comments we've made during this market With that, Karim, can you give us some insight into our financial performance?"

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results, I'm going to refer to articles underlying basis and reflect discontinuation of the Polyamide activities. I'll star",805,"Absolutely. Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Hello, everybody. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results, I'm going to refer to articles underlying basis and reflect discontinuation of the Polyamide activities. 
I'll start with sales. On Slide 8, you will see that our organic sales increased by 6% over the 9 months, and volumes and mix represented 4% of that growth, the balance related to pricing. 
Advanced Formulations. Organic sales of 11%, driven mostly by volume, but also by some price benefits. Now the main drivers of the growth related to this is recovery in the oil and gas market, especially in the first 7 to 8 months of the year. Jean-Pierre talked about stabilization of sales that period. We have also seen deliberate growth in Agro and coatings. Mine chemicals is growing strongly. We have seen additional volumes are related to new mine openings indeed and by example, we secured a new copper business in the Democratic Republic of and in because Kazakhstan and South Africa. We also benefited from demand growth from cobalt reef findings in Turkey and in China. 
Advanced Materials. Sales grew 4% organically, as Jean-Pierre indicated, driven by the automotive market where the trend for fuel-efficient vehicles continue to support the greater use of our polymer technology across the market platforms from hybrids, electric vehicles, et cetera.
Volume growth was also driven by higher composite sales to aeronautics and, indeed, we're seeing high single-digit growth in that domain. Now that's what generated most of the growth, although we'll see some positive contributions and good growth in health care. But Polymer use is increasing across a number of different medical applications. We have also had a few headwinds in some of the smaller markets. John. Talk about the substantial decline in sales this month. Device market versus last year and we experienced a reduction in sales and installation agents as well as and catalysts used in diesel fuels. 
Performance Chemicals. Strong growth, organic sales up 6% merely, 4% of that related to pricing, 2% volumes. The increase was attributed to both and soda ash when we were benefiting from robust demand environment, strong and soda ash operating at very high levels. 
Our Coatis business also contributed to the sales growth thanks to a of the domestic demand and in the Latin American region. But all in all, a good top line organic growth year-to-date. The course of gravity and scope and foreign exchange and factors restricted the underlying sales growth to 1.5%. 
Turning to EBITDA on Slide 9. You'll have noticed the 6% organic growth in the 9-month period, although again, scope of foreign exchange meant that EBITDA is down [ 0.78 ]%. And organic growth of 6% reflects the impact of the strong volume growth that I referred to just now. And had a 7% positive impact on our EBITDA evolution. 
We've also had good pricing dynamics across many of our businesses and that helped to overcome the higher energy and raw material costs. I wish to highlight an increase in fixed costs and that predominantly reflects the capability that we're building to support our growth. For example, in the opposite business, we're also investing in some initiatives that are focused on improving our productivity, and driving even more operating efficiencies is as we prepare for the continued volume growth in that we see ahead of us. 
If I turn to net income on Slide 10, you will notice net income -- our net income from continuing businesses is up 10% and that is despite the 1% -- 1.7% reduction in reported underlying EBITDA. Why is that? Quite simple. To reflect the benefits related to the ongoing decrease in financial charges as we deleverage and also a reduction in our underlying tax rate, which is now 25%, 2% better than last year. These positive developments supported EPS growth and especially growth from our continuing operations, like-for-like with an increase of 11% in EPS. And that is despite scope and foreign exchange impact. Cash is and always a remain high on the agenda. I'm not turning to Slide 11. 
Free cash flow from continuing operations at EUR 275 million through 9 months is down last year, predominantly as we build higher working capital inventory, in particular, in order to meet increased demand from our customers, but also ahead of planned regular maintenance symptoms. As a look at the free cash flow to shareholders, which I'll remind you is after financial charges, they increased 7% to EUR 271 million in the first 9 months. Now this reflects the profits and financial charges I alluded to, but more importantly, continued strong performance and high cash from our discontinued operations in 2018 relative to the same period last year. And with that, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

Priorities for us are very clear. current market circumstances and seen change in the first weeks of the last quarter, we expect organic EBITDA growth around 5% to 6% within the range provided at the start of the year. We also confirm that we'll convert that performance into strong cash flow generation. We know as the macro-economic and political are often bringing some uncertainties. We cannot control those variables, obviously, so we are focusing on what's in our control, including focus on innovation and customers and delivering growth and cash.

But we don't have any signs that this is degrading. On the specialty -- on the Special Chem business, we have a small business, in Special Chem, which produces the gases which are used for installation application from blowing in application protocol these gases will be phased out over the next few years. We've seen a bit of an acceleration. So nothing overall unexpected, but the situation, which should degrade a bit faster, than we're are thinking and as we are very much sort of focusing on growth indeed overall small impact is visible. If we look at the performance of the advanced metal crystal because the Special Chem is consolidated within the advanced metal crystal. Peroxide, frankly, speaking, we're very pleased with the current footprint. Strong market leader. And no reason for us to look for a these small acquisitions here and there.

And we still see here a number of operational hiccups, operational inefficiencies or opportunities for us opportunities for us to pull the delivery and, and we're working very hard on this. We're making sure that the business management team is very much focused both in the customer, but also on the optimization of the operations and the delivery.

We've lost some sales in this part It has been compensated by areas where margins are slightly less favorable. But frankly, speaking, we too much into these types of detail like this.

The first one is, obviously, the business. Again,it's a few tens of millions in terms of sales. So it's pretty small and it's one of the reason why we have not spent much time discussing We know that this business is bound to disappear after certain period of time. The question is really the rate of decrease. And yes, we've been a bit surprised during the first months of the year by a bit of steeper rate of decrease. Second element which is a headwind is the move from diesel to gasoline because we're producing catalysts, and in terms of margins, these are catalysts where we're a bit better than the gasoline catalyst. And the move from diesel to gasoline has been a little bit faster than expected. Now on the positive side, we have batteries. For most of the battery impact today is in Specialty Polymers, but Special Chem is working on some new advanced solutions regarding batteries. And very interesting market, but Special Chem is now addressing is a very chronic market with high-purity or H2O2, which is very successful. So when we bring all of these elements together, yes, we see Special Chem contributing to the growth of the business in the next couple of years. We are just, as we speak, in a situation in 2018 where the negatives were a little bit more significant than we thought or faster than we thought and diesel.

And as usual, we'd like to go through our results, same sequence as usual. I'll make a few introductory comments, turning to Karim for more a detailed presentation and then come back with a few concluding statements, and we'll move into a Q&A session.
I think the -- what we've seen is that volume growth is continuing into Q3, and we get during this quarter also some support of pricing, which leads us for the first 9 months of the year to an organic net sales growth of 6%, driven by volume growth in all 3 segments as you've seen a bit of a differentiation between these 3. Net pricing for the group is 2% higher despite rising raw material costs. This clearly shows the strength of our pricing power and liquidity of our portfolio.
Margins remain quite strong at 22%, which in the European environment is a pretty good level.
Going quickly on what I think are the key business events that are worth considering at the beginning of this call. Volumes sold into the oil and gas market supported our double-digit EBITDA growth in Advanced Formulations for the 9 months period. So clearly, this is a segment which is showing during this first 9 months of 2018 best performance as far as group is concerned. We saw in oil and gas a bit of stabilization late in Q3. However, demand in other markets, such as agro and coating, showed improvement and contributed to the growth of the segment in the third quarter. So very strong performance and no real worries.
In oil and gas, stabilization is linked to a number of bottleneck that have developed downstream in this very active segment, but the dynamics is very good.
Very good dynamic also in -- regarding the top line of composite, especially composite used in aircraft, high single-digit growth. Main driver of the military program, the F45, which is indeed becoming quite successful.
And commercial programs ramp up, mostly at Boeing, where we have largest exposure, 787 and 737. And we continued to see a very, very good momentum and full order books for many years going forward in these 2 segments, both military program and commercial aircraft. 
Specialty Polymers delivered significant growth, namely in automotive and [indiscernible] application, and this overcame the anticipated reduction in smart devices. We knew, and I think it's probably overall a good thing that smart devices will be less contributive to our growth this year. When I say it's good is that at the end of the day, the objective is to have a very balanced exposure into a number of different markets and probably we came a couple of years ago in a situation where smart devices were contributing a little bit too much. So overall, a very good run for Specialty Polymers business. It's a business which has significant exposure to the automotive industry, and I know that there's a number of headlines these days showing -- demonstrating concerns regarding the performance of the auto sector. Just a few comments there. Polymers sold in year 2 remain the contributor of growth, including in the third quarter. We've seen some signs of softness in September and some reduction in our order books, and we are watching development closely. Reasons are very different: number of regulatory, supply chain issues in Europe, a bit of a softness in the end market in China and then we've seen people in the supply chain adjusting their level of inventories accordingly. I remind you that in the past few years, we've grown in the auto sector 3x faster than the overall growth of the market because our product are very much part of the transformation of this auto segment, and we are, overall, quite optimistic on the fact that we are very well prepared for any changes, short term or long term, which can happen in the auto market.
Overall, results to date are in line with our expectation, and I'm very confident in our ability to capture many of the significant opportunities for growth across the midterm. We've shared with the market in London mid-September our midterm view for the various businesses and what we see developing since that is there is emerging support of the comments we've made during this market update.
With that, Karim, can you give us some additional insight into our financial performance?"

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide act",833,"Absolutely. Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Hello, everybody. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide activities. 
I'll start with sales. On Slide 8, you will see that our organic sales increased by 6% over the 9 months, and volumes and mix represented 4% of that growth, the balance related to pricing.
Advanced Formulations. Organic sales up 11%, driven mostly by volume, but also by some price benefits. Now the main drivers of the growth related to this is recovery in the oil and gas market, especially in the first 7 to 8 months of the year. Jean-Pierre has talked about the stabilization since that period. We've also seen and delivered growth in agro and in coatings. Mining chemicals is growing strongly. We're seeing additional volumes related to new mine openings, indeed, and only by way of example, we secured new copper business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Kazakhstan and in South Africa. We also benefited from demand growth from cobalt refineries in Turkey and in China. 
Advanced Materials. Sales grew 4% organically, as Jean-Pierre indicated, driven by the automotive market, where the trend for fuel-efficient vehicles is continuing to support the greater use of our polymer technology across a multitude of platforms, from hybrid, electric vehicles, et cetera.
Volume growth was also driven by higher composite sales to aeronautics and, indeed, we're seeing high single-digit growth in that domain. Now that's what generated most of the growth, although we also saw some positive contributions and good growth in health care, where polymer use is increasing across a number of different medical applications. But we also had a few headwinds in some of the smaller markets. Jean-Pierre has talked about the substantial decline in sales of the smart devices -- device market relative to last year, and we've experienced a reduction in sales in insulation  blowing agents as well as in catalysts that are used in diesel fuels.
Performance Chemicals. Strong growth. Organic sales up 6% nearly, 4% of that related to pricing, 2% volumes. The increase was attributed to both peroxide and soda ash, where we're benefiting from robust demand environment, strong momentum there, and our soda ash plants are operating at very high levels. 
Our Coatis business also contributed to the sales growth, thanks to improved domestic demand in the Latin American region.
So all in all, good top line organic growth year-to-date. But, of course, we can't defy gravity, and scope and foreign exchange in fact restricted the underlying sales growth to 0.5%. 
Turning to EBITDA on Slide 9. You will have noticed the 6% organic growth in the 9-month period, although again, scope and foreign exchange meant that EBITDA is down 0.7%. The organic growth of 6% reflects the impact of the strong volume growth that I've referred to just now and that alone had a 7% positive impact on our EBITDA evolution.
We've also had good pricing dynamics across many of our businesses and that helped to overcome the higher energy and the raw material costs.
I wish to highlight an increase in fixed costs and that predominantly reflects the capability that we're building to support our growth. For example, in the composite business, we're also investing in some initiatives that are focused on improving our productivity, on driving even more operating efficiencies as we prepare for the continued volume growth that we see ahead of us.
If I turn to net income on Slide 10, you will notice that the net income -- our net income from continuing businesses is up 10% and that is despite the 0.7% reduction in reported underlying EBITDA. Why is it? Quite simple. It reflects the benefits related to the ongoing decrease in financial charges as we deleverage and also a reduction in our underlying tax rate, which is now 25%, 2% better than last year. These positive developments supported EPS growth, and especially, growth from our continuing operations, like-for-like, with an increase of 11% in EPS, and that is despite scope and foreign exchange impact.
Cash is and will always remain high on the agenda. I'm now turning to Slide 11.
Free cash flow from continuing operations at EUR 275 million through the 9 months is down than last year, predominantly as we've built higher working capital. We've built inventory, in particular, in order to meet increased demand from our customers, but also ahead of planned regular maintenance shutdowns.
As I look at free cash flow to shareholders, which I'll remind you is after financial charges, they increased 7% to EUR 271 million in the first 9 months. Now this reflects the profit and reduction in financial charges I've alluded to, but more importantly, continued strong performance and high cash generation from our discontinued operations in 2018 relative to the same period last year.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

We remain focused, as I was mentioning at the end of my introduction on capturing opportunities in the midterm. And we are really convinced that there is a tremendous potential that we should be able to unleash in the next few years as we have outlined during our recent investor update in London.
And before starting the Q&A session, I would really like to give a warm welcome to my successor, Ilham Kadri, who, the board recently announced, will become the CEO of the group effective March 1, 2019. She will join us at the beginning of January and spend 2 months with me before taking over as a whole, and I'm confident that many of you will have an opportunity to interact with her in the first few months next year.
And with that, Karim and myself are ready to take your questions. Thank you."

But we don't have any sign that this is degrading. On the specialty -- on the special chem business, we have a small business within special chem, which produces the gases which are used for insulation application, foam blowing, in application of Montreal Protocol. These gases would be phased out over the next few years. We've seen a bit of an acceleration. So nothing overall unexpected, but the situation which degrades a bit faster than we were thinking. And as we are very much all of us are focusing on growth, indeed, this overall small impact is visible, if we look at the performance of the Advanced Materials cluster because special chem is consolidated within the Advanced Materials cluster. Peroxide, frankly speaking, we are very pleased with the current footprint. We are a strong and detached market leader and no reason for us to look for pretty small acquisitions here and there."

Secondly, staying on Advanced Materials, in terms of the mix, it looks like there's been a negative mix effect in the quarter. I'm just wondering if that's because actually the loss in the smart devices margin was slightly higher than the incremental margin from the growth in Composite Materials. Could you help me understand that? And then lastly, on free cash flow, just by my calculations, it looks like versus last year you need to take out about another EUR 50 million of working capital.

So very good performance, top line. To be completely transparent with you, I think we still have some efforts to do to make sure that this top line performance falls into the EBITDA line. And we still see here and there a number of operational hiccups -- operational inefficiency -- opportunities for us to be on the positive side -- opportunities for us to improve the delivery, and we are working very hard on this. We are making sure that the global business unit management team is very much focused -- both is very focused enough, but also on the optimization of the operations and the delivery. So probably longer term, looking at composite, I could expect we would need to achieve our plans -- or we can achieve our plans with a little bit lower level of top line growth, but better delivery. Under mix effect, yes, directionally, you're right. We've lost some sales in the smart devices. Yes, it has been compensated by areas where the margins are slightly less favorable. But frankly speaking, I wouldn't delve too much into these types of detail. Overall, Advanced Materials has the ability midterm to grow very much in line with what we presented in London, and the number of opportunities that we have there is very significant.

I mean, since the beginning of the year, the overall discussion has been working very well, but we just try to get close to the customer and make sure that we can anticipate and manage as effectively as possible with this volatility, but don't -- I mean, when I look at all the markets that we are serving, aerospace has a lot of positive -- I mean, the demand trend is extremely favorable. I mean, we are seeing multi-year growth opportunities in front of us.

So it's pretty small, and it's one of the reason why we have not spent much time discussing the detail a bit. We know that this business is bound to disappear after certain period of time. The question is, really, the rate of decrease. And yes, we've been a bit surprised during the first months of the year by a bit of a steeper rate of decrease. Second element, which is a headwind, is a move from diesel to gasoline because we're producing catalysts. And in terms of margins, the diesel catalysts are a bit better than the gasoline catalysts. And the move from diesel to gasoline has been a little bit faster than expected. Now on the positive side, we have batteries. Also, most of the battery impact today is in Specialty Polymers, but special chem is working on some new advanced solutions regarding batteries. And very interesting market that special chem is now addressing is the electronic market with high-purity H2O2, which is very successful. So when we bring all of these elements together, yes, we see special chem contributing to the growth of the business in the next couple of years.

And the positives, I've some difficulties to catch up. But overall, clearly, opportunities in this business, which is built around our ability to master the fuel chain."

And as usual, we'd like to go through our results, same sequence as usual. I'll make a few introductory comments, turning to Karim for more a detailed presentation and then come back with a few concluding statements, and we'll move into the Q&A session.
I think the -- what we've seen is that volume growth is continuing into Q3, and we get during this quarter also some support of pricing, which leads us for the first 9 months of the year to an organic net sales growth of 6%, driven by volume growth in all 3 segments. Otherwise, you've seen a bit of a differentiation between these 3. Net pricing for the group is 2% higher despite rising raw material costs. This clearly shows the strength of our pricing power and liquidity of our portfolio.
Margins remain quite strong at 22%, which in the European environment is a pretty good level.
Going quickly on what I think are the key business events that are worth considering at the beginning of this call. Volumes sold into the oil and gas market supported our double-digit EBITDA growth in Advanced Formulations for the 9-months period. So clearly, this is a segment which is showing during this first 9 months of 2018 the best performance as far as group is concerned. We saw in oil and gas a bit of stabilization late in Q3. However, demand in other markets, such as agro and coating, showed improvement and contributed to the growth of the segment in the third quarter. So very strong performance and no real worries.
In oil and gas, stabilization is linked to a number of bottleneck that have developed downstream in this very active segment, but the dynamics there is very good.
Very good dynamic also in -- regarding the top line of composite, especially composite used in aircraft, high single-digit growth. Main driver of the military program, the F-35, which is indeed becoming quite successful.
And commercial programs ramp up, mostly at Boeing, where we have the largest exposure, 787 and 737. And we continued to see a very, very good momentum and full order books for many years going forward in these 2 segments, both military program and commercial aircraft. 
Specialty Polymers delivered significant growth, namely in automotive and healthcare application, and this overcame the anticipated reduction in smart devices. We knew, and I think it's probably overall a good thing, that smart devices will be less contributive to our growth this year. When I say it's good it's that, at the end of the day, the objective is to have a very balanced exposure into a number of different markets. And probably, we came a couple of years ago in a situation where smart devices were contributing a little bit too much. So overall, a very good run for our Specialty Polymers business. It's a business which has significant exposure to the automotive industry, and I know that there's a number of headlines these days showing -- demonstrating concerns regarding the performance of the auto sector. Just a few comments there. Polymers sold in the auto remain the contributor of growth, including in the third quarter. We've seen some signs of softness in September and some reduction in our order books, and we are watching development closely. Reasons are very different: a number of regulatory, supply chain issues in Europe; a bit of a softness in the end market in China; and then we've seen people in the supply chain adjusting their level of inventories accordingly. I remind you that in the past few years, we've grown in the auto sector 3x faster than the overall growth of the market because our product are very much part of the transformation of this auto segment. And we are, overall, quite optimistic on the fact that we are very well prepared for any changes, short term or long term, which can happen in the auto market.
Overall, results to date are in line with our expectation, and I'm very confident in our ability to capture many of the significant opportunities for growth across the midterm. We've shared with the market, in London mid-September, our midterm view for the various businesses. And what we see developing since that is there [ is emerging ] support of the comments we've made during this market update.
With that, Karim, can you give us some additional insight into our financial performance?"

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide act",833,"Absolutely. Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Hello, everybody. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide activities. 
I'll start with sales. On Slide 8, you will see that our organic sales increased by 6% over the 9 months, and volumes and mix represented 4% of that growth, the balance related to pricing.
Advanced Formulations. Organic sales up 11%, driven mostly by volume, but also by some price benefits. Now the main drivers of the growth related to this year's recovery in the oil and gas market, especially in the first 7 to 8 months of the year. Jean-Pierre has talked about the stabilization since that period. We've also seen and delivered growth in agro and in coatings. Mining chemicals is growing strongly. We're seeing additional volumes related to new mine openings, indeed. And only by way of example, we secured new copper business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Kazakhstan and in South Africa. We also benefited from demand growth from cobalt refineries in Turkey and in China. 
Advanced Materials. Sales grew 4% organically, as Jean-Pierre indicated, driven by the automotive market, where the trend for fuel-efficient vehicles is continuing to support the greater use of our polymer technology across a multitude of platforms, from hybrids, electric vehicles, et cetera.
Volume growth was also driven by higher composite sales to aeronautics and, indeed, we're seeing high single-digit growth in that domain. Now that's what generated most of the growth, although we also saw some positive contributions and good growth in healthcare, where polymer use is increasing across a number of different medical applications. But we also had a few headwinds in some of the smaller markets. Jean-Pierre has talked about the substantial decline in sales of the smart devices -- device market relative to last year, and we've experienced a reduction in sales in insulation  blowing agents as well as in catalysts that are used in diesel fuels.
Performance Chemicals. Strong growth. Organic sales up 6% nearly, 4% of that related to pricing, 2% volumes. The increase was attributed to both peroxide and soda ash, where we're benefiting from a robust demand environment, strong momentum there, and our soda ash plants are operating at very high levels. 
Our Coatis business also contributed to the sales growth, thanks to improved domestic demand in the Latin American region.
So all in all, good top line organic growth year-to-date. But, of course, we can't defy gravity, and scope and foreign exchange in fact restricted the underlying sales growth to 0.5%. 
Turning to EBITDA on Slide 9. You will have noticed the 6% organic growth in the 9-month period, although again, scope and foreign exchange meant that EBITDA is down 0.7%. The organic growth of 6% reflects the impact of the strong volume growth that I've referred to just now, and that alone had a 7% positive impact on our EBITDA evolution.
We've also had good pricing dynamics across many of our businesses and that helped to overcome the higher energy and raw material costs.
I wish to highlight an increase in fixed costs, and that predominantly reflects the capability that we're building to support our growth. For example, in the composite business, we're also investing in some initiatives that are focused on improving our productivity, on driving even more operating efficiencies as we prepare for the continued volume growth that we see ahead of us.
If I turn to net income on Slide 10, you will notice that the net income -- our net income from continuing businesses is up 10%, and that is despite the 0.7% reduction in reported underlying EBITDA. Why is it? Quite simple. It reflects the benefits related to the ongoing decrease in financial charges as we deleverage and also a reduction in our underlying tax rate, which is now 25%, 2% better than last year. These positive developments supported EPS growth, earnings per share growth from our continuing operations, like-for-like, with an increase of 11% in EPS, and that is despite scope and foreign exchange impact.
Cash is and will always remain high on the agenda. I'm now turning to Slide 11.
Free cash flow from continuing operations at EUR 275 million through the 9 months is down on last year, predominantly as we've built higher working capital. We've built inventory, in particular, in order to meet increased demand from our customers, but also ahead of planned regular maintenance shutdowns.
As I look at free cash flow to shareholders, which I'll remind you is after financial charges, they increased 7% to EUR 271 million in the first 9 months. Now this reflects the profit and reduction in financial charges I've alluded to, but more importantly, continued strong performance and high cash generation from our discontinued operations in 2018 relative to the same period last year.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

I think this presentation shows that our results are, indeed, in line with the expectation we set for this year. Priorities for us are very clear. Under the current market circumstances -- and by the way, we've not seen any real change in the first weeks of the last quarter. We expect organic EBITDA growth around 5% to 6%, within the range provided at the start of the year. We also confirm that we'll convert that performance into strong free cash flow generation.
We know that the macro-economic and political climate are often bringing some uncertainties. We cannot control those variables, obviously, so we are focusing on what's in our control, including focus on innovation and customers and delivering growth and cash.
We remain focused, as I was mentioning at the end of my introduction, on capturing opportunities in the midterm. And we are really convinced that there is a tremendous potential that we should be able to unleash in the next few years, as we have outlined during our recent investor update in London.
And before starting the Q&A session, I would really like to give a warm welcome to my successor, Ilham Kadri, who the board recently announced will become the CEO of the group effective March 1, 2019.

But we don't have any sign that this is degrading. On the specialty -- on the special chem business, we have a small business within special chem, which produces the gases which are used for insulation application, foam blowing. In application of the Montreal Protocol, these gases would be phased out over the next few years. We've seen a bit of an acceleration. So nothing overall unexpected, but the situation which degrades a bit faster than we were thinking. And as we are very much, all of us, are focusing on growth, indeed, this overall small impact is visible if we look at the performance of the Advanced Materials cluster because special chem is consolidated within the Advanced Materials cluster.

On composite, the -- we've seen, indeed, pretty strong top line growth, very much what we were expecting, and we are -- we're very well positioned on programs which are at an inflection point and moving towards very significant growth, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35 and, more broadly speaking, some of the Boeing new aircraft. So very good performance, top line. To be completely transparent with you, I think we still have some efforts to do to make sure that this top line performance falls into the EBITDA line. And we still see here and there a number of operational hiccups, operational inefficiency opportunities for us to be on the positive side, opportunities for us to improve the delivery, and we are working very hard on this. We are making sure that the global business unit and management team is very much focused, both is very focused on that, but also on the optimization of the operations and the delivery. So probably longer term, looking at composite, I could expect what we would need to achieve our plans -- or we can achieve our plans with a little bit lower level of top line growth, but better delivery. On the mix effect, yes, directionally, you're right. We've lost some sales in the smart devices. Yes, it has been compensated by areas where the margins are slightly less favorable. But frankly speaking, I wouldn't delve too much into these types of detail. Overall, Advanced Materials has the ability midterm to grow very much in line with what we presented in London, and the number of opportunities that we have there is very significant. And clearly, it's a business which has no margin issues. We are at a level of margins where, indeed -- which, indeed, puts these businesses into a value-creation mode and are very high in terms of return on capital.

And we're in a position to rebalance in a way which I think is, overall, positive our exposure to various markets. So I don't have any worries regarding our ability to load that plant or this plant at a level which guarantee a good level of performance. But on composite, there is no magic wand. I mean, yes, there are sometimes volatility in the management of the supply chain that we see in aerospace, although it has not been a factor in the past months. I mean, since the beginning of the year, the overall situation has been working very well, but we just try to get close to the customer and make sure that we can anticipate and manage as effectively as possible with this volatility. But don't -- I mean, when I look at all the markets that we are serving, aerospace has a lot of positive. I mean, the demand trend is extremely favorable. I mean, we are seeing multi-year growth opportunities in front of us. We have very long qualification time, which is an issue when you are not qualified, but which becomes a strong protection once you are qualified. Close relationship with the customer. So overall, that's really a market where we have significant opportunities in front of us and behavior which is pretty good."

Yes, F-35, LEAP engine, these programs are at a point when they are starting to reach their growth rate, which are very significant. 737 is also in such a situation, plus a few military program.

The stabilization of the market is mostly linked to some difficulties for people to ship the oil that they are producing, and there's a number of pipe issues in the U.S., which creates a bottleneck I was mentioning. So yes, people are working hard to solve this situation. But I think, again, that we are well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be positive development next year. The only point I would probably underline is the fact that on the friction reducer side, we've been very successful with our innovation.

So we see a couple of areas where we are facing headwinds. The first one is, obviously, the insulation business. Again, it's a few tens of millions in terms of sales. So it's pretty small, and it's one of the reason why we have not spent much time discussing the detail a bit. We know that this business is bound to disappear after a certain period of time. The question is, really, the rate of decrease. And yes, we've been a bit surprised during the first months of the year by a bit of a steeper rate of decrease. Second element, which is a headwind, is the move from diesel to gasoline because we're producing catalysts. And in terms of margins, the diesel catalysts are a bit better than the gasoline catalysts. And the move from diesel to gasoline has been a little bit faster than expected. Now on the positive side, we have batteries. So most of the battery impact today is in Specialty Polymers, but special chem is working on some new advanced solutions regarding batteries. And a very interesting market that special chem is now addressing is the electronic market with high-purity H2O2, which is very successful. So when we bring all of these elements together, yes, we see special chem contributing to the growth of the business in the next couple of years. We are just, as we speak, in a situation in 2018 where the negatives were a little bit more significant than we thought or faster than we thought, by the way, in both cases, insulation and diesel. And the positives have had some difficulties to catch up. But overall, clearly, opportunities in this business, which is built around our ability to master the fuel chain."

And as usual, we'd like to go through our results, same sequence as usual. I'll make a few introductory comments, turning to Karim for more a detailed presentation and then come back with a few concluding statements, and we'll move into the Q&A session.
I think the -- what we've seen is that volume growth is continuing into Q3, and we get during this quarter also some support of pricing, which leads us for the first 9 months of the year to an organic net sales growth of 6%, driven by volume growth in all 3 segments. Otherwise, you've seen a bit of a differentiation between these 3. Net pricing for the group is 2% higher despite rising raw material costs. This clearly shows the strength of our pricing power and liquidity of our portfolio.
Margins remain quite strong at 22%, which in the European environment is a pretty good level.
Going quickly on what I think are the key business events that are worth considering at the beginning of this call. Volumes sold into the oil and gas market supported our double-digit EBITDA growth in Advanced Formulations for the 9-months period. So clearly, this is a segment which is showing during this first 9 months of 2018 the best performance as far as group is concerned. We saw in oil and gas a bit of stabilization late in Q3. However, demand in other markets, such as agro and coating, showed improvement and contributed to the growth of the segment in the third quarter. So very strong performance and no real worries.
In oil and gas, stabilization is linked to a number of bottleneck that have developed downstream in this very active segment, but the dynamics there is very good.
Very good dynamic also in -- regarding the top line of composite, especially composite used in aircraft, high single-digit growth. Main driver of the military program, the F-35, which is indeed becoming quite successful.
And commercial programs ramp up, mostly at Boeing, where we have the largest exposure, 787 and 737. And we continued to see a very, very good momentum and full order books for many years going forward in these 2 segments, both military program and commercial aircraft. 
Specialty Polymers delivered significant growth, namely in automotive and health care application, and this overcame the anticipated reduction in smart devices. We knew, and I think it's probably overall a good thing, that smart devices will be less contributive to our growth this year. When I say it's good it's that, at the end of the day, the objective is to have a very balanced exposure into a number of different markets. And probably, we came a couple of years ago in a situation where smart devices were contributing a little bit too much. So overall, a very good run for our Specialty Polymers business. It's a business which has significant exposure to the automotive industry, and I know that there's a number of headlines these days showing -- demonstrating concerns regarding the performance of the auto sector. Just a few comments there. Polymers sold in the auto remain the contributor of growth, including in the third quarter. We've seen some signs of softness in September and some reduction in our order books, and we are watching development closely. Reasons are very different: a number of regulatory, supply chain issues in Europe; a bit of a softness in the end market in China; and then we've seen people in the supply chain adjusting their level of inventories accordingly. I remind you that in the past few years, we've grown in the auto sector 3x faster than the overall growth of the market because our product are very much part of the transformation of this auto segment. And we are, overall, quite optimistic on the fact that we are very well prepared for any changes, short term or long term, which can happen in the auto market.
Overall, results to date are in line with our expectation, and I'm very confident in our ability to capture many of the significant opportunities for growth across the midterm. We've shared with the market, in London mid-September, our midterm view for the various businesses. And what we see developing since that is there [ is emerging ] support of the comments we've made during this market update.
With that, Karim, can you give us some additional insight into our financial performance?"

As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide act",833,"Absolutely. Thanks, Jean-Pierre. Hello, everybody. As usual, I'm going to refer to slides that you can access on our website. And results I'm going to refer to are, of course, on an underlying basis, and they reflect a discontinuation of the Polyamide activities. 
I'll start with sales. On Slide 8, you will see that our organic sales increased by 6% over the 9 months, and volumes and mix represented 4% of that growth, the balance related to pricing.
Advanced Formulations. Organic sales up 11%, driven mostly by volume, but also by some price benefits. Now the main drivers of the growth related to this year's recovery in the oil and gas market, especially in the first 7 to 8 months of the year. Jean-Pierre has talked about the stabilization since that period. We've also seen and delivered growth in agro and in coatings. Mining chemicals is growing strongly. We're seeing additional volumes related to new mine openings, indeed. And only by way of example, we secured new copper business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Kazakhstan and in South Africa. We also benefited from demand growth from cobalt refineries in Turkey and in China. 
Advanced Materials. Sales grew 4% organically, as Jean-Pierre indicated, driven by the automotive market, where the trend for fuel-efficient vehicles is continuing to support the greater use of our polymer technology across a multitude of platforms, from hybrids, electric vehicles, et cetera.
Volume growth was also driven by higher composite sales to aeronautics and, indeed, we're seeing high single-digit growth in that domain. Now that's what generated most of the growth, although we also saw some positive contributions and good growth in healthcare, where polymer use is increasing across a number of different medical applications. But we also had a few headwinds in some of the smaller markets. Jean-Pierre has talked about the substantial decline in sales of the smart devices -- device market relative to last year, and we've experienced a reduction in sales in insulation blowing agents as well as in catalysts that are used in diesel fuels.
Performance Chemicals. Strong growth. Organic sales up 6% nearly, 4% of that related to pricing, 2% volumes. The increase was attributed to both peroxide and soda ash, where we're benefiting from a robust demand environment, strong momentum there, and our soda ash plants are operating at very high levels. 
Our Coatis business also contributed to the sales growth, thanks to improved domestic demand in the Latin American region.
So all in all, good top line organic growth year-to-date. But of course, we can't defy gravity, and scope and foreign exchange in fact restricted the underlying sales growth to 0.5%. 
Turning to EBITDA on Slide 9. You will have noticed the 6% organic growth in the 9-month period, although again, scope and foreign exchange meant that EBITDA is down 0.7%. The organic growth of 6% reflects the impact of the strong volume growth that I've referred to just now, and that alone had a 7% positive impact on our EBITDA evolution.
We've also had good pricing dynamics across many of our businesses and that helped to overcome the higher energy and raw material costs.
I wish to highlight an increase in fixed costs, and that predominantly reflects the capability that we're building to support our growth. For example, in the composite business, we're also investing in some initiatives that are focused on improving our productivity, on driving even more operating efficiencies as we prepare for the continued volume growth that we see ahead of us.
If I turn to net income on Slide 10, you will notice that the net income -- our net income from continuing businesses is up 10%, and that is despite the 0.7% reduction in reported underlying EBITDA. Why is it? Quite simple. It reflects the benefits related to the ongoing decrease in financial charges as we deleverage and also a reduction in our underlying tax rate, which is now 25%, 2% better than last year. These positive developments supported EPS growth, earnings per share growth from our continuing operations, like-for-like, with an increase of 11% in EPS, and that is despite scope and foreign exchange impact.
Cash is and will always remain high on the agenda. I'm now turning to Slide 11.
Free cash flow from continuing operations at EUR 275 million through the 9 months is down on last year, predominantly as we've built higher working capital. We've built inventory, in particular, in order to meet increased demand from our customers, but also ahead of planned regular maintenance shutdowns.
As I look at free cash flow to shareholders, which I'll remind you is after financial charges, they increased 7% to EUR 271 million in the first 9 months. Now this reflects the profit and reduction in financial charges I've alluded to, but more importantly, continued strong performance and high cash generation from our discontinued operations in 2018 relative to the same period last year.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

I think this presentation shows that our results are, indeed, in line with the expectation we set for this year. Priorities for us are very clear.

So on the automotive market, what I was implying is that we've seen in September some impact or some softness in our order book. And we've seen then the trend stabilizing. So no further degradation, but the -- really is something which happened at the end of September. You know that it's mostly linked to a couple of different events, disruption in the supply chain in Europe, links mostly but not only to regulatory issues and then some actual softness in the Chinese market. But we don't have any sign that this is degrading. On the specialty -- on the special chem business, we have a small business within special chem, which produces the gases which are used for insulation application, foam blowing. In application of the Montreal Protocol, these gases would be phased out over the next few years. We've seen a bit of an acceleration. So nothing overall unexpected, but the situation which degrades a bit faster than we were thinking. And as we are very much, all of us, are focusing on growth, indeed, this overall small impact is visible if we look at the performance of the Advanced Materials cluster because special chem is consolidated within the Advanced Materials cluster. Peroxide, frankly speaking, we are very pleased with the current footprint. We are a strong and [ detached ] market leader and no reason for us to look for pretty small acquisitions here and there."

Or is, actually, that running now a bit higher than the required contribution from that business? Secondly, staying on Advanced Materials, in terms of the mix, it looks like there's been a negative mix effect in the quarter. I'm just wondering if that's because actually the loss in the smart devices margin was slightly higher than the incremental margin from the growth in Composite Materials. Could you help me understand that? And then lastly, on free cash flow, just by my calculations, it looks like versus last year you need to take out about another EUR 50 million of working capital. Actually, does the slowdown in some of the end markets help you with that working capital kind of unwind? And has your conviction there kind of increased or decreased through the quarter?"

On composite, the -- we've seen, indeed, pretty strong top line growth, very much what we were expecting, and we are -- we're very well positioned on programs which are at an inflection point and moving towards very significant growth, both on the LEAP engine and the F-35 and, more broadly speaking, some of the Boeing new aircraft. So very good performance, top line. To be completely transparent with you, I think we still have some efforts to do to make sure that this top line performance falls into the EBITDA line. And we still see here and there a number of operational hiccups, operational inefficiency opportunities for us to be on the positive side, opportunities for us to improve the delivery, and we are working very hard on this. We are making sure that the global business unit and management team is very much focused, both is very focused on that, but also on the optimization of the operations and the delivery. So probably longer term, looking at composite, I could expect what we would need to achieve our plans -- or we can achieve our plans with a little bit lower level of top line growth, but better delivery. On the mix effect, yes, directionally, you're right. We've lost some sales in the smart devices. Yes, it has been compensated by areas where the margins are slightly less favorable. But frankly speaking, I wouldn't delve too much into these types of detail. Overall, Advanced Materials has the ability midterm to grow very much in line with what we presented in London, and the number of opportunities that we have there is very significant. And clearly, it's a business which has no margin issues. We are at a level of margins where, indeed -- which, indeed, puts these businesses into a value-creation mode and are very high in terms of return on capital.

How do you sort of go about protecting the composite business in that? And then on Specialty Polymers, you obviously have the PEEK plant within U.S. I just wondered if you could comment on how full that plant is, where you are in capacity utilization.

So I don't have any worries regarding our ability to load that plant or this plant at a level which guarantee a good level of performance. But on composite, there is no magic wand. I mean, yes, there are sometimes volatility in the management of the supply chain that we see in aerospace, although it has not been a factor in the past months. I mean, since the beginning of the year, the overall situation has been working very well, but we just try to get close to the customer and make sure that we can anticipate and manage as effectively as possible with this volatility. But don't -- I mean, when I look at all the markets that we are serving, aerospace has a lot of positive. I mean, the demand trend is extremely favorable. I mean, we are seeing multi-year growth opportunities in front of us. We have very long qualification time, which is an issue when you are not qualified, but which becomes a strong protection once you are qualified. Close relationship with the customer.

So we see a couple of areas where we are facing headwinds. The first one is, obviously, the insulation business. Again, it's a few tens of millions in terms of sales. So it's pretty small, and it's one of the reason why we have not spent much time discussing the detail a bit. We know that this business is bound to disappear after a certain period of time. The question is, really, the rate of decrease. And yes, we've been a bit surprised during the first months of the year by a bit of a steeper rate of decrease. Second element, which is a headwind, is the move from diesel to gasoline because we're producing catalysts. And in terms of margins, the diesel catalysts are a bit better than the gasoline catalysts. And the move from diesel to gasoline has been a little bit faster than expected. Now on the positive side, we have batteries. So most of the battery impact today is in Specialty Polymers, but special chem is working on some new advanced solutions regarding batteries. And a very interesting market that special chem is now addressing is the electronic market with high-purity H2O2, which is very successful. So when we bring all of these elements together, yes, we see special chem contributing to the growth of the business in the next couple of years. We are just, as we speak, in a situation in 2018 where the negatives were a little bit more significant than we thought or faster than we thought, by the way, in both cases, insulation and diesel.
