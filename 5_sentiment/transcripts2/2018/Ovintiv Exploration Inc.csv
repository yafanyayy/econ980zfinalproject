By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX publication. We provided a very detailed outlook for you, and we will reference many of these materials on this morning's call.
Before jumping into 2018 and our 3-year outlook, let me cover a few significant highlights from 2017. 2017 was another solid performance year for our company. In STACK, we executed an aggressive infill drilling program last year and rapidly advanced our understanding of how to best space and complete our pad developments to optimize returns. 
With [indiscernible] requirements largely behind us, we're in a position to be able to maximize value creation, and our plan today is returns-focused. You will see in today's @NFX that we estimate our average STACK well in the 3-year plan will generate about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and have an average well cost of around $7.9 million. This is a function of our planned construct. Well costs will vary from $7.5 million to $9 million depending on where the wells are located across our acreage, EUR flexes with well costs as well. We provide estimated EUR ranges of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent for these wells. When factoring in the differences in well costs and oil cuts across our geographic mix, our rate of return estimates are high and average greater than 50% in the 3-year plan.
We've learned a great deal about well spacing and optimizing completions. On Page 14 in @NFX, we provide a long-dated well performance from our annuity 80 infill wells drilled to date. Note that this comparison includes all wells in which we own an interest, not selected disclosure of our operated wells where we control the spacing and completion designs. 
We have proven relatively consistent well performance against the 1.3 million-barrel oil equivalent type curve and operated pads like Stark, Freeman, Dorothy, Jackson and nonoperated pads like Keith and Ludwig have provided valuable insights, and as a result, we have confidence in high-return developments across the entirety of our acreage. 
We moved early and aggressively to test various spacing configurations to ensure we have the proper science to build long-term value for our owners and development. Our infill tests to date range from 3 wells in a single layer of the Meramec to 12 wells in the full Meramec DSU development. We have drilled spacing tests from west to east. This takes you from the deeper, more pressured gassy regions all the way through the phase envelope and into the far Eastern outer core, the black oil. 
We're applying lots of historical lessons from our original development plans in SCOOP. Early on, in SCOOP, when spaced wells at only 5 to 6 wells per section. Today, we are actively developing SCOOP with 8 to 10 wells per DSU. We are matching the proper science and data with the specific attributes of the rock and tailoring our development plans to maximize well performance, returns and value creation. 
We issued some exciting new results in our SCORE program today as well. Recall that last year, we embarked on resource expansion program to unlock additional producing horizons on our existing acreage in the Anadarko Basin. I'll talk more about SCORE in a moment. 
In the Williston, we continue to drill the best oil wells in the business with larger completions and tighter spacing. We have achieved strong economics both on and off Anticline and are now testing 8 to 9 wells per DSU in our recent developments. 2017, we raised our type curve to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent to reflect recent well performance. As a result of improved well performance in all areas, management of our base production and careful attention to costs, we delivered 10% year-over-year production growth in 2017. More importantly, we maintained a sizable cash balance throughout the year. This cash on hand will be used to balance the near-term differences between our cash flow from operations and our capital investments. 
Proved reserves increased 33% year-over-year, and we replaced 390% of our production with new additions. At year-end 2017, SCOOP and STACK accounted for about 70% of our total proved reserves.
We continue down our path of gaining efficiencies, lowering F&D costs and improving our operating margins. Since 2014, we've improved our cost structure, largely to the growing scale of our Anadarko Basin operations and an intense focus on cost control to expand our margins. These seemingly ordinary steps our team takes each day to do things faster, smarter and safer are now translating to the bottom line. 
Our 3-year outlook is well documented in @NFX, so let me provide some additional commentary around the highlights.
Our 2018 capital budget is approximately $1.3 billion, with 80% of our drilling completed investments allocated to our growth engines in the Anadarko Basin. At $55 per barrel of oil and $2.85 for MMbtu of gas, we expect that our investment levels and CapEx will align in the second half of this year. 
Looking into 2019 and 2020 at the same price assumptions, we expect to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow, and at $60 per barrel of oil, the free cash flow estimate climbs to $1 billion. We have worked hard to transition our company to be able to deliver double-digit growth within cash flow and improve our debt-adjusted metrics. 
Our 3-year plan projects annualized domestic production growth of 14% to 18%, domestic crude oil growth of 17% to 21%, and on a debt-adjusted basis, production is expected to grow 15% to 20%, and cash flows expected to grow 20% to 30%. 
Our plan is returns focused. Yesterday, we received a number of questions around our oil growth trajectory in late 2018. Although the year-over-year growth is up, an impressive 20% at the midpoint, our commodity mix changes slightly in the fourth quarter. If we're going to manage our business for returns on the road ahead, we must also learn to be more commodity agnostic. We have some high-rate pads that are scheduled to pop in the second half of 2018, largely due to drilling schedules from HBP requirements. Because of their geographic location in Western STACK and SCOOP wet gas, natural gas content on these pads will be higher, but please note that the rates of returns are outstanding. 
In today's @NFX, we provided an unprecedented level of transparency in how our 3-year plan was constructed. We've clearly articulated our deliverables, and on the road ahead, we hope this conversation with analysts will shift from simply growth to a more stringent focus on returns. We heard this mandate from our investors, and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors. 
In addition, our 3-year plan was also designed to deliver steady-to-improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the plan period with no additional borrowings. As I mentioned, we work with our Compensation Committee to amend our annual incentive pay metrics for 2018 to include debt-adjusted production growth and cash flow per share metrics, a cash-on-cash return metric and a heightened focus on corporate responsibility. There's a slide in @NFX that provides you with details. 
I'll turn it over to Larry now to cover the fourth quarter financial results."

Today, we entered 2018 financially strong and are excited about our forward outlook. Due to fortunate timing on previous asset sales, lucrative hedging positions and quick adjustment we made to our investment levels, we were able to weather a very tough period in our business and emerge stronger. The foundation we have created has allowed us to develop the 3-year plan you see today. Let me quickly cover the 2017 financial highlights.
For the fourth quarter, both our earnings and cash flows again came in above Street estimates, and our production was right down the fairway for our most recent guidance. After adjusting for the items mentioned in our news release around refundable tax credits and unrealized derivative losses, our net income for the quarter was $143 million or $0.71 per share. For the full year, after adjusting for those items, net income was $432 million, or $2.15 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Consolidated net production was 57.3 million BOE, up 10% year-over-year when adjusted for asset sales. 
Recall in early 2017, we used what appeared to be, at that time, a conservative oil price of $50 WTI. It turned out the $50 was the right number. As we improved our cost structure and achieved better well performance throughout 2017, we were able to close out the year with a deficit of about $200 million funded by cash on the balance sheet. This excludes acquisitions and divestitures during the year, which largely offset one another. 
Over the last several years, we have maintained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth with allow us to further delever. This could trigger credit rating upgrade in the period as we grow into potential higher credit rating, which should allow us access to a capital at premier rates due to the inevitable cycle in our business.
We are approaching 2018 with a very similar strategic mindset. Our budget is based on $55 WTI, and we have run plan sensitivities below above and below that assumption. With the significant portion of our 2018 production hedged in the mid-50s, we have insulated ourselves fairly well against downside risk. Likewise, if prices remain above $60, I doubt you will see us significantly change our operating plans. Our 3-year plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth in production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics in an environment that we consider to be mid-cycle oil pricing. 
As you can see in @NFX, we are forecasting significant free cash flow in the 3-year plan at a budget price of $55 oil and quite a bit more at $60 oil. The use of any free cash flow will all depend on the needs of the organization at the time. Like most companies, we will prioritize between reinvestment and acceleration of activity versus a return of cash to investor via debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. The latter, of course, can be catalyzed with the sale of any significant noncore assets.
We will consider all options. As I told Lee, let's get -- let's just get to free cash flow first, then lets assess the road ahead and consider the financial needs of the company. Rest assured, you can count on us to make the right decisions for the owners. 
With that, I'll hand the mic back to Lee."

In the Anadarko Basin, we expect to drill nearly 550 wells through the course of our 3-year plan. Our program will be predominantly pad focused, and operational efficiencies will allow for more wells placed on production per rig. 
2018, about 2/3 of Anadarko Basin wells will be in STACK. Anadarko Basin net production is expected to grow from our 2017 average of just under 100,000 BOE per day to an average of approximately 185,000 BOE per day in 2020. 
Late 2017, we began producing from the Velta June, the most technically advanced Meramec development to date. The Velta June was a collaborative effort by Newfield and our partners to test 12 well spacing in the Meramec formation alone. We drilled 4 3-well pads and focused on targeting, stage and cluster spacing optimization, various proppant loadings, proprietary techniques to optimize the volume of rock stimulating. Although early, flowback is encouraging and in line with expectations. This is a project that we will model and learn from for months to come.
Let me get off script for a moment and address the reaction on our stock price last year after a competitor in the basin referenced its far Eastern STACK results. As the Founder of STACK, we understand the play and have more data than anyone today, especially in the black oil window. We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance. Our Eastern acreage or the outer core of our position constitutes about 10% to 15% of our total STACK acreage position, and our leases were acquired 5 to 7 years ago at well under $1,000 an acre. There are reasons we have elected the past on previous acquisitions from private operators that may have had different objectives altogether when the drilled wells and identified sweet spots, pumped large completions and touted IP results. We have had a very careful and methodical approach to our HBP drilling. Recall that from the beginning, we referenced the importance of how wells against the section boundaries to preserve the best development options for the future. Behaviors are different when you want to own and develop an asset over a decade or more. 
Others may have challenged economics going forward, but we are confident there is a lot of oil out there to develop at very strong returns. With the depth and quality of our inventory and so much time ahead of us to develop our Eastern acreage, it may be several years before we attack this area in STACK. We're running a marathon, not a sprint. And we have the time and the team to get it right. Now back to my script.
In @NFX today, we specifically called out the recent Jackson/Florene infill and the Eastern black oil window, which tested 4 wells of a single Meramec layer. Take a look at the drawing. The original parent wells were in the Woodford, and we recently came back to test the lower Meramec. We estimate that the Meramec infills had an IRR of approximately 90%. 
In 2018, we will follow up on our Jackson black oil development in the eastern STACK with several new pilots to test up to 6 to 8 total wells with results expected before year-end. 
Our Stark development located in the [indiscernible] oil window tested 10 wells in the Meramec and is one of the best return projects to date. After 9 months online, we're estimating 100% IRR.
As we said before, it's very early. To date, we have 8 operated DSUs where we have drilled infill wells. That's 8 out of about 300 total STACK DSUs we intend to develop over time. We are learning with each new pad and rapidly applying those learnings to deliver stronger returns. 
Let me stay in the Anadarko Basin but switch gears and talk a little bit about SCORE, where we invested in resource expansion program to test the Sycamore, Caney and Osage formations. In addition, we tested an exciting Northwest expansion of our STACK program in the Meramec and continue to extend our SCOOP oil play to the north and east. 
On Page 17 in today's @NFX, we have detailed map and highlights recent score activity by Newfield and industry. Within our 3-year outlook, we plan to invest about $350 million to drill around 80 wells in these play types. In the North SCOOP, an area where we and industry have recently been more active, results in the oil window have been highly encouraging and set us up for additional development opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Our recent Larry well was very strong with an IP30 of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Yesterday, we also released results from our Northwest STACK extension highlighting an area where the Meramec shale extends. Results are consistent and mimic what we have seen in the heart of STACK. We have an active HBP program planned for this area in 2018. 
With a single rig program, we expect another year of growth in the Williston Basin where our teams are delivering best-in-class well performance in both cost and productivity. Williston is expected to deliver $90 million to $100 million of free cash flow for us in 2018. Last year, we raised our type curve in the Williston, and today's wells of estimated gross EUR of about 1 million barrels.
Lastly, the Uinta, an area that we have not mentioned in a few years, saw the return of some very prolific oil wells in the Central Basin. The team has done a great job of radically changing operations to cut well costs and improve well productivity and returns. This warrants $130 million that we are allocating in 2018 to HBP this valuable asset for optionality in the future. Over the last 2 years, we quietly executed a JV program that allowed us to test additional horizons, new drilling concepts and proved targeting and tailored completion designs. The results can be found in @NFX. We're extremely encouraged by the reduction in well costs and enhanced productivity from our wells. 
So why is this significant? We have more than 225,000 net acres in that Uinta with nearly half located in the Central Basin region where industry has been posting some very strong results. The oil content in these wells is 80% to 90%. The basin is thick and overpressured with more than 4,000 feet of STACK [indiscernible]. The same [indiscernible] that has worked so well for us in the Anadarko Basin also exists in the Uinta.
Before closing out to take your specific questions, let me summarize why we think this plan is a great value proposition for our stockholders. Our 3-year outlook is a strategic recipe to get the most out of our asset base today with targeting investments and high-return drilling programs to rapidly grow our cash flow. This plan moves us to a company that can sustainably grow double-digit within cash flow from operations. We have high confidence in our ability to deliver this plan. Over the last several years, we have significantly derisked our asset base and improved well productivity across the company, all the while strengthening our balance sheet. We have firm footing from which to execute on the road ahead. 
I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses. And as always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

I think I've told you in years past, we've got an embedded grow, hold, divest mentality that lives inside our organization. It's alive and well. We invested in a JV program there over the previous 2 years. The team took learnings that we have from other areas of activity in Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin notably. Went to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper and the challenge to drive costs down to get the project where it could be competitive within our portfolio. To give you a feel for how far they've driven costs down, we suffered through a couple of years, 2, 3 years early on in the play, when a lot of folks were still trying to tell whether it's a vertical play. We suffered through the early learnings on driving this play to its ultimate places of horizontal resource play. The suffering was that the well cost back in that time period was substantially above $10 million a piece. I would say, mid to -- mid-teens would be a more normal occurrence back then. Over the course of the last few years, our team's quickly driven the costs down below $10 million. And we presently sit in around where we drill and complete the wells that you see on that sheet of paper for around $7 million or less. So pretty dramatic improvement. It does move the play where it's generating competitive returns, but we'll have more to say about the Uinta on the road ahead. But very significant progress that's been made, large resource, and we're going to continue to work to drive value out of that basin."

Last year, we used 50. We did the same thing. 50 was a pretty good call. We're basing this at 55. I think the way I would think about it is you can see what the plan throws off when it gets 60 and above, throwing off a lot of cash. We're well hedged in the short term, so it comes down to how does the commodity move 2018, '19 and '20. So we're well protected to the downside in '18, which means that if prices were to fall lower, we don't have to adjust our plan materially in 2018. We'll keep our eyes open for signals from the market on what the right pace of activity is as the '19 and '20 pricing develops a little bit of clarity. I think you well know that the curves are backward dated today, and we're going to be judicious in terms of how we think about building our hedge book over time. But I think we're in good shape, and $5 move in oil prices, 2018 to the upsides, another $80 million to $100 million cash flows is a way to think about it.

I think we and the industry, there's a lot of other wells on that sheet that are drilled by other companies. I think it proved back and spaced, so I think all of the 3 intervals that we eliminated, the Sycamore, Caney and the Osage, that drilling activity, that resource has been substantively derisked like how the wells are dispersed around our acreage footprint, that gives you as an investor confidence in that resource. The challenge then becomes the learnings as we go through these multiwell DSU developments with a focus on returns and the challenges for John Jasek and the teams on the operating front are going to be how to fetter in additional work there and continue to work to progress those horizons so that we get the right projects at the front of the line. That's where we're going to be focused. And if it turned out that the right project on the front of the line as a Sycamore well, you'll hear us talking about Sycamore. We also mentioned the extensional work that was done, which I think is substantial North SCOOP, an area where EOG is coming and drilled some wells as well. It's another new entrant. And we where we announced the 2,000-barrel a day, 30-day rate on the Larry well, I think it's evidence of that. I think our teams have been patient. But we are focused on working really, really hard. Let's call it sense of surge urgency to do the right things right and give the answers early because it's important to get it early so that you get it right early. And that's one of the big challenges for the team. So we'll continue to juggle those investments. We're investing in some 80 wells and those horizons that were derisked with the 2017 program in the 3-year plan. And it will be my expectation that you'll see a shift over time to various parts of that portfolio depending upon returns, commodity mix, macro, all the things that we use to judge where we want to be drilling. But we're very pleased with what we've seen from the SCORE program. And I think it gives us a good visibility on the integrity of the section that we need to be planning to develop, and we clearly achieved the objective expanding the resource. I think we got 3 billion barrels plus now in the Anadarko Basin alone."

Generally, we drilled 10,000-foot laterals everywhere we could. We drilled those laterals on opposite sides of the lease line to keep those wells close. That was coming in the early stages of kind of getting some indications what interference might look like overtime. The other thing it did for us is it locked virtually $2 million -- not $2 million -- excuse me, 2 miles of undisturbed ground between that well and the next well that we drilled to HBP, the offsetting some extra. And we marched through the acreage in that way because we knew that we didn't know the answer. We knew we had the acreage in the HBP, we didn't know the answer to what the absolute final development spacing might be. We talked a lot about the last couple of years about the macro, prevailing commodity prices being part of the equation. We've talked about this being a 3-dimensional geometry problem that the team is working on. There's probably got a lot more to mentioned that when you think about completion mix and intensity and all the other things we're testing as well. But clearly, I think, we'll have the bias for developing to the fullest extent we can the economically viable section of rock that we see in particular DSU. And that's going to vary from location to location. We've got some ideas and, we've actually had some tests that we'll probably talk about during the course of this year that John and our team call interface tests. That's where we're drilling interface between Osage and Woodford. And we've had some interesting and encouraging results there. But that's all the setup. That development is being part of the ultimate development cube. So I think there's a lot going on there, and we have some test planned in '18 that'll help us advance that ball in 2018."

We can certainly nod our heads when we see that. But we don't believe that the biggest job size is necessarily the right solution in development where you have to deal with other issues of drainage, interference, optimal vertical and lateral offset spacing.

I understand all of that stuff and I know that splashy IPs are splashy IPs and. Sometimes, they don't really tell you what's ahead. Our team has done a lot of good work moving back to STACK. I think we've done  similar work in the Williston Basin as well, but the Stark pad that was mentioned, yes, earlier, several times during the course of last year. One of the really cool things they did there is they didn't maximize the early production rates out of those wells. Now we are telling about 100% return out of the 10 well-known DSU in the Meramec. Pretty exciting stuff. If you look at some of the early wells that were drilled around that area, and it'd be easier for you guys to find, you'll see some really high splashy IP rates. But you also saw some very high decline rates with those. So in places you have big IP rates and steep decline rates, the reservoir engineers are probably going to get more nervous overall and  wonder if they are doing more harm than good. So I just think that it's probably best that you guys keep asking your questions, but let's have some balanced discussion about this particularly as we move into the development because these things maybe were important, you guys play with being derisked and then unfolding HBP.

My guess is that we probably deferred but lost on the first quarter numbers that you're looking at, and we probably deferred something in the 3,000 to 5,000 BOE per day lost to weather just in that time period.

It's something, I think, you can -- we see strong wells that we're participating in and drilling in. When you get into the wet gas condensate, black oil, just think of that portion of the portfolio, very strong returns across that -- those portions of the base. That's true both in SCOOP as well as STACK. Generally, the deeper, higher pressure areas will have higher IPs, rates, EURs. They've also got generally higher well costs. So for us, it's just math. But we frankly like investments in all 3 of those ranges, and I think that activity with industry over the course of the last couple of years, particularly in the northern portion of the play STACK, we and our friends in the play have been largely focused on the wet gas condensate and volatile oil because of the prevailing macro commodity prices, $45, $50 where we started that. That's the place he can go to get really strong returns. So I think you can see demonstrated in the play, the major operators, the focus has been on returns long before returns discussion became so popular as it is today. And then I've referenced the example in the call, and that was Jackson/Florene pad that we drilled well into the black oil window. And the Meramec wells we added there, 90% returns. So there's been a lot of discussion about it. I mean, look, I'll take higher pressure where you get it. We're not afraid of lower pressure largely drill good wells. I think there's been too much talk about pressures, magic. I'm going to say something I've said for a lot of years. The magic comes from the team. And we've got a great team, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. They're going to kick ass and take names in this development."

Generally, if we're drilling gassier wells, it's because the wet gas condensate or volatile oil. Most of the guys that we referenced is coming from -- as an example, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '17, we talked about OBO, 10-well OBO DSU that had come online down the SCOOP and making in excess of 200 million cubic feet per day, and I think we have 30-something percent working interest. That's all it took to skew the oil percentage in the quarter just very small amount. So as you have these gassier multiwell pads, which are a lot like when we used to turn on offshore platforms come in line with big production rates, they're going to skew small percentage points one quarter to the next. But the key, go back to the comments earlier in the call, is are you generating high returns, and the answer is yes, we want our team to continue to invest in those. So it's just a function of where industry is drilling. Usually, they are HBP activities, some of this that could be taking place as well. We've got some extensional HBP work ourselves out to the Northwest. Some of that's a little bit gassier as well.

By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX publication. We've provided a very detailed outlook for you, and we will reference many of these materials on this morning's call.
Before jumping into 2018 and our 3-year outlook, let me cover a few significant highlights from 2017. 2017 was another solid-performance year for our company. In STACK, we executed an aggressive infill drilling program last year and rapidly advanced our understanding of how to best space and complete our pad developments to optimize returns. 
With HBP requirements largely behind us, we're in a position to be able to maximize value creation, and our plan today is returns-focused. You will see in today's @NFX that we estimate our average STACK well and the 3-year plan will generate about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and have an average well cost of around $7.9 million. This is a function of our planned construct. Well costs will vary from $7.5 million to $9 million depending on where the wells are located across our acreage, EUR flexes with well cost as well. We provide estimated EUR ranges of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent for these wells. When factoring in the differences in well cost and oil cuts across our geographic mix, our rate of return estimates are high and average greater than 50% in the 3-year plan.
We've learned a great deal about well spacing and optimizing completions. On Page 14 in @NFX, we provide a long-dated well performance from our annuity 80 infill wells drilled to date. Note that this comparison includes all wells in which we own an interest, not selected disclosure of our operated wells where we control the spacing and completion designs. 
We are proven relatively consistent well performance against the 1.3 million-barrel oil equivalent type curve and operated pads like Stark, Freeman, Dorothy, Jackson and nonoperated pads like Keith and Ludwig have provided valuable insights, and as a result, we have confidence in high-return developments across the entirety of our acreage. 
We moved early and aggressively to test various spacing configurations to ensure we have the proper science to build long-term value for our owners and development. Our infill tests to date range from 3 wells in a single layer of the Meramec to 12 wells in the full Meramec DSU development. We have drilled spacing tests from west to east. This takes you from the deeper, more pressured gassy regions all the way through the phase envelope and into the far Eastern outer core of the black oil. 
We're applying lots of historical lessons from our original development plans in SCOOP. Early on, in SCOOP, when spaced wells at only 5 to 6 wells per section. Today, we are actively developing SCOOP with 8 to 10 wells per DSU. We are matching the proper science and data with the specific attributes of the rock and tailoring our development plans to maximize well performance, returns and value creation. 
We issued some exciting new results in our SCORE program today as well. Recall that last year, we embarked on resource expansion program to unlock additional producing horizons on our existing acreage in the Anadarko Basin. I'll talk more about SCORE in a moment. 
In the Williston, we continued to drill the best oil wells in the business with larger completions and tighter spacing. We have achieved strong economics both on and off Anticline and are now testing 8 to 9 wells per DSU in our recent developments. 2017, we raised our type curve to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent to reflect recent well performance. As a result of improved well performance in all areas, management of our base production and careful attention to costs, we delivered 10% year-over-year production growth in 2017. More importantly, we maintained a sizable cash balance throughout the year. This cash on hand will be used to balance the near-term differences between our cash flow from operations and our capital investments. 
Proved reserves increased 33% year-over-year, and we replaced 390% of our production with new additions. At year-end 2017, SCOOP and STACK accounted for about 70% of our total proved reserves.
We continue down our path of gaining efficiencies, lowering F&D costs and improving our operating margins. Since 2014, we've improved our cost structure, largely to the growing scale of our Anadarko Basin operations and an intense focus on cost control to expand our margins. These seemingly ordinary steps our team takes each day to do things faster, smarter and safer are now translating to the bottom line. 
Our 3-year outlook is well documented in @NFX, so let me provide some additional commentary around the highlights.
Our 2018 capital budget is approximately $1.3 billion, with 80% of our drilling complete investments allocated to our growth engines in the Anadarko Basin. At $55 per barrel oil and $2.85 for MMBtu gas, we expect that our investment levels and CapEx will align in the second half of this year. 
Looking into 2019 and 2020 at the same price assumptions, we expect to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow, and at $60 per barrel of oil, the free cash flow estimate climbs to $1 billion. We have worked hard to transition our company to be able to deliver double-digit growth within cash flow and improve our debt-adjusted metrics. 
Our 3-year plan projects annualized domestic production growth of 14% to 18%, domestic crude oil growth of 17% to 21%, and on a debt-adjusted basis, production is expected to grow 15% to 20%, and cash flow is expected to grow 20% to 30%. 
Our plan is returns focused. Yesterday, we received a number of questions around our oil growth trajectory in late 2018. Although the year-over-year growth is up, an impressive 20% at the midpoint, our commodity mix changes slightly in the fourth quarter. If we're going to manage our business for returns on the road ahead, we must also learn to be more commodity agnostic. We have some high-rate pads that are scheduled to pop in the second half of 2018, largely due to drilling schedules around our HBP requirements. Because of their geographic location in Western STACK and SCOOP wet gas, natural gas content on these pads will be higher, but please note that the rates of returns are outstanding. 
In today's @NFX, we provided an unprecedented level of transparency in how our 3-year plan was constructed. We've clearly articulated our deliverables, and on the road ahead, we hope this conversation with analysts will shift from simply growth to a more stringent focus on returns. We heard this mandate from our investors, and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors. 
In addition, our 3-year plan was also designed to deliver steady-to-improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the planned period with no additional borrowings. As I mentioned, we work with our Compensation Committee to amend our annual incentive pay metrics for 2018 to include debt-adjusted production growth and cash flow per share metrics, a cash-on-cash return metric and a heightened focus on corporate responsibility. There's a slide in @NFX that provides you with the details. 
I'll turn it over to Larry now to cover the fourth quarter financial results."

Today, we entered 2018 financially strong and are excited about our forward outlook. Due to fortunate timing on previous asset sales, lucrative hedging positions and quick adjustment we made to our investment levels, we were able to weather a very tough period in our business and emerge stronger. The foundation we've created has allowed us to develop the 3-year plan you see today. Let me quickly cover the 2017 financial highlights.
For the fourth quarter, both our earnings and cash flows again came in above Street estimates, and our production was right down the fairway for our most recent guidance. After adjusting for the items mentioned in our news release around refundable tax credits and unrealized derivative losses, our net income for the quarter was $143 million or $0.71 per share. For the full year, after adjusting for those items, net income was $432 million, or $2.15 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Consolidated net production was 57.3 million BOE, up 10% year-over-year when adjusted for asset sales. 
Recall in early 2017, we used what appeared to be, at that time, a conservative oil price of $50 WTI. It turned out that $50 was the right number. As we improved our cost structure and achieved better well performance throughout 2017, we were able to close out the year with a deficit of about $200 million funded by cash on the balance sheet. This excludes acquisitions and divestitures during the year, which largely offset one another. 
Over the last several years, we have maintained the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth will allow us to further delever. This could trigger credit rating upgrade in the plain period as we grow into potential higher credit rating, which should allow us access to capital at premier rates due to the inevitable cycle in our business.
We are approaching 2018 with a very similar strategic mindset. Our budget is based on $55 WTI, and we've run plant sensitivities below -- above and below that assumption. With the significant portion of our 2018 production hedged in the mid-50s, we have insulated ourselves fairly well against downside risk. Likewise, if prices remain above $60, I doubt you will see us significantly change our operating plans. Our 3-year plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth in production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics in an environment that we consider to be mid-cycle oil pricing. 
As you can see in @NFX, we are forecasting significant free cash flow in the 3-year plan at a budget price of $55 oil and quite a bit more at $60 oil. The use of any free cash flow will all depend on the needs of the organization at that time. Like most companies, we will prioritize between reinvestment and acceleration of activity versus a return of cash to investor via debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. The latter, of course, could be catalyzed with the sale of any significant noncore assets.
We will consider all options. As I told Lee, let's get -- let's just get to free cash flow first, then let's assess the road ahead and consider the financial needs of the company. Rest assured, you can count on us to make the right decisions for the owners. 
With that, I'll hand the mic back to Lee."

In the Anadarko Basin, we expect to drill nearly 550 wells through the course of our 3-year plan. Our program will be predominantly pad focused, and operational efficiencies will allow for more wells placed on production per rig. 
2018, about 2/3 of Anadarko Basin wells will be in STACK. Anadarko Basin net production is expected to grow from our 2017 average of just under 100,000 BOE per day to an average of approximately 185,000 BOE per day in 2020. 
Late 2017, we began producing from the Velta June, the most technically advanced Meramec development to date. The Velta June was a collaborative effort by Newfield and our partners to test 12 well spacing in the Meramec formation alone. We drilled 4 3-well pads and focused on targeting, stage and cluster spacing optimization, various proppant loadings and proprietary techniques to optimize the volume of rock stimulating. Although early, flowback is encouraging and in line with expectations. This is a project that we will model and learn from for months to come.
Let me get off script for a moment and address the reaction on our stock price last week after a competitor in the basin referenced its far Eastern STACK results. As the Founder of STACK, we understand the play and have more data than anyone today, especially in the black oil window. We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance. Our Eastern acreage or the outer core of our position constitutes about 10% to 15% of our total STACK acreage position, and our leases were acquired 5 to 7 years ago at well under $1,000 an acre. There are reasons we have elected the pass on previous acquisitions from private operators that may have had different objectives altogether when they drilled wells and identified sweet spots, pumped large completions and touted IP results. We have had a very careful and methodical approach to our HBP drilling. Recall that from the beginning, we referenced the importance of hogging parent wells against the section boundaries to preserve the best development options for the future. Behaviors are different when you want to own and develop an asset over a decade or more. 
Others may have challenged economics going forward, but we are confident there is a lot of oil out there to develop very strong returns. With the depth and quality of our inventory and so much time ahead of us to develop our Eastern acreage, it may be several years before we attack this area in STACK. We're running a marathon, not a sprint. And we have the time and the team to get it right. Now back to my script.
In @NFX today, we specifically called out the recent Jackson/Florene infill in the Eastern black oil window, which tested 4 wells in a single Meramec layer. Take a look at the drawing. The original parent wells were in the Woodford, and we recently came back to test the lower Meramec. We estimate that the Meramec infills had an IRR of approximately 90%. 
In 2018, we will follow up on our Jackson black oil development in the eastern STACK with several new pilots to test up to 6 to 8 total wells with results expected before year-end. 
Our Stark development located in the volatile oil window tested 10 wells in the Meramec and is one of the best return projects to date. After 9 months online, we're estimating 100% IRR.
As we've said before, it's very early. To date, we have 8 operated DSUs where we have drilled infill wells. That's 8 out of about 300 total STACK DSUs we intend to develop over time. We are learning with each new pad and rapidly applying those learnings to deliver stronger returns. 
Let me stay in the Anadarko Basin but switch gears and talk a little bit about SCORE, where we invested in resource expansion program to test the Sycamore, Caney and Osage formations. In addition, we tested an exciting Northwest expansion of our STACK program in the Meramec and continue to extend our SCOOP oil play to the north and east. 
On Page 17 in today's @NFX, we have a detailed map that highlights recent SCORE activity by Newfield and industry. Within our 3-year outlook, we plan to invest about $350 million to drill around 80 wells in these play types. In the North SCOOP, an area where we and industry have recently been more active, results in the oil window have been highly encouraging and set us up for additional development opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Our recent Larry well was very strong with an IP30 of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Yesterday, we also released results from our Northwest STACK extension highlighting an area where the Meramec shale extends. Results are consistent and mimic what we have seen in the heart of STACK. We have an active HBP program planned for this area in 2018. 
With a single rig program, we expect another year of growth in the Williston Basin where our teams are delivering best-in-class well performance in both cost and productivity. Williston is expected to deliver $90 million to $100 million of free cash flow for us in 2018. Last year, we raised our type curve in the Williston, and today's wells have an estimated gross EUR of about 1 million barrels.
Lastly, the Uinta, an area that we have not mentioned in a few years, saw the return of some very prolific oil wells in the Central Basin. The team has done a great job of radically changing operations to cut well costs and improve well productivity and returns. This warrants $130 million that we are allocating in 2018 to HBP this valuable asset for optionality in the future. Over the last 2 years, we quietly executed a JV program that allowed us to test additional horizons, new drilling concepts and proved targeting and tailored completion designs. The results can be found in @NFX. We're extremely encouraged by the reduction in well costs and the enhanced productivity from our wells. 
So why is this significant? We have more than 225,000 net acres in the Uinta with nearly half located in the Central Basin region where industry has been posting some very strong results. The oil content in these wells is 80% to 90%. The basin is thick and overpressured with more than 4,000 feet of STACK hydrocarbon column. The same [indiscernible] that has worked so well for us in the Anadarko Basin also exists in the Uinta.
Before closing out to take your specific questions, let me summarize why we think this plan is a great value proposition for our stockholders. Our 3-year outlook is a strategic recipe to get the most out of our asset base today with targeting investments and high-return drilling programs to rapidly grow our cash flow. This plan moves us to a company that can sustainably grow double-digit within cash flow from operations. We have high confidence in our ability to deliver this plan. Over the last several years, we have significantly derisked our asset base and improved well productivity across the company, all the while strengthening our balance sheet. We have firm footing from which to execute on the road ahead. 
I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses. And as always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

Our teams are delivering top-tier results on every front that we choose to deploy them. And our view is that if we're generating higher returns, everything else takes care of itself. If you look closely at the plan over the 3-year period, you'll actually see that the oil percentage does tick up over the course of the 3-year period. And my view remains, I think I've said this on some earlier calls, that there's way too much focus on small percentage changes quarter-to-quarter. We don't control that. What we control is investing in high-return projects, and that's where our team has been tasked with."

So we invest from time to time in assets to make sure that we're staying current, and we've got the best visibility in terms of the value of that asset within our portfolio. I think I've told you in years past, we've got an embedded grow, hold, divest mentality that lives inside of our organization. It's alive and well. We invested in a JV program there over the previous 2 years. The team took learnings that we have from other areas of activity in Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin notably. Went to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper and the challenge to drive costs down to get the project where it could be competitive within our portfolio. To give you a feel for how far they've driven costs down, we suffered through a couple of years, 2, 3 years early on in the play, when a lot of folks were still trying to tell whether it's a vertical play. We suffered through the early learnings on driving this play to its ultimate places of horizontal resource play. The suffering was that the well cost back in that time period was substantially above $10 million apiece. I would say, mid to -- mid-teens would be a more normal occurrence back then. Over the course of the last few years, our team's quickly driven the costs down below $10 million. And we presently sit in around where we drill and complete the wells that you see on that sheet of paper for around $7 million or less. So pretty dramatic improvement. It does move the play where it's generating competitive returns, but we'll have more to say about the Uinta on the road ahead. But very significant progress that's been made, large resource, and we're going to continue to work to drive value out of that basin."

Last year, we used 50. We did the same thing. 50 was a pretty good call. We're basing this at 55. I think the way I would think about it is you can see what the plan throws off when it gets 60 and above, throwing off a lot of cash. We're well hedged in the short term, so it comes down to how does the commodity move 2018, '19 and '20. So we're well protected to the downside in '18, which means that if prices were to fall lower, we don't have to adjust our plan materially in 2018. We'll keep our eyes open for signals from the market on what the right pace of activity is as the '19 and '20 pricing develops a little bit of clarity. I think you well know that the curves are backward dated today, and we're going to be judicious in terms of how we think about building our hedge book over time. But I think we're in good shape, and $5 move in oil prices, 2018 to the upsides, another $80 million to $100 million cash flow is a way to think about it.

I think we and the industry, there's a lot of other wells on that sheet that are drilled by other companies. I think it proved back and spaced, so I think all 3 of the intervals that we eliminated, the Sycamore, Caney and the Osage, that drilling activity, say that, that resource has been substantively derisked, particularly like how the wells are dispersed around our acreage footprint, that gives you as an investor and owner confidence in that resource. The challenge then becomes the learnings as we go through these multiwell DSU developments with a focus on returns and the challenges for John Jasek and the teams on the operating front are going to be how to fetter in additional work there and continue to work to progress those horizons so that we get the right projects at the front of the line. That's where we're going to be focused. And if it turned out that the right project on the front of the line as a Sycamore well, you'll hear us talking about Sycamore. We also mentioned the extensional work that was done, which I think is substantial North SCOOP, an area where EOG is coming in and drilled some wells as well. It's another new entrant. And that where we announced the 2,000-barrel a day, 30-day rate on the Larry well, I think it's evidence of that. I think our teams have been patient. But we're focused on working really, really hard. Let's call it sense of surge urgency to do the right things right and give the answers early because it's important to get it early so that you get it right early. And that's one of the big challenges for the team. So we'll continue to juggle those investments. We're investing in some 80 wells and those horizons that were derisked with the 2017 program in the 3-year plan. And it will be my expectation that you'll see a shift over time to various parts of that portfolio depending upon returns, commodity mix, macro, all the things that we use to judge where we want to be drilling. But we're very pleased with what we've seen from the SCORE program. And I think it gives us a good visibility on the integrity of the section that we need to be planning to develop, and we clearly achieved the objective expanding the resource.

Generally, we drilled 10,000-foot laterals everywhere we could. We drilled those laterals on opposite sides of the lease line to keep those wells close. That was coming in the early stages of kind of getting some indications what interference might look like overtime. But the other thing it did for us is it left virtually $2 million -- not $2 million -- excuse me, 2 miles of undisturbed ground between that well and the next well that we drilled to HBP, the offsetting [indiscernible]. And we marched through the acreage in that way because we knew that we didn't know the answer. We knew we had the acreage in the HBP, we didn't know the answer about what the absolute final development spacing might be. We talked a lot over the last couple of years about the macro, prevailing commodity prices being part of the equation. We've talked about this being a 3-dimensional geometry problem that the team is working on. It has probably got a lot more dimensions in that when you think about completion mix and intensity and all the other things we're testing as well. But clearly, I think, we'll have the bias for developing to the fullest extent we can, the economically viable section of rock that we see in a particular DSU. And that's going to vary from location to location. We've got some ideas and, we've actually had some tests that we'll probably talk about over the course of this year that John and our team call interface tests. That's where we're drilling interface between Osage and Woodford. And we've had some interesting and encouraging results there. But that's all the setup. That development is being part of the ultimate development cube. So I think there's a lot, lot going on there, and we have some test planned in '18 that will help us advance that ball in 2018."

And the part we were always careful to say is we're not -- we can certainly nod our heads and say we see that, but we don't believe that the biggest job size is necessarily the right solution in development where you have to deal with other issues of drainage, interference, optimal vertical and lateral offset spacing. We really want to keep the stimulated rock volume, that of the high fracture intensity, as close to the wellbore as possible to maximize the recovery out of that stimulated rock volume. And I think with some of the larger wells, you've got to worry about reaching out farther and maybe causing issues for yourself in development mode. And I think that's some of what people have suffered through that came behind some of the private operators that all they cared about was drilling big wells and telling you guys that 5,000-foot wells were the right answer and all the rest of the stuff we had to suffer through 4, 5 years ago. But they're gone. They took their bag of money, and now it's time to develop the assets. And I just want you to know we've been focused on getting ready to develop the assets that were started. And we're excited about the road ahead because we've worked hard to get here."

But I'm going to stay pretty consistent. I'm not a believer. I grew up in production and reservoir engineering is kind of where I spent my time. And I understand all that stuff, and I know that splashy IPs are splashy IPs and sometimes they don't really tell you what's ahead. Our team has done a lot of good work moving back to STACK. I think we've done similar work in the Williston Basin as well, but the Stark pad that was mentioned earlier in -- several times over the course of last year, one of the really cool things they did there is they didn't maximize the early production rates out of those wells and now were telling me about 100% return out of the 10-well DSU in the Meramec. Pretty exciting stuff. If you look at some of their early wells that were drilled around that area, and it'd be easy enough for you guys to find, you'll see some really high, splashy IP rates, but you also saw very high decline rates with those. So in places you have big IP rates and steep decline rates, then the reservoir engineers are probably going to get more nervous in the world and wonder if they're doing more harm than good. So I just think that it's probably best that you guys keep asking your questions, but let's have some balanced discussion about this, particularly as we move into the development, because those things that maybe were important to -- as the play was being derisked and unfolded in HBP, I believe, were going to be less and less important kind of on the road ahead. That's my personal view."

It's something, I think, that you can drill -- we see strong wells that we're participating in and drilling in. When you get into the wet gas condensate, volatile oil, black oil, if you just think of that portion of the portfolio, very strong returns across that -- those portions of the base offload. That's true both in SCOOP as well as STACK. Generally, the deeper or higher pressured areas will have higher IPs, rates, EURs. They've also got generally higher well cost. So for us, it's just math, but we frankly like investments in all 3 of those regions. And I think that activity with industry over the course of the last couple years, particularly in the northern portion of the play STACK, we and our friends in the play have been largely focused on the wet gas condensate and volatile oil regime because with the prevailing macro, commodity prices, $45, $50 where we started that, that was the place you could go to get really strong returns. So I think you can see demonstrated in the play, the major operators, the focus has been on returns long before returns discussion became so popular as it is today. And then I referenced the example in the call of -- and that was the Jackson/Florene pad, that we put it well into the black oil window. And the Meramec wells that we added there are 90% returns. So -- but there has been a lot of discussion about it. I mean, look, I'll take higher pressure where you can get it. We're not afraid of lower pressure as long as you can drill good wells.

That's all it took to skew the oil percentage in the quarter just a very small amount. So as you have these gassier multi-well pads, which are a lot like when we used to turn on offshore platforms coming on with big production rates, they're going to skew small percentage points one quarter to the next. But the key, go back to the comments on the -- earlier in the call is, are you generating high returns? And the answer is yes, we want our team to continue to invest in those. So it's just a function of where industry is drilling. Usually, they're HBP activities, some of this, that could be taking place as well. We've got some extensional HBP work ourselves out to the Northwest. Some of that's a little bit gassier as well.

By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX public",1245,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 conference call. 2018 is now well underway, and we're excited to share our forward outlook with you this morning. 
By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX publication. We've provided a very detailed outlook for you, and we will reference many of these materials on this morning's call.
Before jumping into 2018 and our 3-year outlook, let me cover a few significant highlights from 2017. 2017 was another solid-performance year for our company. In STACK, we executed an aggressive infill drilling program last year and rapidly advanced our understanding of how to best space and complete our pad developments to optimize returns. 
With HBP requirements largely behind us, we're in a position to be able to maximize value creation, and our plan today is returns-focused. You will see in today's @NFX that we estimate our average STACK well in the 3-year plan will generate about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and have an average well cost of around $7.9 million. This is a function of our planned construct. Well costs will vary from $7.5 million to $9 million depending on where the wells are located across our acreage, EUR flexes with well cost as well. We provide estimated EUR ranges of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent for these wells. When factoring in the differences in well cost and oil cuts across our geographic mix, our rate of return estimates are high and average greater than 50% in the 3-year plan.
We've learned a great deal about well spacing and optimizing completions. On Page 14 in @NFX, we provide a long-dated well performance from our nearly 80 infill wells drilled to date. Note that this comparison includes all wells in which we own an interest, not selective disclosure of our operated wells where we control the spacing and completion designs. 
We are proven relatively consistent well performance against the 1.3 million-barrel oil equivalent type curve and operated pads like Stark, Freeman, Dorothy, Jackson and nonoperated pads like Eve and Ludwig have provided valuable insights, and as a result, we have confidence in high-return developments across the entirety of our acreage. 
We moved early and aggressively to test various spacing configurations to ensure we have the proper science to build long-term value for our owners and development. Our infill tests to date range from 3 wells in a single layer of the Meramec to 12 wells in the full Meramec DSU development. We have drilled spacing tests from west to east. This takes you from the deeper, more pressured gassy regions all the way through the phase envelope and into the far Eastern outer core of the black oil. 
We're applying lots of historical lessons from our original development plans in SCOOP. Early on, in SCOOP, we spaced wells at only 5 to 6 wells per section. Today, we are actively developing SCOOP with 8 to 10 wells per DSU. We are matching the proper science and data with the specific attributes of the rock and tailoring our development plans to maximize well performance, returns and value creation. 
We issued some exciting new results in our SCORE program today as well. Recall that last year, we embarked on resource expansion program to unlock additional producing horizons on our existing acreage in the Anadarko Basin. I'll talk more about SCORE in a moment. 
In the Williston, we continue to drill the best oil wells in the business with larger completions and tighter spacing. We have achieved strong economics both on- and off-anticline and are now testing 8 to 9 wells per DSU in our recent developments. 2017, we raised our type curve to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent to reflect recent well performance. As a result of improved well performance in all areas, management of our base production and careful attention to costs, we delivered 10% year-over-year production growth in 2017. More importantly, we maintained a sizable cash balance throughout the year. This cash on hand will be used to balance the near-term differences between our cash flow from operations and our capital investments. 
Proved reserves increased 33% year-over-year, and we replaced 390% of our production with new additions. At year-end 2017, SCOOP and STACK accounted for about 70% of our total proved reserves.
We continue down our path of gaining efficiencies, lowering F&D costs and improving our operating margins. Since 2014, we've improved our cost structure, owed largely to the growing scale of our Anadarko Basin operations and an intense focus on cost control to expand our margins. These seemingly ordinary steps our team takes each day to do things faster, smarter and safer are now translating to the bottom line. 
Our 3-year outlook is well documented in @NFX, but let me provide some additional commentary around the highlights.
Our 2018 capital budget is approximately $1.3 billion, with 80% of our drilling complete investments allocated to our growth engines in the Anadarko Basin. At $55 per barrel oil and $2.85 for MMBtu gas, we expect that our investment levels of CapEx will align in the second half of this year. 
Looking into 2019 and 2020 at the same price assumptions, we expect to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow, and at $60 per barrel of oil, the free cash flow estimate climbs to $1 billion. We have worked hard to transition our company to be able to deliver double-digit growth within cash flow and improve our debt-adjusted metrics. 
Our 3-year plan projects annualized domestic production growth of 14% to 18%, domestic crude oil growth of 17% to 21%, and on a debt-adjusted basis, production is expected to grow 15% to 20%, and cash flow is expected to grow 20% to 30%. 
Our plan is returns focused. Yesterday, we received a number of questions around our oil growth trajectory in late 2018. Although the year-over-year growth is up, an impressive 20% at the midpoint, our commodity mix changes slightly in the fourth quarter. If we're going to manage our business for returns on the road ahead, we must also learn to be more commodity agnostic. We have some high-rate pads that are scheduled to pop in the second half of 2018, largely due to drilling schedules around our HBP requirements. Because of their geographic location in Western STACK and SCOOP wet gas, natural gas content on these pads will be higher, but please note that the rates of returns are outstanding. 
In today's @NFX, we provided an unprecedented level of transparency in how our 3-year plan was constructed. We've clearly articulated our deliverables, and on the road ahead, we hope the conversation with analysts will shift from simply growth to a more stringent focus on returns. We heard this mandate from our investors, and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors. 
In addition, our 3-year plan was also designed to deliver steady-to-improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the plan period with no additional borrowings. As I mentioned, we work with our Compensation Committee to amend our annual incentive pay metrics for 2018 to include debt-adjusted production growth and cash flow per share metrics, a cash-on-cash return metric and a heightened focus on corporate responsibility. There's a slide in @NFX that provides you with the details. 
I'll turn it over to Larry now to cover the fourth quarter financial results."

Today, we enter 2018 financially strong and are excited about our forward outlook. Due to fortunate timing on previous asset sales, lucrative hedging positions and quick adjustments we made to our investment levels, we were able to weather a very tough period in our business and emerge stronger. The foundation we've created has allowed us to develop the 3-year plan you see today. Let me quickly cover the 2017 financial highlights.
For the fourth quarter, both our earnings and cash flows again came in above Street estimates, and our production was right down the fairway for our most recent guidance. After adjusting for the items mentioned in our news release around refundable tax credits and unrealized derivative losses, our net income for the quarter was $143 million or $0.71 per share. For the full year, after adjusting for those items, net income was $432 million, or $2.15 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Consolidated net production was 57.3 million BOE, up 10% year-over-year when adjusted for asset sales. 
Recall in early 2017, we used what appeared to be, at that time, a conservative oil price of $50 WTI. It turned out that $50 was the right number. As we improved our cost structure and achieved better well performance throughout 2017, we were able to close out the year with a deficit of about $200 million funded by cash on the balance sheet. This excludes acquisitions and divestitures during the year, which largely offset one another. 
Over the last several years, we have maintained the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth will allow us to further delever. This could trigger credit rating upgrade in the plan period as we grow into potential higher credit rating, which should allow us access to capital at premier rates through the inevitable cycle in our business.
We are approaching 2018 with a very similar strategic mindset. Our budget is based on $55 WTI, and we've run plan sensitivities above and below that assumption. With the significant portion of our 2018 production hedged in the mid-50s, we have insulated ourselves fairly well against downside risk. Likewise, if prices remain above $60, I doubt you will see us significantly change our operating plans. Our 3-year plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth in production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics in an environment that we consider to be mid-cycle oil pricing. 
As you can see in @NFX, we are forecasting significant free cash flow in the 3-year plan at a budget price of $55 oil and quite a bit more at $60 oil. The use of any free cash flow will all depend on the needs of the organization at that time. Like most companies, we will prioritize between reinvestment and acceleration of activity versus a return of cash to the investor via debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. The latter, of course, could be catalyzed by the sale of any significant noncore assets.
We will consider all options. As I told Lee, let's get -- let's just get to free cash flow first, then let's assess the road ahead and consider the financial needs of the company. Rest assured, you can count on us to make the right decisions for the owners. 
With that, I'll hand the mic back to Lee."

In the Anadarko Basin, we expect to drill nearly 550 wells through the course of our 3-year plan. Our program will be predominantly pad focused, and operational efficiencies will allow for more wells placed on production per rig. 
2018, about 2/3 of Anadarko Basin wells will be in STACK. Anadarko Basin net production is expected to grow from our 2017 average of just under 100,000 BOE per day to an average of approximately 185,000 BOE per day in 2020. 
Late 2017, we began producing from the Velta June, the most technically advanced Meramec development to date. The Velta June was a collaborative effort by Newfield and our partners to test 12 well spacing in the Meramec formation alone. We drilled 4 3-well pads and focused on targeting, stage and cluster spacing optimization, various proppant loadings and proprietary techniques to optimize the volume of rock stimulating. Although early, flowback is encouraging and in line with expectations. This is a project that we will model and learn from for months to come.
Let me get off script for a moment and address the reaction on our stock price last week after a competitor in the basin referenced its far Eastern STACK results. As the Founder of STACK, we understand the play and have more data than anyone today, especially in the black oil window. We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance. Our Eastern acreage or the outer core of our position constitutes about 10% to 15% of our total STACK acreage position, and our leases were acquired 5 to 7 years ago at well under $1,000 an acre. There are reasons we have elected to pass on previous acquisitions from private operators that may have had different objectives altogether when they drilled wells and identified sweet spots, pumped large completions and touted IP results. We have had a very careful and methodical approach to our HBP drilling. Recall that from the beginning, we referenced the importance of hugging parent wells against the section boundaries to preserve the best development options for the future. Behaviors are different when you want to own and develop an asset over a decade or more. 
Others may have challenged economics going forward, but we are confident there is a lot of oil out there to develop at very strong returns. With the depth and quality of our inventory and so much time ahead of us to develop our Eastern acreage, it may be several years before we attack this area in STACK. We're running a marathon, not a sprint. And we have the time and the team to get it right. Now back to my script.
In @NFX today, we specifically called out the recent Jackson/Florene infill in the Eastern black oil window, which tested 4 wells in a single Meramec layer. Take a look at the drawing. The original parent wells were in the Woodford, and we recently came back to test the lower Meramec. We estimate that the Meramec infills had an IRR of approximately 90%. 
In 2018, we will follow up on our Jackson black oil development in the eastern STACK with several new pilots to test up to 6 to 8 total wells with results expected before year-end. 
Our Stark development located in the volatile oil window tested 10 wells in the Meramec and is one of the best return projects to date. After 9 months online, we're estimating 100% IRR.
As we've said before, it's very early. To date, we have 8 operated DSUs where we have drilled infill wells. That's 8 out of about 300 total STACK DSUs we intend to develop over time. We are learning with each new pad and rapidly applying those learnings to deliver stronger returns. 
Let me stay in the Anadarko Basin but switch gears and talk a little bit about SCORE, where we invested in resource expansion program to test the Sycamore, Caney and Osage formations. In addition, we tested an exciting Northwest expansion of our STACK program in the Meramec and continue to extend our SCOOP oil play to the north and east. 
On Page 17 in today's @NFX, we have a detailed map that highlights recent SCORE activity by Newfield and industry. Within our 3-year outlook, we plan to invest about $350 million to drill around 80 wells in these play types. In North SCOOP, an area where we and industry have recently been more active, results in the oil window have been highly encouraging and set us up for additional development opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Our recent Larry well was very strong with an IP30 of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Yesterday, we also released results from our Northwest STACK extension highlighting an area where the Meramec shale extends. Results are consistent and mimic what we have seen in the heart of STACK. We have an active HBP program planned for this area in 2018. 
With a single rig program, we expect another year of growth in the Williston Basin where our teams are delivering best-in-class well performance in both cost and productivity. Williston is expected to deliver $90 million to $100 million of free cash flow for us in 2018. Last year, we raised our type curve in the Williston, and today's wells have an estimated gross EUR of about 1 million barrels.
Lastly, the Uinta, an area that we have not mentioned in a few years, saw the return of some very prolific oil wells in the Central Basin. The team has done a great job of radically changing operations to cut well costs and improve well productivity and returns. This warrants $130 million that we are allocating in 2018 to HBP this valuable asset for optionality in the future. Over the last 2 years, we quietly executed a JV program that allowed us to test additional horizons, new drilling concepts, improved targeting and tailored completion designs. The results can be found in @NFX. We're extremely encouraged about the reduction in well costs and the enhanced productivity from our wells. 
So why is this significant? We have more than 225,000 net acres in the Uinta with nearly half located in the Central Basin region where industry has been posting some very strong results. The oil content in these wells is 80% to 90%. The basin is thick and overpressured with more than 4,000 feet of STACK hydrocarbon column. The same [indiscernible] that has worked so well for us in the Anadarko Basin also exists in the Uinta.
Before closing out to take your specific questions, let me summarize why we think this plan is a great value proposition for our stockholders. Our 3-year outlook is a strategic recipe to get the most out of our asset base today with targeting investments and high-return drilling programs to rapidly grow our cash flow. This plan moves us to a company that can sustainably grow double-digit within cash flow from operations. We have high confidence in our ability to deliver this plan. Over the last several years, we have significantly derisked our asset base and improved well productivity across the company, all the while strengthening our balance sheet. We have firm footing from which to execute on the road ahead. 
I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses. And as always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

I think I've told you in years past, we've got an embedded grow, hold, divest mentality that lives inside of our organization. It's alive and well. We invested in a JV program there over the previous 2 years. The team took learnings that we had from other areas of activity, Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin notably. Went to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper and the challenge to drive costs down to get the project where it could be competitive within our portfolio. To give you a feel for how far they've driven costs down, we suffered through a couple of years, 2, 3 years early on in the play, when a lot of folks were still trying to tell everybody it's a vertical play. We suffered through the early learnings on driving this play to its ultimate places as a horizontal resource play. The suffering was that the well cost back in that time period was substantially above $10 million apiece. I would say, mid to -- mid-teens would be a more normal occurrence back then. Over the course of the last few years, our team's quickly driven the costs down below $10 million. And we presently sit in around where we drill and complete the wells that you see on that sheet of paper for around $7 million or less. So a pretty dramatic improvement. It does move the play where it's generating competitive returns, but we'll have more to say about the Uinta on the road ahead. But very significant progress that's been made, large resource, and we're going to continue to work to drive value out of that basin."

We're well hedged in the short term, so it comes down to how does the commodity move 2018, '19 and '20. So we're well protected to the downside in '18, which means that if prices were to fall lower, we don't have to adjust our plan materially in 2018.

I think we and industry, because there's a lot of other wells on that sheet that are drilled by other companies. I think it proved that in spades, so I think all 3 of the intervals that we eliminated, the Sycamore, Caney and the Osage, that drilling activity, say that, that resource has been substantively derisked. I particularly like how the wells are dispersed around our acreage footprint, that gives you -- should give you as an investor an owner of confidence in that resource. The challenge then becomes the learnings as we go through these multiwell DSU developments with a focus on returns. The challenges for John Jasek and the teams on the operating front are going to be how to feather in additional work there and continue to work to progress those horizons so that we get the right projects at the front of the line. That's where we're going to be focused. And if it turned out that the right project at the front of the line is a Sycamore well, you'll hear us talking about Sycamore. We also mentioned the extensional work that was done, which I think is substantial North SCOOP, an area where EOG is coming in and drilled some wells as well. It's another new entrant. And that where we announced the 2,000-barrel a day, 30-day rate on the Larry well, I think is evidence of that. I think our teams have been patient. But we're focused on working really, really hard. Let's call it a sense of urgency to do the right things right and give the answers early, because it's important to get it early so that you get it right early. And that's one of the big challenges for our team. So we'll continue to juggle those investments. We're investing in some 80 wells and those horizons that were derisked with the 2017 program in the 3-year plan. And it would be my expectation that you'll see a shift over time to various parts of that portfolio depending upon returns, commodity mix, macro, all the things that we use to judge where we want to be drilling. But we're very pleased with what we've seen from the SCORE program. And I think it gives us good visibility on the entirety of the section that we need to be planning to develop, and we clearly achieved the objective expanding the resource. I think we got 3 billion barrels plus now in the Anadarko Basin alone."

So I think, first let me take you back, and I mentioned this in the comments, prepared comments earlier, but take you back to what our team did to the fullest extent possible while we're in HBP mode. Generally, we drilled 10,000-foot laterals everywhere we could. We drilled those laterals on opposite sides of the lease line to keep those wells close. That was coming in the early stages of kind of getting some indications what interference might look like over time. But the other thing it did for us is it left virtually 2 million -- not 2 million -- excuse me, 2 miles of undisturbed ground between that well and the next well that we drilled to HBP, the offsetting [ section ]. And we marched through the acreage in that way because we knew that we didn't know the answer. We knew we had the acreage in the HBP, we didn't know the answer about what the absolute final development spacing might be. We talked a lot over the last couple of years about the macro, prevailing commodity prices being part of the equation. We've talked about this being a 3-dimensional geometry problem that the team is working on. It has probably got a lot more dimensions than that when you think about completion mix and intensity and all the other things we're testing as well. But clearly, I think, we'll have a bias for developing to the fullest extent we can, the economically viable section of rock that we see in a particular DSU. And that's going to vary from location to location. We've got some ideas, and we've actually had some tests that we'll probably talk about over the course of this year that John and our team call interface tests. That's where we're drilling interface between Osage and Woodford. And we've had some interesting and encouraging results there. But that's all the setup. That development is being part of the ultimate development cube. So I think there's a lot, lot going on there, and we have some tests planned in '18 that will help us advance that ball in 2018."

We've been more focused on what's the right way to develop a play. And I think that one of the things we were careful to talk about as we and industry were upping fluid volumes and proppant concentrations over the last 2 or 3 years is there's clearly been a direct relationship between volume pumped, proppant and fluid, and rate and EURs. So clearly, bigger volumes, bigger wells. And that was always an unbounded circumstance. And the part we were always careful to say is we're not -- we can certainly nod our head and say we see that, but we don't believe that the biggest job size is necessarily the right solution in development where you have to deal with other issues of drainage, interference, optimal vertical and lateral offset spacing. We really want to keep the stimulated rock volume, that of the high fracture intensity, as close to the wellbore as possible to maximize the recovery out of that stimulated rock volume. And I think with some of the larger wells, you've got to worry about reaching out farther and maybe causing issues for yourself in development mode. And I think that's some of what people have suffered through that came behind some of the private operators that all they cared about was drilling big wells and telling you guys that 5,000-foot wells were the right answer and all the rest of the stuff we had to suffer through 4, 5 years ago.

And I understand all that stuff, and I know that splashy IPs are splashy IPs, and sometimes they don't really tell you what's ahead. Our team has done a lot of good work moving back to STACK. I think we've done similar work in the Williston Basin as well. But the Stark pad that was mentioned earlier and several times over the course of last year, one of the really cool things they did there is they didn't maximize the early production rates out of those wells, and now we're telling you about 100% return out of a 10-well DSU in the Meramec. Pretty exciting stuff. If you look at some of the early wells that were drilled around that area, and it'd be easy enough for you guys to find, you'll see some really high, splashy IP rates, but you also saw very high decline rates with those. So in places you have big IP rates and steep decline rates, then the reservoir engineers are probably going to get nervous in the world and wonder if they're doing more harm than good. So I just think that it's probably best that you guys keep asking your questions, but let's have some balanced discussion about this, particularly as we move into development, because those things that maybe were important to -- as the play was being derisked and unfolded in HBP, I believe, are going to be less and less important kind of on the road ahead.

When you get into the wet gas condensate, volatile oil, black oil, if you just think of that portion of the portfolio, very strong returns across that -- those portions of the phase offload. That's true both in SCOOP as well as STACK. Generally, the deeper, higher pressured areas will have higher IPs, rates, EURs. They've also got generally higher well cost. So for us, it's just math, but we frankly like investments in all 3 of those regions. And I think that activity with industry over the course of the last couple years, particularly in the northern portion of the play STACK, we and our friends in the play have been largely focused on the wet gas condensate and volatile oil regime because with the prevailing macro, commodity prices, $45, $50 where we started that, that was the place you could go to get really strong returns. So I think you can see demonstrated in the play, the major operators, the focus has been on returns long before returns discussion became so popular as it is today. And then I referenced an example in the call of -- and that was a Jackson/Florene pad, that we put it well into the black oil window. And the Meramec wells that we added there are 90% returns.

Most of the gas that we reference is coming from -- as an example, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '17, we talked about OBO, 10-well OBO DSU that had come online down the SCOOP and that was making in excess of 200 million cubic feet a day and I think we had 30-something percent working interest. That's all it took to skew the oil percentage in the quarter just a very small amount. So as you have these gassier multi-well pads, which are a lot like when we used to turn on offshore platforms coming on with big production rates, they're going to skew small percentage points one quarter to the next. But the key, go back to the comments on the -- earlier in the call is, are you generating high returns? And the answer is yes, we want our team to continue to invest in those. So it's just a function of where industry is drilling. Usually, they're HBP activities, some of this that could be taking place as well. We've got some extensional HBP work ourselves out to the Northwest. Some of that's a little bit gassier as well. But we're not chasing -- if you've heard anything today, we're not trying to absolutely manicure micro percentages on the various product mixes. We're chasing returns, and we'll let the product mix fall where they do."

By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX publication. We've provided a very detailed outlook for you, and we will reference many of these materials on this morning's call.
Before jumping into 2018 and our 3-year outlook, let me cover a few significant highlights from 2017. 2017 was another solid-performance year for our company. In STACK, we executed an aggressive infill drilling program last year and rapidly advanced our understanding of how to best space and complete our pad developments to optimize returns. 
With HBP requirements largely behind us, we're in a position to be able to maximize value creation, and our plan today is returns-focused. You will see in today's @NFX that we estimate our average STACK well in the 3-year plan will generate about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and have an average well cost of around $7.9 million. This is a function of our planned construct. Well costs will vary from $7.5 million to $9 million depending on where the wells are located across our acreage, EUR flexes with well cost as well. We provide estimated EUR ranges of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent for these wells. When factoring in the differences in well cost and oil cuts across our geographic mix, our rate of return estimates are high and average greater than 50% in the 3-year plan.
We've learned a great deal about well spacing and optimizing completions. On Page 14 in @NFX, we provide a long-dated well performance from our nearly 80 infill wells drilled to date. Note that this comparison includes all wells in which we own an interest, not selective disclosure of our operated wells where we control the spacing and completion designs. 
We are proven relatively consistent well performance against the 1.3 million-barrel oil equivalent type curve and operated pads like Stark, Freeman, Dorothy, Jackson and nonoperated pads like Eve and Ludwig have provided valuable insights, and as a result, we have confidence in high-return developments across the entirety of our acreage. 
We moved early and aggressively to test various spacing configurations to ensure we have the proper science to build long-term value for our owners and development. Our infill tests to date range from 3 wells in a single layer of the Meramec to 12 wells in the full Meramec DSU development. We have drilled spacing tests from west to east. This takes you from the deeper, more pressured gassy regions all the way through the phase envelope and into the far Eastern outer core of the black oil. 
We're applying lots of historical lessons from our original development plans in SCOOP. Early on, in SCOOP, we spaced wells at only 5 to 6 wells per section. Today, we are actively developing SCOOP with 8 to 10 wells per DSU. We are matching the proper science and data with the specific attributes of the rock and tailoring our development plans to maximize well performance, returns and value creation. 
We issued some exciting new results in our SCORE program today as well. Recall that last year, we embarked on resource expansion program to unlock additional producing horizons on our existing acreage in the Anadarko Basin. I'll talk more about SCORE in a moment. 
In the Williston, we continue to drill the best oil wells in the business with larger completions and tighter spacing. We have achieved strong economics both on- and off-anticline and are now testing 8 to 9 wells per DSU in our recent developments. 2017, we raised our type curve to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent to reflect recent well performance. As a result of improved well performance in all areas, management of our base production and careful attention to costs, we delivered 10% year-over-year production growth in 2017. More importantly, we maintained a sizable cash balance throughout the year. This cash on hand will be used to balance the near-term differences between our cash flow from operations and our capital investments. 
Proved reserves increased 33% year-over-year, and we replaced 390% of our production with new additions. At year-end 2017, SCOOP and STACK accounted for about 70% of our total proved reserves.
We continue down our path of gaining efficiencies, lowering F&D costs and improving our operating margins. Since 2014, we've improved our cost structure, owed largely to the growing scale of our Anadarko Basin operations and an intense focus on cost control to expand our margins. These seemingly ordinary steps our team takes each day to do things faster, smarter and safer are now translating to the bottom line. 
Our 3-year outlook is well documented in @NFX, but let me provide some additional commentary around the highlights.
Our 2018 capital budget is approximately $1.3 billion, with 80% of our drilling complete investments allocated to our growth engines in the Anadarko Basin. At $55 per barrel oil and $2.85 for MMBtu gas, we expect that our investment levels of CapEx will align in the second half of this year. 
Looking into 2019 and 2020 at the same price assumptions, we expect to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow, and at $60 per barrel of oil, the free cash flow estimate climbs to $1 billion. We have worked hard to transition our company to be able to deliver double-digit growth within cash flow and improve our debt-adjusted metrics. 
Our 3-year plan projects annualized domestic production growth of 14% to 18%, domestic crude oil growth of 17% to 21%, and on a debt-adjusted basis, production is expected to grow 15% to 20%, and cash flow is expected to grow 20% to 30%. 
Our plan is returns focused. Yesterday, we received a number of questions around our oil growth trajectory in late 2018. Although the year-over-year growth is up, an impressive 20% at the midpoint, our commodity mix changes slightly in the fourth quarter. If we're going to manage our business for returns on the road ahead, we must also learn to be more commodity agnostic. We have some high-rate pads that are scheduled to pop in the second half of 2018, largely due to drilling schedules around our HBP requirements. Because of their geographic location in Western STACK and SCOOP wet gas, natural gas content on these pads will be higher, but please note that the rates of returns are outstanding. 
In today's @NFX, we provided an unprecedented level of transparency in how our 3-year plan was constructed. We've clearly articulated our deliverables, and on the road ahead, we hope the conversation with analysts will shift from simply growth to a more stringent focus on returns. We heard this mandate from our investors, and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors. 
In addition, our 3-year plan was also designed to deliver steady-to-improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the plan period with no additional borrowings. As I mentioned, we work with our Compensation Committee to amend our annual incentive pay metrics for 2018 to include debt-adjusted production growth and cash flow per share metrics, a cash-on-cash return metric and a heightened focus on corporate responsibility. There's a slide in @NFX that provides you with the details. 
I'll turn it over to Larry now to cover the fourth quarter financial results."

Today, we enter 2018 financially strong and are excited about our forward outlook. Due to fortunate timing on previous asset sales, lucrative hedging positions and quick adjustments we made to our investment levels, we were able to weather a very tough period in our business and emerge stronger. The foundation we've created has allowed us to develop the 3-year plan you see today. Let me quickly cover the 2017 financial highlights.
For the fourth quarter, both our earnings and cash flows again came in above Street estimates, and our production was right down the fairway for our most recent guidance. After adjusting for the items mentioned in our news release around refundable tax credits and unrealized derivative losses, our net income for the quarter was $143 million or $0.71 per share. For the full year, after adjusting for those items, net income was $432 million, or $2.15 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Consolidated net production was 57.3 million BOE, up 10% year-over-year when adjusted for asset sales. 
Recall in early 2017, we used what appeared to be, at that time, a conservative oil price of $50 WTI. It turned out that $50 was the right number. As we improved our cost structure and achieved better well performance throughout 2017, we were able to close out the year with a deficit of about $200 million funded by cash on the balance sheet. This excludes acquisitions and divestitures during the year, which largely offset one another. 
Over the last several years, we have maintained the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth will allow us to further delever. This could trigger credit rating upgrade in the plan period as we grow into potential higher credit rating, which should allow us access to capital at premier rates through the inevitable cycle in our business.
We are approaching 2018 with a very similar strategic mindset. Our budget is based on $55 WTI, and we've run plan sensitivities above and below that assumption. With the significant portion of our 2018 production hedged in the mid-50s, we have insulated ourselves fairly well against downside risk. Likewise, if prices remain above $60, I doubt you will see us significantly change our operating plans. Our 3-year plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth in production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics in an environment that we consider to be mid-cycle oil pricing. 
As you can see in @NFX, we are forecasting significant free cash flow in the 3-year plan at a budget price of $55 oil and quite a bit more at $60 oil. The use of any free cash flow will all depend on the needs of the organization at that time. Like most companies, we will prioritize between reinvestment and acceleration of activity versus a return of cash to the investor via debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. The latter, of course, could be catalyzed by the sale of any significant noncore assets.
We will consider all options. As I told Lee, let's get -- let's just get to free cash flow first, then let's assess the road ahead and consider the financial needs of the company. Rest assured, you can count on us to make the right decisions for the owners. 
With that, I'll hand the mic back to Lee."

In the Anadarko Basin, we expect to drill nearly 550 wells through the course of our 3-year plan. Our program will be predominantly pad focused, and operational efficiencies will allow for more wells placed on production per rig. 
2018, about 2/3 of Anadarko Basin wells will be in STACK. Anadarko Basin net production is expected to grow from our 2017 average of just under 100,000 BOE per day to an average of approximately 185,000 BOE per day in 2020. 
Late 2017, we began producing from the Velta June, the most technically advanced Meramec development to date. The Velta June was a collaborative effort by Newfield and our partners to test 12 well spacing in the Meramec formation alone. We drilled 4 3-well pads and focused on targeting, stage and cluster spacing optimization, various proppant loadings and proprietary techniques to optimize the volume of rock stimulating. Although early, flowback is encouraging and in line with expectations. This is a project that we will model and learn from for months to come.
Let me get off script for a moment and address the reaction on our stock price last week after a competitor in the basin referenced its far Eastern STACK results. As the Founder of STACK, we understand the play and have more data than anyone today, especially in the black oil window. We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance. Our Eastern acreage or the outer core of our position constitutes about 10% to 15% of our total STACK acreage position, and our leases were acquired 5 to 7 years ago at well under $1,000 an acre. There are reasons we have elected to pass on previous acquisitions from private operators that may have had different objectives altogether when they drilled wells and identified sweet spots, pumped large completions and touted IP results. We have had a very careful and methodical approach to our HBP drilling. Recall that from the beginning, we referenced the importance of hugging parent wells against the section boundaries to preserve the best development options for the future. Behaviors are different when you want to own and develop an asset over a decade or more. 
Others may have challenged economics going forward, but we are confident there is a lot of oil out there to develop at very strong returns. With the depth and quality of our inventory and so much time ahead of us to develop our Eastern acreage, it may be several years before we attack this area in STACK. We're running a marathon, not a sprint. And we have the time and the team to get it right. Now back to my script.
In @NFX today, we specifically called out the recent Jackson/Florene infill in the Eastern black oil window, which tested 4 wells in a single Meramec layer. Take a look at the drawing. The original parent wells were in the Woodford, and we recently came back to test the lower Meramec. We estimate that the Meramec infills had an IRR of approximately 90%. 
In 2018, we will follow up on our Jackson black oil development in the eastern STACK with several new pilots to test up to 6 to 8 total wells with results expected before year-end. 
Our Stark development located in the volatile oil window tested 10 wells in the Meramec and is one of the best return projects to date. After 9 months online, we're estimating 100% IRR.
As we've said before, it's very early. To date, we have 8 operated DSUs where we have drilled infill wells. That's 8 out of about 300 total STACK DSUs we intend to develop over time. We are learning with each new pad and rapidly applying those learnings to deliver stronger returns. 
Let me stay in the Anadarko Basin but switch gears and talk a little bit about SCORE, where we invested in resource expansion program to test the Sycamore, Caney and Osage formations. In addition, we tested an exciting Northwest expansion of our STACK program in the Meramec and continue to extend our SCOOP oil play to the north and east. 
On Page 17 in today's @NFX, we have a detailed map that highlights recent SCORE activity by Newfield and industry. Within our 3-year outlook, we plan to invest about $350 million to drill around 80 wells in these play types. In North SCOOP, an area where we and industry have recently been more active, results in the oil window have been highly encouraging and set us up for additional development opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Our recent Larry well was very strong with an IP30 of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Yesterday, we also released results from our Northwest STACK extension highlighting an area where the Meramec shale extends. Results are consistent and mimic what we have seen in the heart of STACK. We have an active HBP program planned for this area in 2018. 
With a single rig program, we expect another year of growth in the Williston Basin where our teams are delivering best-in-class well performance in both cost and productivity. Williston is expected to deliver $90 million to $100 million of free cash flow for us in 2018. Last year, we raised our type curve in the Williston, and today's wells have an estimated gross EUR of about 1 million barrels.
Lastly, the Uinta, an area that we have not mentioned in a few years, saw the return of some very prolific oil wells in the Central Basin. The team has done a great job of radically changing operations to cut well costs and improve well productivity and returns. This warrants $130 million that we are allocating in 2018 to HBP this valuable asset for optionality in the future. Over the last 2 years, we quietly executed a JV program that allowed us to test additional horizons, new drilling concepts, improved targeting and tailored completion designs. The results can be found in @NFX. We're extremely encouraged about the reduction in well costs and the enhanced productivity from our wells. 
So why is this significant? We have more than 225,000 net acres in the Uinta with nearly half located in the Central Basin region where industry has been posting some very strong results. The oil content in these wells is 80% to 90%. The basin is thick and overpressured with more than 4,000 feet of STACK hydrocarbon column. The same [indiscernible] that has worked so well for us in the Anadarko Basin also exists in the Uinta.
Before closing out to take your specific questions, let me summarize why we think this plan is a great value proposition for our stockholders. Our 3-year outlook is a strategic recipe to get the most out of our asset base today with targeting investments and high-return drilling programs to rapidly grow our cash flow. This plan moves us to a company that can sustainably grow double-digit within cash flow from operations. We have high confidence in our ability to deliver this plan. Over the last several years, we have significantly derisked our asset base and improved well productivity across the company, all the while strengthening our balance sheet. We have firm footing from which to execute on the road ahead. 
I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses. And as always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

I think I've told you in years past, we've got an embedded grow, hold, divest mentality that lives inside of our organization. It's alive and well. We invested in a JV program there over the previous 2 years. The team took learnings that we had from other areas of activity, Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin notably. Went to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper and the challenge to drive costs down to get the project where it could be competitive within our portfolio. To give you a feel for how far they've driven costs down, we suffered through a couple of years, 2, 3 years early on in the play, when a lot of folks were still trying to tell everybody it's a vertical play. We suffered through the early learnings on driving this play to its ultimate places as a horizontal resource play. The suffering was that the well cost back in that time period was substantially above $10 million apiece. I would say, mid to -- mid-teens would be a more normal occurrence back then. Over the course of the last few years, our team's quickly driven the costs down below $10 million. And we presently sit in around where we drill and complete the wells that you see on that sheet of paper for around $7 million or less. So a pretty dramatic improvement. It does move the play where it's generating competitive returns, but we'll have more to say about the Uinta on the road ahead. But very significant progress that's been made, large resource, and we're going to continue to work to drive value out of that basin."

I think the way I would think about it is you can see what the plan throws off when it gets 60 and above, throwing off a lot of cash. We're well hedged in the short term, so it comes down to how does the commodity move 2018, '19 and '20. So we're well protected to the downside in '18, which means that if prices were to fall lower, we don't have to adjust our plan materially in 2018. We'll keep our eyes open for signals from the market on what the right pace of activity is as the '19 and '20 pricing develops a little bit of clarity. I think you well know that the curves are backwardated today, and we're going to be judicious in terms of how we think about building our hedge book over time.

I think we and industry, because there's a lot of other wells on that sheet that are drilled by other companies. I think it proved that in spades, so I think all 3 of the intervals that we eliminated, the Sycamore, Caney and the Osage, that drilling activity, say that, that resource has been substantively derisked. I particularly like how the wells are dispersed around our acreage footprint, that gives you -- should give you as an investor an owner of confidence in that resource. The challenge then becomes the learnings as we go through these multiwell DSU developments with a focus on returns. The challenges for John Jasek and the teams on the operating front are going to be how to feather in additional work there and continue to work to progress those horizons so that we get the right projects at the front of the line. That's where we're going to be focused. And if it turned out that the right project at the front of the line is a Sycamore well, you'll hear us talking about Sycamore. We also mentioned the extensional work that was done, which I think is substantial North SCOOP, an area where EOG is coming in and drilled some wells as well. It's another new entrant. And that where we announced the 2,000-barrel a day, 30-day rate on the Larry well, I think is evidence of that. I think our teams have been patient. But we're focused on working really, really hard. Let's call it a sense of urgency to do the right things right and give the answers early, because it's important to get it early so that you get it right early. And that's one of the big challenges for our team. So we'll continue to juggle those investments. We're investing in some 80 wells and those horizons that were derisked with the 2017 program in the 3-year plan. And it would be my expectation that you'll see a shift over time to various parts of that portfolio depending upon returns, commodity mix, macro, all the things that we use to judge where we want to be drilling. But we're very pleased with what we've seen from the SCORE program. And I think it gives us good visibility on the entirety of the section that we need to be planning to develop, and we clearly achieved the objective expanding the resource. I think we got 3 billion barrels plus now in the Anadarko Basin alone."

Generally, we drilled 10,000-foot laterals everywhere we could. We drilled those laterals on opposite sides of the lease line to keep those wells close. That was coming in the early stages of kind of getting some indications what interference might look like over time. But the other thing it did for us is it left virtually 2 million -- not 2 million -- excuse me, 2 miles of undisturbed ground between that well and the next well that we drilled to HBP, the offsetting [ section ]. And we marched through the acreage in that way because we knew that we didn't know the answer. We knew we had the acreage in the HBP, we didn't know the answer about what the absolute final development spacing might be. We talked a lot over the last couple of years about the macro, prevailing commodity prices being part of the equation. We've talked about this being a 3-dimensional geometry problem that the team is working on. It has probably got a lot more dimensions than that when you think about completion mix and intensity and all the other things we're testing as well. But clearly, I think, we'll have a bias for developing to the fullest extent we can, the economically viable section of rock that we see in a particular DSU. And that's going to vary from location to location. We've got some ideas, and we've actually had some tests that we'll probably talk about over the course of this year that John and our team call interface tests. That's where we're drilling interface between Osage and Woodford. And we've had some interesting and encouraging results there. But that's all the setup. That development is being part of the ultimate development cube. So I think there's a lot, lot going on there, and we have some tests planned in '18 that will help us advance that ball in 2018."

And the part we were always careful to say is we're not -- we can certainly nod our head and say we see that, but we don't believe that the biggest job size is necessarily the right solution in development where you have to deal with other issues of drainage, interference, optimal vertical and lateral offset spacing. We really want to keep the stimulated rock volume, that of the high fracture intensity, as close to the wellbore as possible to maximize the recovery out of that stimulated rock volume. And I think with some of the larger wells, you've got to worry about reaching out farther and maybe causing issues for yourself in development mode.

And I understand all that stuff, and I know that splashy IPs are splashy IPs, and sometimes they don't really tell you what's ahead. Our team has done a lot of good work moving back to STACK. I think we've done similar work in the Williston Basin as well. But the Stark pad that was mentioned earlier and several times over the course of last year, one of the really cool things they did there is they didn't maximize the early production rates out of those wells, and now we're telling you about 100% return out of a 10-well DSU in the Meramec. Pretty exciting stuff. If you look at some of the early wells that were drilled around that area, and it'd be easy enough for you guys to find, you'll see some really high, splashy IP rates, but you also saw very high decline rates with those. So in places you have big IP rates and steep decline rates, then the reservoir engineers are probably going to get nervous in the world and wonder if they're doing more harm than good. So I just think that it's probably best that you guys keep asking your questions, but let's have some balanced discussion about this, particularly as we move into development, because those things that maybe were important to -- as the play was being derisked and unfolded in HBP, I believe, are going to be less and less important kind of on the road ahead.

We aggressively invested in multi-well DSUs. I mean, that was something we featured in 2017. And we were careful to say, we don't know what the answer is, but we're going to go aggressively test these multi-well DSUs and get the information. That was something that, I guess, we spent most of the first half of last year answering questions on. I can tell you now, looking backwards, I'm glad we did because we got a lot of great information. And the really cool thing is, most all of those were very, very positive, right, in terms of how they worked out. So we've got that information now to incorporate our development. That gives you confidence to say, hey, now we've -- this is not as uncertain as it might have been in the times past. We also feel that the macro environment is a little bit better, like 10% better, than we felt a year ago when we were planning around $50. And then the efficiency gains of the team demonstrated returns while the rest of that is just math at that point. So -- and we want to set a path. We're returns focused. We want double-digit growth inside of cash flow. We want it to be sustainable. That's kind of where our focus is. And I think we also did some cool things in '17 that are part of the forward plan in terms of completion intensity, frac intensity, et cetera, that I think if -- warrants some good results as well. So there are a lot of contributing factors, upsizing of the jobs over what we had previously. I think we designed the program around 2,100 x 2,100. Most of our wells that you see in '17 are of that intensity, just for reference."

I think that you can drill -- we see strong wells that we're participating in and drilling in. When you get into the wet gas condensate, volatile oil, black oil, if you just think of that portion of the portfolio, very strong returns across that -- those portions of the phase offload. That's true both in SCOOP as well as STACK. Generally, the deeper, higher pressured areas will have higher IPs, rates, EURs. They've also got generally higher well cost. So for us, it's just math, but we frankly like investments in all 3 of those regions. And I think that activity with industry over the course of the last couple years, particularly in the northern portion of the play STACK, we and our friends in the play have been largely focused on the wet gas condensate and volatile oil regime because with the prevailing macro, commodity prices, $45, $50 where we started that, that was the place you could go to get really strong returns. So I think you can see demonstrated in the play, the major operators, the focus has been on returns long before returns discussion became so popular as it is today. And then I referenced an example in the call of -- and that was a Jackson/Florene pad, that we put it well into the black oil window. And the Meramec wells that we added there are 90% returns. So -- but there has been a lot of discussion about it. I mean, look, I'll take higher pressure where you can get it. We're not afraid of lower pressure as long as you can drill good wells. I think there has been too much talk about pressures, the magic. I'm going to say something I've said for a lot of years. The magic is -- comes from the team.

Generally, if we're drilling gassier wells, it's because they're wet gas condensate or volatile oil. Most of the gas that we reference is coming from -- as an example, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '17, we talked about OBO, 10-well OBO DSU that had come online down the SCOOP and that was making in excess of 200 million cubic feet a day and I think we had 30-something percent working interest. That's all it took to skew the oil percentage in the quarter just a very small amount. So as you have these gassier multi-well pads, which are a lot like when we used to turn on offshore platforms coming on with big production rates, they're going to skew small percentage points one quarter to the next. But the key, go back to the comments on the -- earlier in the call is, are you generating high returns? And the answer is yes, we want our team to continue to invest in those. So it's just a function of where industry is drilling. Usually, they're HBP activities, some of this that could be taking place as well. We've got some extensional HBP work ourselves out to the Northwest. Some of that's a little bit gassier as well. But we're not chasing -- if you've heard anything today, we're not trying to absolutely manicure micro percentages on the various product mixes.

Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance along with additional color in our @NFX Publication.
Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results. For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver a 3-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.
Adjusting for unrealized revenue loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.
Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176.500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil.
We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin. Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here.
Our planned estimates net production as much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.
From a capital spending standpoint, we invested in $345 million in the quarter, which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned related to higher-than-expected activity levels from outside operators and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.
Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels and generating our 2018 growth outlook from $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices.
The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our planned period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that deliver strong growth -- strong and consistent growth within cash from operations. We're in the cusp of this achievement today.
Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we saw directly into Cushing by pipeline. During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales us in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our planned completion cadence.
In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells, including operated the nonoperated pilots to date have rapidly advancing the understanding of parent-child relationships and are showing variable item [indiscernible] to space and complete our PUD developments to optimize future returns.
We are living in this regard. In today's @NFX, we've provided updated performance on 4 of our spacing tests between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So don't forget the other [indiscernible] horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved pay out in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which was up about 25% year-over-year. 
In the Williston, we're delivering some of the industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expected to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.
Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have 3 lifts in the second quarter or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.
Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million with the addition of some new banking relationships up to $2 billion total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn.
Again, we're off to a great start to 2018, and we are focused on delivering our 3-year plan, which we laid out to you in detail in February. Our plan is to have a careful balance of capital discipline, net adjusted growth and production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics.
Thank you for your time today and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.

So if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields and a couple of higher condensate yields wells, all of which were very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and then STACK proper in terms of output and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the west. So this is consistent with the base envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as some OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter. We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage that was to secure [indiscernible] those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity and, from time to time, a need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. We've got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally, probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas, but with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition. Processing as well in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision due process, and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So we make the decision month-to-month and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So all of that' has been embedded in the update."

I spent 2 days in the field a little over a week ago in Oklahoma and I can tell you that everybody I've met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies and that tells us that the goals that we've said and communicated down where the rubber hits the road, I'm our proud of them, they're going to execute, making things happen [indiscernible] hit."

The margins that we have online right now, it's 6 wells per DSU. The [ Rottenburg ] is at 8 and our most recent, the STACKs and developed in June to 10 and 12 wells per DSU, these projects are delivering over 90% returns.

You can see the @NFX Publication, we've got additional pilots as we continue to spread out across the primary STACK footprint. My expectation is we'll continue to deliver strong results there and further derisk the planned forecast looking forward. I think all of that's positive. The fact that we're on track with regard to our efficiency gains coming into this year, I think is positive as well. And the fact that we're not seeing the type of inflationary pressures that we saw through to last year is also  a positive. At the end of the day, a lot of work went into the 3-year plan. I think our team has been consistently right in terms of how it's forecast and how it's protected the play was going to evolve. We did take a position in terms of not driving the type curve up, we're in HBP mode and counseling people that we get into development mode. The wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. These results demonstrate that our team was embedding that all day long. Like most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. Good plays tend to get better over time. Great teams tend to make break plays even better.

So we drilled multi-will DSUs, high density DSUs that were executed last year. One of the flags that they had put out for us was that there seem to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally will think that, that's space related. So they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing the pressure distribution and the reservoir system and it appears to be paying really good dividends. We're seeing consistent sustained performance there. So I think that's a good product of technical team, asset team doing a really, really good technical work. We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated that by ourselves and industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well. I think we counseled consistently that, that didn't mean the most proppant, the most fluid was the most best well to drill in development mode. So we've taken a different attack there.

I think the challenge for us is to overcome on the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February, and we think the price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard.

And so we made moves ahead of that, get our gas out of basin price into the southeast and when you look at that by the end of this year in October, we'll have another 160 million, bringing us to 205 million cubic feet a day on enable, that along with about 70 million cubic feet that's going to the Midwest, we'll take 2/3 of our gas out of the basin, and we will have both those contracts in place. We have some physical hedges that's going to advantages us over the next few years. So when you look at Newfield, we've had a great run this quarter comparing our [ depths ] to that of our competitors. When you look out 2019 and 2020, we'll continue to have some advantage. Although that'll pull down a little bit at some of the physical hedges for a while."

So in our view, we're focused on returns. It is a mix. So we think it's a thoughtful mix, understanding what the investors demand and want today. We want to demonstrate capital discipline, strong returns that adjusted production and cash flow growth that I referenced, then I'll say again, like I said in February, it's the right plan for NFX and we're committed to delivering it. So we've got a long track record in that regard. It's something we take seriously. We're going to work every day to give you some color. I guarantee, every man and women in Newfield listening to this call right now, they show up everyday and beat the plan. This magic that they create doesn't just happen, okay? They've got to do lots of little things. It's little wins that get -- that take plays day by day, hour by hour. I'll never bet against them. I'm going to advise outside not to bet against them. We're going to deliver this plan and we'll find ways to optimize it over time. No doubt about that. And I think the only thing I would say is keep your eye on the ball, 2020. We're signed up for 200,000 BOE per day of production coming out of the Anadarko Basin. And so really, really strong growth trajectory there and a lot of superbly execution as it takes place in delivery."

If we were the only company playing in the STACK Play, and you had infinite approvals, and you didn't have to do all the things you have to do to get regulatory approval to drill, you can turn on a dime. The fact of the matter is the team has to stay in touch with offset operators. You've got to manage for frac bashing and things that occur in that regard. I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko. But every other play is going to face some of those same challenges, kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP. So we're in a good place there. So we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part, into pure develop moment as you get to 2019 forward. I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you a high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan. We are hydrating. Hydrating to drill the best highest returns. We make adjustments realtime during the course of the year. So to the extent that the team is able to take advantage of learnings and shift capital, they do it. And they'll continue to do that through the course of the plan period. Our focus today is we'll continue to hydrate, make sure we get the highest return opportunities in front of the line.

These are all things that we've got baked into our plans. They -- many of these things have already been anticipated. But the fact of the matter remains the Bakken remains some of the best returns, most productive wells that we have and just about anybody's portfolio and in a million dollars-barrel EURs and these costs are being drilled and oftentimes less than $6 million.

That's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So we've -- it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill an HBP, those leases. So that's really what the focus was in the 4 wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity that people have HBP-ed acreage footprint, preserving an option, value option for the future, and we don't plan to develop, follow-up on any of this stage in development mode. If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that, which is kind of the area we call Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So we'll get that acreage HBP-ed. So that's something that is proportionate to the capital this year that's not committed directly to the development. It's a good economic decision and those wells those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out. So we feel very good about that. Beyond that, you kind of -- to have proper or Eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see, when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots, that we get finished with the next 3 that we've got in line. We'll have drilled multiwell DSUs in the Meramec across the substantive footprint in that Eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up the development drilling in the 3-year plan. So I think that's where most of the activity is focused in STACK. And certainly, that activity will grow in '19 and '20 as we go into full development mode. And then, of course, we do have some activity down in SCOOP play as well and a portion of that is tied to North SCOOP where we've got 1 rig running in that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year and then that'll become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage. We're focused on developing Woodford. So most of the capital is going to development, but those 2 areas kind of give you some color with the pressures that the team face day to day. I think we're making good decisions, and again, when you drilling strong economic results on HBP mode, it's never a bad thing. We'll take it."

Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.Let's jump right in with a",910,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in this morning. Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.
Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results. For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates, and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver a 3-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.
Adjusting for unrealized derivative loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.
Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil.
We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin. Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here. Our planned estimates net production was much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.
From a capital spending standpoint, we invested $345 million in the quarter, which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned related to higher-than-expected activity levels from outside operators and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.
Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels and generating our 2018 growth outlook from $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel, and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices.
The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our planned period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that deliver strong growth and -- strong and consistent growth within cash flow from operations. We're in the cusp of this achievement today.
Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year, and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year, and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we saw directly into Cushing by pipeline. During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our planned completion cadence. In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells, including operated and non-operated pilots to date, have rapidly advanced our understanding of parent-child relationships and are shedding valuable light on how best to space and complete our pad developments to optimize future returns. We are leading in this regard. 
In today's @NFX, we've provided updated performance on 4 of our spacing tests between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So don't forget the other prolific horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved payout in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which is up about 25% year-over-year. In the Williston, we are delivering some of the industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expected to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.
Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have 3 liftings in the second quarter or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.
Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million, with the addition of some new banking relationships up to $2 billion total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn.
Again, we're off to a great start in 2018, and we are focused on delivering our 3-year plan, which we laid out to you in detail in February. Our plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt adjusted growth and production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics.
Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.

I'm going to go ahead and say -- make a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary shed some light. So if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields and a couple of higher condensate yield wells, all of which were very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and then STACK proper in terms of our footprint and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the west. So this is consistent with the phase envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as some OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter. We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage. That was to secure HBP those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity and, from time to time, need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. We've got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas. But with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition. Processing as well in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision due process, and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So we make the decision month-to-month, and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So all of that has been embedded in the update."

At this point, we're focused on our 3-year plan and delivering what we signed up for in February. As far as pressure is on the cost side, we continue to see minimal inflation pressures in the Anadarko Basin. And CapEx spend has, likewise, been in line with expectations in that regard. Learning curve assumptions are built into the 3-year plan, and we're on track with the learning curves as well. So I think from an operating standpoint, we continue to execute extraordinarily well. I spent 2 days in the field a little over a week ago in Oklahoma, and I can tell you that everybody I met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies.

And our most recent, the Starks and the Velta June, 10 and 12 wells per DSU. These projects are delivering over 90% returns. So -- and these are some of the fullest developed sections that we've seen to date and the most tightest. So I think this is not luck.

We set it up for development. The team invested aggressively in multi-well DSUs last year. Those are the results that we're framing our decisions today on how to optimize this development on the road ahead, and some of those are contributing as well to the cost efficiencies that we're going to drive during the course of the 3-year plan."

I think the DSUs that I referenced earlier where we have substantial performance to date were all performing extraordinarily well. The fact that you're running on those slightly above the 1.3 million barrel average that we embedded in the 3-year plan, that should be encouraging to everybody. But I'm -- I'll remind everyone that it's still early innings. You can see in the @NFX Publication, we've got additional pilots as we continue to spread out across the primary STACK footprint. My expectation is we'll continue to deliver strong results there and further derisk the planned forecast looking forward. I think all of that's positive. The fact that we're on track with regard to our efficiency gains coming into this year, I think, is positive as well. And the fact that we're not seeing the type of inflationary pressures that we suffered through last year is also a positive. At the end of the day, a lot of work went into that 3-year plan. I think our team has been consistently right in terms of how it's forecast and how it's predicted the play was going to evolve. We did take a position in terms of not driving the type curve up. We're in HBP mode and counseling people that when you get into the development mode and the wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. I think these results demonstrate that our team was embedding that all the way along. Now even most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. Good plays tend to get better over time. Great teams tend to make great plays even better. And that's what our team has done. That's what we're going to do.

We've been working that into our game plan on these DSUs, and we drilled multi-well DSUs, high density DSUs that were executed last year. One of the flags that they had put out was that there seem to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally will think that, that's space-related. So they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing pressure distribution and the reservoir system. And it appears to be paying really good dividends, and we're seeing consistent sustained performance there. So I think that's a good product of technical team, asset team doing a really, really good technical work. We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated by ourselves and industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well. I think we counseled consistently that, that didn't mean that the most proppant and the most fluid was the best well to drill in development mode. So we've taken a different attack there.

But at $55, it's $300 million-plus free cash flow for the 3-year plan period. And at $60-plus, it was $1 billion. So those were the -- the assumptions are embedded in the plan. Ultimately, the product of all the things that we've been talking about this morning, including price, the actual funnel price path, will determine the final outcome. But as far as the trajectory, I would say that from an operating standpoint, we're still strong. I think the challenge for us is to overcome the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February, and we think the price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard. So I'd say taxes in the first quarter prospectively are a headwind relative to the planned, and oil is a tailwind. As we think about it, we think everything is working to where we'll be able to offset that in the course of the 3-year plan period."

And ultimately, we're sitting at an effective 6 wells per Meramec based on the spacing that was included. We applied all learnings that we had, had from the Velta June. And this is -- at the end of the day, those -- what we've got from the Jackson and Florenes were ultimately applied in the Margies, where we're sitting at 6 wells, and really like the results that we're seeing out of the Margies thus far.

Thanks, Lee. Yes, as far as the natural gas takeaways, primarily driven by the Enable transportation agreement, when you look at that, we saw a couple of years ago the possibility that we'd see, kind of basis issues forming not only in Anadarko but with other basins. And so we made moves ahead of that, get our gas out of basin price into the southeast. And when you look at that by the end of this year in October, we'll have another 160 million, bringing us to 205 million cubic feet a day on Enable. That -- along with about 70 million cubic feet that's going to the Midwest, we'll take 2/3 of our gas out of the basin, and we will have both those contracts in place. We have some physical hedges that's going to advantage us over the next few years. So when you look at Newfield, we've had a great run this quarter comparing our depths to that of our competitors.

We want to demonstrate capital discipline, strong returns, debt adjusted production and cash flow growth that I referenced.

And so really, really strong growth trajectory there and a lot of superlative execution as it take place in delivery."

If we were the only company playing in the STACK play and you had infinite approvals and you didn't have to do all the things you do to get regulatory approval to drill, you can turn on a dime. But the fact of the matter is the team has to stay in touch with offset operators, you've got to manage for frac bashing and things that occur in that regard. I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko. But every other play is going to face some of those same challenges kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP, so we're in a good place there. So we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part into pure develop moment as you get to 2019 forward. I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you a high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan. We are hydrating, hydrating to drill the best highest returns. We make adjustments real time during the course of the year. So to the extent that the team is able to take advantage of learnings and shift capital, they do it, and they'll continue to do that through the course of the plan period. Our focus today is we'll continue to hydrate, make sure we get the highest return opportunities at the front of the line, get the final HBP pushed behind us and keep our eye on the ball of getting to free cash flow generation as quickly as possible."

What you asked about as far as there are constraints developing in the basin, I think they've been widely reported. The -- it looks like we may have some relief on the flaring side. These are all things that we've got baked into our plans. They -- many of these things have already been anticipated. But the fact of the matter remains -- the Bakken remains some of the best returns, most productive wells that we have and just about anybody's portfolio in a million barrel EURs, and these wells are being drilled and oftentimes less than $6 million.

So the wells out to the west, the HBP wells, that's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So we've -- it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill and HBP those leases. So that's really what the focus was on the 4 wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area, and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity that people have HBP-ed acreage footprint, such as preserving an option, value option for the future. And we don't plan to develop, follow-up on any of these at this stage in development mode. If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that, which is kind of the area we call Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive, and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So we'll get that acreage HBP-ed. So that's something that is a portion of the capital. This year, that's not committed directly to development. It's good economic decision, and those wells are -- those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out there. So we feel very good about that. Beyond that, coming back to STACK proper or Eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots that we could finish with the next 3 that we've got in line. We'll have drilled multi-well DSUs in the Meramec across the substantive footprint in that Eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up, the development drilling in the 3-year plan. So I think that's where most all of the activity is focused in STACK. And certainly, that activity will grow in '19 and '20 as we go into full development mode. And then of course, we do have some activity down in SCOOP play as well, and a portion of that is tied to North SCOOP where we've got one rig running, and that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year, and then that'll become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage. We're focused on developing Woodford. So most of the capital going to development, but those 2 areas kind of give you some color with the pressures that the team face day to day. And I think they're making good decisions. And again when you're going strong, economic results on HBP mode, it's never a bad thing. We'll take it."

Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.Let's jump right in with a",912,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in this morning. Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.
Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results. For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates, and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver our 3-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.
Adjusting for unrealized derivative loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.
Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil.
We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin. Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here. Our plan estimates net production of as much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.
From a capital spending standpoint, we invested $345 million in the quarter, which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned related to higher-than-expected activity levels from outside operators and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.
Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels and generating our 2018 growth outlook for $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel, and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices.
The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our planned period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that delivers strong growth and -- strong and consistent growth within cash flow from operations. We're on the cusp of this achievement today.
Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year, and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year, and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we sell directly into Cushing by pipeline. During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our plan completion cadence. In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells, including operated and non-operated pilots to date, have rapidly advanced our understanding of parent-child relationships and are shedding valuable light on how best to space and complete our pad developments to optimize future returns. We are leading in this regard. 
In today's @NFX, we've provided updated performance on 4 of our spacing tests between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So don't forget the other prolific horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved payout in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which is up about 25% year-over-year. In the Williston, we are delivering some of the industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expect it to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.
Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have 3 liftings in the second quarter, or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.
Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million with the addition of some new banking relationships, up to $2 billion total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn.
Again, we're off to a great start in 2018, and we are focused on delivering our 3-year plan, which we laid out for you in detail in February. Our plan has a careful balance of capital discipline, debt adjusted growth and production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics.
Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.
Operator, we're now ready for questions."

I'm going to go ahead and say -- make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary shed some light. So if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields, and a couple of higher condensate yield wells, all of which were very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and then STACK proper in terms of our footprint and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the west. So this is consistent with the phase envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as some OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter. We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage. That was to secure HBP, those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity and, from time to time, a need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. We've got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas. But with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition. Processing, as well, in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision to process, and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So we make the decision month-to-month, and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So all of that has been embedded in the update."

We certainly recognize that the commodity has come up, and that's certainly beneficial. The curve, overall, is still backward-dated, and we've got a substantial hedge position in place for 2018. So I think that we've got a solid plan around those assumptions. We'll continue to monitor price. And sometime in the future, if the market conditions dictate, then we could consider a change. At this point, we're focused on our 3-year plan and delivering what we signed up for in February. As far as pressures on the cost side, we continue to see minimal inflation pressures in the Anadarko Basin. And CapEx spend has, likewise, been in line with expectations in that regard. Learning curve assumptions are built into the 3-year plan, and we're on track with the learning curves as well. So I think -- from an operating standpoint, I think the teams are executing extraordinarily well. I spent 2 days in the field a little over a week ago, in Oklahoma, and I can tell you that everybody I met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies.

And our most recent, the Starks and the Velta Junes are 10 and 12 wells per DSU. These projects are delivering over 90% returns. So -- and these are some of the fullest developed sections that we've seen to date and the most tightest. So I think this is not luck. I think from what's been reported, this is truly differentiating about some of the techniques that we're using. And at the end of the day, it's really all coming down to some of the targeting techniques we've used. We're optimizing our chemical treatments.

The fact that we're on track with regard to our efficiency gains coming into this year, I think, is positive as well. And the fact that we're not seeing the type of inflationary pressures that we suffered through last year is also a positive. At the end of the day, a lot of work went into that 3-year plan. I think our team has been consistently right in terms of how it's forecast and how it's predicted the play was going to evolve. We did take a position in terms of not driving the type curve up. When we're in HBP mode, I'm counseling people that when you get into development mode that -- and the wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. I think these results demonstrate that our team was embedding that all the way along. I think most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. Good plays tend to get better over time. Great teams tend to make great plays even better. And that's what our team has done. That's what we're going to do.

When we drilled the multi-well DSUs, high-density DSUs that were executed last year, one of the flags that they had put up was that there seemed to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally would think that, that's phase-related. So they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing pressure distribution and the reservoir system. And it appears to be paying really good dividends. We're seeing consistent sustained performance there. So I think that's a good product of the technical team, asset team doing a really, really good technical work. We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated that -- by ourselves and the industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well.

As Lee suggested, what we've learned in the Velta June, where we've actually experimented with many different proppant fluid loadings, we've learned a lot from that. I would tell you we're testing some slightly less intense fracs out there today, and we're monitoring their performance and see if that's an opportunity where, basically, we can continue to become more capitally efficient and drive F&D and not materially, if at all, even affect the type curve. So we think there's some opportunities here, but it's really still early at this point to say that we've defined what the optimum is."

Ultimately, the product of all the things that we've been talking about this morning, including price, the actual final price path, will determine the final outcome. But as far as the trajectory, I would say that from an operating standpoint, we're still strong. I think the challenge for us is to overcome the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February. And we think price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard. So I'd say taxes in the first quarter prospectively are a headwind relative to the planned, and oil is a tailwind.

If we were the only company playing in the STACK play and you had infinite approvals, and you didn't have to do all the things you do to get regulatory approval to drill, you could turn on a dime. But the fact of the matter is the team has to stay in touch with offset operators, you've got to manage for frac bashing and things that occur in that regard. I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko. But every other play is going to face some of those same challenges kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP, so we're in a good place there. So we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part into pure development as you get to 2019 forward. And I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan. We are high-grading -- are high-grading to drill the best highest returns. We make adjustments real time during the course of the year.

So the wells out to the west, the HBP wells, that's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So we've -- it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill and HBP those leases. So that's really what the focus was on the 4 wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area, and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity, that people have HBP-ed acreage footprints, which is preserving an option, a value option for the future. And we don't plan to develop, follow-up on any of these at this stage in development mode. If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that, which is kind of the area we call the Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So the Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive, and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So we'll get that acreage HBP-ed. So that's something that is a portion of the capital this year that's not committed directly to development. It's a good economic decision, and those wells are -- those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out there. So we feel really good about that. Beyond that, you come back to STACK proper, or Eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see, when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots, that we get finish with the next 3 that we've got in line, we'll have drilled multi-well DSUs in the Meramec across a substantive footprint in that eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up the development drilling in the 3-year plan. So I think that's where most all of the activity is focused in STACK. And certainly, that activity will grow in '19 and '20 as we go into full development mode. And then of course, we do have some activity down in the SCOOP play as well, and a portion of that is tied to North SCOOP where we've got one rig running, and that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year, and then that'll become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage. We're focused on developing Woodford. So most of the capital going to development, but those 2 areas kind of give you some color of the pressures that the team face day to day.

Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.Let's jump right in with a",912,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in this morning. Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.
Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results. For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates, and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver our 3-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.
Adjusting for unrealized derivative loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.
Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil.
We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin. Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here. Our plan estimates net production of as much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.
From a capital spending standpoint, we invested $345 million in the quarter, which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned related to higher-than-expected activity levels from outside operators and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.
Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels and generating our 2018 growth outlook for $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel, and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices.
The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our planned period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that delivers strong growth and -- strong and consistent growth within cash flow from operations. We're on the cusp of this achievement today.
Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year, and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year, and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we sell directly into Cushing by pipeline. During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our plan completion cadence. In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells, including operated and non-operated pilots to date, have rapidly advanced our understanding of parent-child relationships and are shedding valuable light on how best to space and complete our pad developments to optimize future returns. We are leading in this regard. 
In today's @NFX, we've provided updated performance on 4 of our spacing tests between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So don't forget the other prolific horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved payout in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which is up about 25% year-over-year. In the Williston, we are delivering some of the industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expect it to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.
Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have 3 liftings in the second quarter, or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.
Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million with the addition of some new banking relationships, up to $2 billion total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn.
Again, we're off to a great start in 2018, and we are focused on delivering our 3-year plan, which we laid out for you in detail in February. Our plan has a careful balance of capital discipline, debt adjusted growth and production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics.
Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.

I'm going to go ahead and say -- make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary shed some light. So if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields, and a couple of higher condensate yield wells, all of which were very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and then STACK proper in terms of our footprint and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the west. So this is consistent with the phase envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as some OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter. We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage. That was to secure HBP, those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity and, from time to time, a need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. We've got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas. But with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition. Processing, as well, in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision to process, and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So we make the decision month-to-month, and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So all of that has been embedded in the update."

So I think that we've got a solid plan around those assumptions. We'll continue to monitor price. And sometime in the future, if the market conditions dictate, then we could consider a change. At this point, we're focused on our 3-year plan and delivering what we signed up for in February. As far as pressures on the cost side, we continue to see minimal inflation pressures in the Anadarko Basin. And CapEx spend has, likewise, been in line with expectations in that regard. Learning curve assumptions are built into the 3-year plan, and we're on track with the learning curves as well. So I think -- from an operating standpoint, I think the teams are executing extraordinarily well. I spent 2 days in the field a little over a week ago, in Oklahoma, and I can tell you that everybody I met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies.

And our most recent, the Starks and the Velta Junes are 10 and 12 wells per DSU. These projects are delivering over 90% returns. So -- and these are some of the fullest developed sections that we've seen to date and the most tightest. So I think this is not luck. I think from what's been reported, this is truly differentiating about some of the techniques that we're using. And at the end of the day, it's really all coming down to some of the targeting techniques we've used. We're optimizing our chemical treatments.

When we're in HBP mode, I'm counseling people that when you get into development mode that -- and the wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. I think these results demonstrate that our team was embedding that all the way along. I think most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. Good plays tend to get better over time. Great teams tend to make great plays even better. And that's what our team has done. That's what we're going to do. I think I'll reference the Bakken as the most recent example. But I think in each play that we've deployed capital and talent, our team has managed to exceed expectations."

I think one of the things that I've really been pleased with in terms of our team is as they've evaluated the data over the last couple of years, that's our data and all of the data operated by others, we've been working that into our game plan on these DSUs. When we drilled the multi-well DSUs, high-density DSUs that were executed last year, one of the flags that they had put up was that there seemed to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally would think that, that's phase-related. So they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing pressure distribution and the reservoir system. And it appears to be paying really good dividends. We're seeing consistent sustained performance there. So I think that's a good product of the technical team, asset team doing a really, really good technical work. We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated that -- by ourselves and the industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well. I think we counseled consistently that, that didn't mean that the most proppant and the most fluid was the best well to drill in development mode. And so we've taken a different tack there. And I'll flip it over to Gary. He can give you some color of the operations on the ground."

I would tell you we're testing some slightly less intense fracs out there today, and we're monitoring their performance and see if that's an opportunity where, basically, we can continue to become more capitally efficient and drive F&D and not materially, if at all, even affect the type curve.

Ultimately, the product of all the things that we've been talking about this morning, including price, the actual final price path, will determine the final outcome. But as far as the trajectory, I would say that from an operating standpoint, we're still strong. I think the challenge for us is to overcome the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February. And we think price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard. So I'd say taxes in the first quarter prospectively are a headwind relative to the planned, and oil is a tailwind.

I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko. But every other play is going to face some of those same challenges kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP, so we're in a good place there. So we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part into pure development as you get to 2019 forward. And I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan.

What you asked about as far as there are constraints developing in the basin. I think they've been widely reported. The -- it looks like we may have some relief on the flaring side. These are all things that we've got baked into our plans. These -- many of these things have already been anticipated. But the fact of the matter remains -- the Bakken remains some of the best returns, most productive wells that we have in just about anybody's portfolio, at a million barrel EURs, and these wells are being drilled in, oftentimes, less than $6 million. It has had a great place in our portfolio, and it continues to define greater confidence that we have in our plan coming out of the basin."

So the wells out to the west, the HBP wells, that's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So we've -- it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill and HBP those leases. So that's really what the focus was on the 4 wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area, and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity, that people have HBP-ed acreage footprints, which is preserving an option, a value option for the future. And we don't plan to develop, follow-up on any of these at this stage in development mode. If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that, which is kind of the area we call the Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So the Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive, and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So we'll get that acreage HBP-ed. So that's something that is a portion of the capital this year that's not committed directly to development. It's a good economic decision, and those wells are -- those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out there. So we feel really good about that. Beyond that, you come back to STACK proper, or Eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see, when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots, that we get finish with the next 3 that we've got in line, we'll have drilled multi-well DSUs in the Meramec across a substantive footprint in that eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up the development drilling in the 3-year plan. So I think that's where most all of the activity is focused in STACK. And certainly, that activity will grow in '19 and '20 as we go into full development mode. And then of course, we do have some activity down in the SCOOP play as well, and a portion of that is tied to North SCOOP where we've got one rig running, and that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year, and then that'll become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage. We're focused on developing Woodford. So most of the capital going to development, but those 2 areas kind of give you some color of the pressures that the team face day to day. And I think they're making good decisions. And again, when you're drilling strong economic results on HBP mode, it's never a bad thing. We'll take it."

Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.Let's jump right in with a",912,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in this morning. Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance, along with additional color, in our @NFX Publication.
Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results. For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates, and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver our 3-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.
Adjusting for unrealized derivative loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.
Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil.
We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin. Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here. Our plan estimates net production of as much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.
From a capital spending standpoint, we invested $345 million in the quarter, which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned related to higher-than-expected activity levels from outside operators and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.
Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels and generating our 2018 growth outlook for $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel, and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices.
The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our planned period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that delivers strong growth and -- strong and consistent growth within cash flow from operations. We're on the cusp of this achievement today.
Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year, and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year, and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we sell directly into Cushing by pipeline. During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our plan completion cadence. In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells, including operated and non-operated pilots to date, have rapidly advanced our understanding of parent-child relationships and are shedding valuable light on how best to space and complete our pad developments to optimize future returns. We are leading in this regard. 
In today's @NFX, we've provided updated performance on 4 of our spacing tests between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So don't forget the other prolific horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved payout in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which is up about 25% year-over-year. In the Williston, we are delivering some of the industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expect it to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.
Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have 3 liftings in the second quarter, or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.
Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million with the addition of some new banking relationships, up to $2 billion total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn.
Again, we're off to a great start in 2018, and we are focused on delivering our 3-year plan, which we laid out for you in detail in February. Our plan has a careful balance of capital discipline, debt adjusted growth and production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics.
Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.

I'm going to go ahead and say -- make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary shed some light. So if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields and a couple of higher condensate yield wells, all of which were very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and then STACK proper in terms of our footprint and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the west. So this is consistent with the phase envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as some OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter. We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage. That was to secure HBP, those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity and, from time to time, a need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. We've got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas. But with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition. Processing as well in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision to process, and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So we make the decision month-to-month, and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So all of that has been embedded in the update."

At this point, we're focused on our 3-year plan and delivering what we signed up for in February. As far as pressures on the cost side, we continue to see minimal inflation pressures in the Anadarko Basin. And CapEx spend has, likewise, been in line with expectations in that regard. Learning curve assumptions are built into the 3-year plan, and we're on track with the learning curves as well. So I think -- from an operating standpoint, I think the teams are executing extraordinarily well. I spent 2 days in the field a little over a week ago in Oklahoma, and I can tell you that everybody I met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies.

I think from what's been reported, this is truly differentiating about some of the techniques that we're using. And at the end of the day, it's really all coming down to some of the targeting techniques we've used. We're optimizing our chemical treatments. We look at how we're -- our cluster spacing, how we're advancing some of the profit designs we have. It's pretty exciting, but I think it's still too early at this point to go ahead and identify what is the single spacing that we're on to."

And I can assure you, they are definitely not luck and not an accident. It's a result of a lot of good work by our team. We've been planning for development since the day we started out here. We set it up for development. The team invested aggressively in multi-well DSUs last year. Those are the results that are framing our decisions today on how to optimize this development on the road ahead, and some of those are contributing as well to the cost efficiencies that we're going to drive during the course of the 3-year plan."

I think the DSUs that I referenced earlier, where we have substantial performance to date are all performing extraordinarily well. The fact that you're running on those slightly above the 1.3 million barrel average that we embedded in the 3-year plan, that should be encouraging to everybody. But I'm -- I'll remind everyone that it's still early innings. You can see in the @NFX Publication, we've got additional pilots as we continue to spread out across the primary STACK footprint. My expectation is we'll continue to deliver strong results there and further derisk the plan forecast looking forward. I think all of that's positive. The fact that we're on track with regard to our efficiency gains coming into this year, I think, is positive as well. And the fact that we're not seeing the type of inflationary pressures that we suffered through last year is also a positive. At the end of the day, a lot of work went into that 3-year plan. I think our team has been consistently right in terms of how it's forecast and how it's predicted the play was going to evolve. We did take a position in terms of not driving the type curve up. When we're in HBP mode, I'm counseling people that when you get into development mode that -- and the wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. I think these results demonstrate that our team was embedding that all the way along. I think most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. Good plays tend to get better over time. Great teams tend to make great plays even better. And that's what our team has done. That's what we're going to do. I think I'll reference the Bakken as the most recent example. But I think in each play that we've deployed capital and talent, our team has managed to exceed expectations."

I think one of the things that I've really been pleased with in terms of our team is as they've evaluated the data over the last couple of years, that's our data and all of the data operated by others, we've been working that into our game plan on these DSUs. When we drilled the multi-well DSUs, high-density DSUs that were executed last year, one of the flags that they had put up was that there seemed to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally would think that, that's phase-related. So they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing pressure distribution and the reservoir system. And it appears to be paying really good dividends. We're seeing consistent sustained performance there. So I think that's a good product of the technical team, asset team doing a really, really good technical work. We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated that -- by ourselves and the industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well. I think we counseled consistently that, that didn't mean that the most proppant and the most fluid was the best well to drill in development mode. And so we've taken a different tack there. And I'll flip it over to Gary. He can give you some color of the operations on the ground."

I would tell you we're testing some slightly less intense fracs out there today, and we're monitoring their performance and see if that's an opportunity where, basically, we can continue to become more capitally efficient and drive F&D and not materially, if at all, even affect the type curve.

Ultimately, the product of all the things that we've been talking about this morning, including price, the actual final price path, will determine the final outcome. But as far as the trajectory, I would say that from an operating standpoint, we're still strong. I think the challenge for us is to overcome the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February, and we think price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard.

And we're not trying to be used car salesmen here. I think that we've taken a prudent approach. I think that, as I mentioned earlier,",329,"Well, I think that we signed up for the 3-year plan that we put forth, and we take our commitment in that regard serious. And we're not trying to be used car salesmen here. I think that we've taken a prudent approach. I think that, as I mentioned earlier, the plan as constructed is a careful balance of all of the things that we divined from lots of meetings with better than 50% of our ownership during the course of the 12 months preceding the plan. So in our view, we're focused on returns. It is a mix. So we think it's a thoughtful mix of understanding what the investors demand and want today. We want to demonstrate capital discipline, strong returns, debt adjusted production and cash flow growth that I referenced. And I'll say again, I think I said it in February, it's the right plan for NFX, and we're committed to delivering it. So we've got a long track record in that regard. It's something we take seriously. We're going to work every day, to give you some color. I guarantee you, every man and woman at Newfield listening to this call right now, they show up every day to beat the plan. And this magic that they create doesn't just happen, okay? They've got to do lots of little things. It's little wins that get -- that take place day by day, hour by hour. I'll never bet against them, and I'm going to advise everybody outside not to bet against them. We're going to deliver this plan, and we'll find ways to optimize it over time. No doubt about that. And I think the other thing I would say is keep your eye on the ball. 2020, we're signed up for 200,000 BOE per day of production coming out of the Anadarko Basin. And it's a really, really strong growth trajectory there, and a lot of superlative execution has to take place to delivery it."

So there's lots of activity going on. If we were the only company playing in the STACK play and you had infinite approvals, and you didn't have to do all the things you do to get regulatory approval to drill, you could turn on a dime. But the fact of the matter is the team has to stay in touch with offset operators, you've got to manage for frac bashing and things that occur in that regard. I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko. But every other play is going to face some of those same challenges kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP, so we're in a good place there. So we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part into pure development as you get to 2019 forward. And I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan. We are high-grading -- are high-grading to drill the best highest returns. We make adjustments real time during the course of the year. So to the extent that the team is able to take advantage of learnings and shift capital, they do it, and they'll continue to do that through the course of the plan period. Our focus today is continue to high-grade, make sure we get the highest return opportunities at the front of the line, get the final HBP push behind us and keep our eye on the ball of getting to free cash flow generation as quickly as possible."

These are all things that we've got baked into our plans. These -- many of these things have already been anticipated. But the fact of the matter remains -- the Bakken remains some of the best returns, most productive wells that we have in just about anybody's portfolio, at a million barrel EURs, and these wells are being drilled in, oftentimes, less than $6 million.

So the wells out to the west, the HBP wells, that's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So we've -- it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill and HBP those leases. So that's really what the focus was on the 4 wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area, and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity, that people have HBP-ed acreage footprints, which is preserving an option, a value option for the future. And we don't plan to develop, follow-up on any of these at this stage in development mode. If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that, which is kind of the area we call the Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So the Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive, and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So we'll get that acreage HBP-ed. So that's something that is a portion of the capital this year that's not committed directly to development. It's a good economic decision, and those wells are -- those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out there. So we feel really good about that. Beyond that, you come back to STACK proper, or Eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see, when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots, that we get finish with the next 3 that we've got in line, we'll have drilled multi-well DSUs in the Meramec across a substantive footprint in that eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up the development drilling in the 3-year plan. So I think that's where most all of the activity is focused in STACK. And certainly, that activity will grow in '19 and '20 as we go into full development mode. And then of course, we do have some activity down in the SCOOP play as well, and a portion of that is tied to North SCOOP where we've got one rig running, and that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year, and then that'll become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage. We're focused on developing Woodford. So most of the capital going to development, but those 2 areas kind of give you some color of the pressures that the team face day to day. And I think they're making good decisions. And again, when you're drilling strong economic results on HBP mode, it's never a bad thing. We'll take it."

Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield posted solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth and domestic production was up more than 30%. Beat was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our second quarter production, SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. [ That ] liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. We've also participated in some gassier and nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date, just led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term.  
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. 
And at @NFX please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. Here today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multiwell development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refinery bids for our oils strengthen in June and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Cap investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger than anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. We see the exclamation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. We are continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infield pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we operated, participated in or traded for. We know have information on about 135 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole in every replay where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we are all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion jobs size on the Number 2 well, or the well closest to the parent and seeing improved results. 
The control flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term all production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery and ultimately, net present value. We find to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP approximately 24,000 net acres located in Northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turned to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate your efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

We've got offset production performance, we had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think, when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book to the balance of the year as we roll into '19, we dropped substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so. And we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year and certainly, ahead of schedule relative to the plan. As far as what we will do on the road ahead, with regard to the free cash flow, obviously we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest. But we're going to consider all the options as cash builds on the balance sheet, distribution, buybacks as well as adding filling activity in higher return areas as warranted. The goal is to get to free cash and we'll make the right decision as we see this sustainability in that area."

So there will be from time to time some impacts, mostly on timing, so there's timing uncertainty but we're confident when we look at the mix of timing and outcome that we can deliver the volumes, we're going to stay focused on delivering the 2018 volumes.

That's what you're seeing in today's guidance, nonop was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil as compared to the numbers that we post. So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than that acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got on an operated production, 7% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OVO. So these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and nonop, told folks in the first half of this year. It's never a bad thing when people want to drill wells on acreage that you own. So we're pretty pleased with the OBO results and we've got a great set of partners out there.

So we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color. But the early, early returns are positive. So we've been able to pressure up and/or refrac parent wells and bring those wells back online, successfully. We've also been able with the upsizing our reference in the Number 2 well, create pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along these lines, and leaving large swats of acreage, largely untouched. I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and let's say the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there's any variability in terms of the reservoir as we move across the acreage footprint. With those completion intensities, would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we've made the discovery. I think that's a big part of the difference.

Obviously, if we weren't delivering results, strong results consistent with the plan, then we wouldn't have posted the strong first half. So I think the first thing is that all of the assumptions are attained built or intact with regard to performance to the first half of the year. Clearly, we talked about the gas and NGL component. I think it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in the realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So that decision in it of itself drive some of those volumes, but it's also a good outcome in terms of where we think about the economics and cash flow, kind of across the portfolio. I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated  and went into the plan. I think most importantly we referenced in the call as we've got 5 or 6 multiwell DSUs that are inset into the central portion of our footprint, distributed along strike, that really -- those -- the results of those multiwell issues will underpin our 3-year plans. So that second half of the year, watching those results well it's going to be a pretty critical, pretty critical factor.

We and others in the industry were striving to get to free cash flow generation. We saw buoyancy in the price but it wasn't obvious that things were going to play out the way that they have. So we hedged strongly to protect against the downside. But mostly to ensure our ability to execute, get to free cash flow positive conditions in 2018. So that's how you think about the hedge book that we've got, that we're living with in 2018. In general, we've held back for several months and haven't added to 2019 position and we're wide open in 2020.

Obviously there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work that's relatively minor when you look at it across the issued. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is that kind of, so pretty modest.

Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period first 3 years or so in the play and we were talking about it, we held completion constant on reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we've pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development, with very low intensity parent. There was a period and there has been in any one of these plays because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well is bigger than yours. And we certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration in the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well-thought-out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear. That's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad [indiscernible]"

There's also exposure down there unfortunately, the acreage in the springers, some of which is being actively drilled by industry today. Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back around the place and time to inferred that original development which we look at and that would forward we look at it today is having under developed by the big production base. So he's an example of the things people will deal with. We've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that address, certified Mary drilling through these acreage positions and develop that's developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over damper so there's lots of things we go back to their. Ultimately we'll make the decision on investing on the basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP of North SCOOP as we speak. So the production is referenced on what we would call South SCOOP, it's a good there to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And presently on all sides, there is tons of private activities. So just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform. So right now, we're focused on pushing the development STACK and we're still drilling wells down there SCOOP, but given another phase, another phase, probably sometime actively towards the back end of the plan or after the 3-year plan, is my guess."

Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield a posted solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. This was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. We've also participated in some gassier, nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term.  
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. 
We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multiwell development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refiner bids for our oil strengthen in June, and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. 
This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. 
Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. We're continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infield pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we operated, participated in or traded for. We know have information on about 235 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole and every play, where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we're all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. 
Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the Number 2 well, or the well closest to the parent, and seen improved results. 
Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP approximately 24,000 net acres located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. 
Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turned to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million, and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate their efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. 
So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

We talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've got the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into '19, we dropped substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so, and we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year, and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan. As far as what we will do on the road ahead with regard to the free cash flow, obviously, we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest. But we're going to consider all the options as cash builds on the balance sheet, distribution, buybacks, as well as adding drilling activities in higher-return areas as warranted. The goal is to get to free cash, and we'll make the right decision as we see this sustainability in that area."

We've got to manage not just what we do, but we've got to manage in context with what our neighbors do to the left and right of us as we work through the developments. So there will be from time to time some impacts, mostly on timing, so there's timing uncertainty. But we're confident when we look at the mix of timing and outcome that we can deliver the volumes, so we're going to stay focused on delivering the 2018 volumes.

So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than that acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got, on an operated production, 7% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO. And these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and non-op. I told folks, in the first half of this year, it's never a bad thing when people want to drill wells on acreage that you own.

So we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color. But the early, early returns are positive. So we've been able to pressure up and/or refrac parent wells and bring those wells back online successfully. We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the Number 2 well, create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along these lines, and leaving large swats of acreage largely untouched. I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and, let's say, the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference.

As you referenced, our prior interactions, Doug, we're going to play this out just like we've played it before. We're drilling right now unbounded, HBP wells. That program will be completed in the first half of 2019, and then we'll make some decisions about how we progress in the infill development. I suspect we'll see that in 2019. And at that time, we will see some adjustments in that type curve as they will come down as we have seen in several of the other plays. I think we're going to play it right down in the middle of the fairway. I would hope to see a very similar type curve in the northwest area of North STACK to what we've seen. And at the end of the day, I mean, our goal is to create the best returns in the overall bounded cube development. This isn't a STACK issues, this is something that we see now playing out in all resource plays out there today."

Clearly, we talked about the gas and NGL component. I think that it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in the realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So that decision in it of itself drive some of those volumes, but it's also a good outcome in terms of when we think about the economics and cash flow kind of across the portfolio. I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated and went into the plan.

So we hedged strongly to protect our -- against the downside. But mostly to ensure our ability to execute and get to free cash flow positive conditions in 2018. So that's how you think about the hedge book that we've got, that we're living with in 2018.

The costs are relatively modest when you think about spreading them across the DSU, where you've got 6, 8, 10, 12 wells that you're talking about drilling.

Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across the DSU. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of cost, so pretty modest.

I think what's important to note, if you were -- knowing everything that you and we in the industry know today, if you had a development and you could fast-forward 6, 7 years into the future on some new development with all the learnings that you've got, you would go back to time 0 and say what I really want when I go through an HBP, the acreage are low-intensity completions because I don't want to create problems for myself in development. Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first 3 years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant. And I've made reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development with very low-intensity parent. There was a period, and there has been in any one of these plays, because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well is bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear, but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that [indiscernible]."

Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we look at.

You're not going to go back and put that at risk. So -- and in fact, by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things we go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there on the basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP of North SCOOP as we speak. That's the production I referenced down on what we would call South SCOOP. It's a good dirt to hold, so we've secured the option for the future.

The truth of the matter is there've been a couple of tax iterations in Oklahoma over the last couple of years. And the most recent adjustment, which was this year, is substantial.

Ultimately, I'm confident, we're confident, that Oklahoma officials understand the importance of our industry in the state and our company's investment in that state. So we are counting on the leadership there to get things right and maintain Oklahoma's position as a competitive place to do business. So at this stage we're monitoring the situation.

Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield posted a solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. [ BOEP ]was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of our overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. And we've also participated in some gassier, nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term. 
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. 
We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multi-well development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refinery bids for our oil strengthened in June, and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. 
Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. 
We're continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infill pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we have operated, participated in or traded for. We now have information on about 235 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole in every play, where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we're all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. 
Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the #2 well, or the well closest to the parent, and seen improved results. 
Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP, approximately 24,000 net acres, located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. 
Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turning to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million, and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate their efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. 
So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

I think we talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've got the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea of the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into '19, we drop substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so, and we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future, depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year, and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan. As far as what we will do on the road ahead with regard to the free cash flow, obviously, we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest.

That's what you're seeing in today's guidance. Nonop was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow it up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil, as compared to the numbers that we post. So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than the acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got, on an operated production, 70% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO. And these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and nonop.

The county commissioners have overstepped their jurisdiction. Regulatory oversight, those activities in Oklahoma rest with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. So as a result, we're optimistic the Oklahoma courts will strike down the ban that you're referencing. We believe the produced water recycling that we've invested in, the infrastructure to move water around, makes a lot of sense for the industry, for our company, for the state and local citizens. So I think we're in a good strong position there. I'm going to let Gary give you some idea of the extent of that infrastructure and kind of the potential impacts, which we see as minimal given the nature of our existing water infrastructure. Gary?"

We see this as a big issue for the local community and it's less of a big issue for Newfield because of the investments we've made. We've laid hard pipe up to very close to these wells and [ lay flat ] just bridges, that last portion, in order to get this recycled water and produced water back to these fracs. We think it's more of an issue of the need to continue to promote recycling, minimizing truck traffic. We think it's the right thing for the community, the right thing for the environment. And it's really going to have very little impact, if any at all, on our drilling programs."

So we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color. But the early, early returns are positive. So we've been able to pressure up and/or refrac parent wells and bring those wells back online successfully. We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the #2 well, create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along lease lines, and leaving large swaths of acreage largely untouched. So I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and, let's say, the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference. But ultimately, the results that get posted is a result of a lot of good work by the folks I referenced earlier, the men and women that are managing the asset for us and making these decisions. Not an accident."

I think that it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in the realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So that decision in and of itself drives some of those volumes, but it's also a good outcome in terms of when we think about the economics and cash flow kind of across the portfolio. I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated and went into the plan. I think most important, we referenced in the call, is we've got 5 or 6 multi-well DSUs that are inset into the central portion of our footprint, distributed along strike, that really -- those -- the results of those multi-well DSUs will underpin our 3-year plan.

Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across the DSU. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of cost, so pretty modest.

Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first 3 years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant. And I've made reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development with very low-intensity parent. There was a period, and there has been in any one of these plays, because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well's bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear, but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that..."

There's also exposure down there, a portion of the acreage in the Springer, some of which is being actively drilled by industry today. Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we looked at, in the Woodford, we look at today as having been underdeveloped but a big production base. So he's an example of the things people will deal with. You've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that at risk. So -- and in fact, by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things we can go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there on a basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP at North SCOOP as we speak. So most of the production I referenced is down in what we would call South SCOOP. It's good dirt to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And presently on all sides, there's tons of private activity. So just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform. So right now, we're focused on pushing the development STACK and we're still drilling wells down at SCOOP. But it'll have another phase --another phase of -- probably sometime actively towards the back end of the plan or after the 3-year plan, will be my guess."

Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield posted a solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. [ BOEP ]was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of our overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. And we've also participated in some gassier, nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term. 
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. 
We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multi-well development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refinery bids for our oil strengthened in June, and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. 
Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. 
We're continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infill pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we have operated, participated in or traded for. We now have information on about 235 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole in every play, where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we're all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. 
Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the #2 well, or the well closest to the parent, and seen improved results. 
Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP, approximately 24,000 net acres, located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. 
Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turning to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million, and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate their efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. 
So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

I think we talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've got the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea of the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into '19, we drop substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so, and we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future, depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year, and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan.

I think that the point of the slide is that the nonop production that we've had is, by definition, since it's west and down-dip of our acreage, is gassier in nature. That's what you're seeing in today's guidance. Nonop was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow it up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil, as compared to the numbers that we post. So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than the acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got, on an operated production, 70% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO. And these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and nonop. I told folks, in the first half of this year, it's never a bad thing when people want to drill wells on acreage that you own.

So we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color. But the early, early returns are positive. So we've been able to pressure up and/or refrac parent wells and bring those wells back online successfully. We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the #2 well, create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along lease lines, and leaving large swaths of acreage largely untouched. So I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and, let's say, the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference.

Coming out of the price collapse and coming out of it with cash on our balance sheet, kind of leads us to not having to hedge quite as much, and certainly kind of mimic the forward curve as you see that backwardation, as Lee points out. We've been taking advantage of going relatively short on our hedges. That's proved to be the right move for us. And you'll probably see that going forward as long as the curve stays backwardated and affords us the opportunity to wait and capture maybe another $5 or $6 per barrel."

Anytime we're experimenting, it's incremental cost. The costs are relatively modest when you think about spreading them across the DSU, where you've got 6, 8, 10, 12 wells that you're talking about drilling. The extra cost, when you see it, are probably going to be mostly in the areas of some incremental water handling and LOE-type expenses. Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across the DSU. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of cost, so pretty modest. And if you're able to mitigate depletion effects relative to the parent, it's well offset with the production performance of DSU. That's the way we think about it in terms of what we're trying to do.

I think what's important to note, if you were -- knowing everything that you and we in the industry know today, if you had a development and you could fast-forward 6, 7 years into the future on some new development with all the learnings that you've got, you would go back to time 0 and say what I really want when I go through an HBP, the acreage are low-intensity completions because I don't want to create problems for myself in development. Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first 3 years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant. And I've made reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development with very low-intensity parent. There was a period, and there has been in any one of these plays, because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well's bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear, but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that..."

Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we looked at, in the Woodford, we look at today as having been underdeveloped but a big production base. So he's an example of the things people will deal with. You've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that at risk. So -- and in fact, by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things we can go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there on a basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP at North SCOOP as we speak. So most of the production I referenced is down in what we would call South SCOOP. It's good dirt to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And presently on all sides, there's tons of private activity. So just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform. So right now, we're focused on pushing the development STACK and we're still drilling wells down at SCOOP. But it'll have another phase --another phase of -- probably sometime actively towards the back end of the plan or after the 3-year plan, will be my guess."

I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield posted a solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. [ BOEP ]was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of our overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. And we've also participated in some gassier, nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term. 
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. 
We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multi-well development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refinery bids for our oil strengthened in June, and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. 
Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. 
We're continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infill pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we have operated, participated in or traded for. We now have information on about 235 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole in every play, where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we're all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. 
Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the #2 well, or the well closest to the parent, and seen improved results. 
Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP, approximately 24,000 net acres, located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. 
Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turning to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million, and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate their efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. 
So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

I think we talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've got the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea of the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into '19, we drop substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so, and we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future, depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year, and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan. As far as what we will do on the road ahead with regard to the free cash flow, obviously, we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest. But we're going to consider all the options as cash builds on the balance sheet, distribution, buybacks, as well as adding drilling activities in higher-return areas as [ warranted ]. The goal is to get to free cash, and we'll make the right decision as we see this sustainability in that area."

That's what you're seeing in today's guidance. Nonop was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow it up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil, as compared to the numbers that we post. So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than the acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got, on an operated production, 70% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO. And these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and nonop. I told folks, in the first half of this year, it's never a bad thing when people want to drill wells on acreage that you own.

So we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color. But the early, early returns are positive. So we've been able to pressure up and/or refrac parent wells and bring those wells back online successfully. We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the #2 well, create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along lease lines, and leaving large swaths of acreage largely untouched. So I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and, let's say, the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference.

Obviously, if we weren't delivering results, strong results consistent with the plan, then we wouldn't have posted the strong first half. So I think the first thing is that all of the assumptions that our team built in are intact with regard to performance through the first half of the year. Clearly, we talked about the gas and NGL component. I think that it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in the realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So that decision in and of itself drives some of those volumes, but it's also a good outcome in terms of when we think about the economics and cash flow kind of across the portfolio. I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated and went into the plan. I think most important, we referenced in the call, is we've got 5 or 6 multi-well DSUs that are inset into the central portion of our footprint, distributed along strike, that really -- those -- the results of those multi-well DSUs will underpin our 3-year plan.

The extra cost, when you see it, are probably going to be mostly in the areas of some incremental water handling and LOE-type expenses. Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across the DSU. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of cost, so pretty modest.

I think what's important to note, if you were -- knowing everything that you and we in the industry know today, if you had a development and you could fast-forward 6, 7 years into the future on some new development with all the learnings that you've got, you would go back to time 0 and say what I really want when I go through an HBP, the acreage are low-intensity completions because I don't want to create problems for myself in development. Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first 3 years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant. And I've made reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development with very low-intensity parent. There was a period, and there has been in any one of these plays, because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well's bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear, but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that..."

Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we looked at, in the Woodford, we look at today as having been underdeveloped but a big production base. So he's an example of the things people will deal with. You've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that at risk. So -- and in fact, by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things we can go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there on a basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP at North SCOOP as we speak. So most of the production I referenced is down in what we would call South SCOOP. It's good dirt to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And presently on all sides, there's tons of private activity. So just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform.

Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release, @NFX and 10-Q. 
Newfield posted a solid second quarter, our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. [ BOEP ]was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day, and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in line with guidance. 
Oil as a percentage of our overall production in Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream, in line with guidance. We drilled some very productive operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. We've also participated in some gassier, nonoperated developments in both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near term. 
Our year-over-year growth in the Anadarko Basin was exceptional. We grew barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. 
We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large multi-well development pads. 
Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refiner bids for our oil strengthened in June, and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today. 
In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect 1 to 2 liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production. 
Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date has run about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plans. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs. As a result, we are today increasing our full year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. 
Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead. 
Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our second quarter release. 
Second quarter revenues were $679 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. 
Consistent positive operating results, combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion. 
From an operating perspective, we are performing well, year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. 
We're continuing to see consistent solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infill pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK including the wells we have operated, participated in or traded for. We now have information on about 235 infill wells. 
Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and examples of how we're applying them to create value. Industry as a whole in every play, where active development is underway, is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full-field development, we're all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return. 
Although we don't have all the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU. On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the #2 well, or the well closest to the parent, and seen improved results. 
Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return. Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a 1-rig program to HBP, approximately 24,000 net acres, located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. We can find more -- you can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication. 
Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018. 
Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin. 
We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year, with 10 wells turned to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million, and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year. 
That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong debt-adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction. 
Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of Team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy, and we appreciate their efforts. And without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter we have. 
So thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments on our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions."

I think we talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've got the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind with respect to the first half of this year. But we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So I think when you look at the combined effects of that $11 million to the positive in the second quarter, with a $67 million hedge book adjustment against that, gives you some idea of the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018, second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into '19, we dropped substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so, and we're unhedged in 2020. So a lot of what happens on the road to the future, depends obviously on the price path. But we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year, and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan. As far as what we will do on the road ahead with regard to the free cash flow, obviously, we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest. But we're going to consider all the options as cash builds on the balance sheet, distribution, buybacks, as well as adding drilling activities in higher-return areas as warranted. The goal is to get to free cash, and we'll make the right decision as we see this sustainability in that area."

That's what you're seeing in today's guidance. Nonop was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow it up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil, as compared to the numbers that we post. So the point of that slide there, when you look at the 3 phase, which we present our numbers with 3 phase, you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than the acreage to the west of us. And the NGL yields, as a consequence, because it's a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So we've got, on an operated production, 70% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO. And these are strong economics. So we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period to period. And I think we've been consistent on pointing that out. So that's what you're seeing. Good investments, good investments OBO and nonop.

We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the #2 well, create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage, our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along lease lines, and leaving large swaths of acreage largely untouched. But I think that's a positive as well. And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days and, let's say, the first 2.5, 3 years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot, 950 gallons. So when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference. But ultimately, the results that get posted is a result of a lot of good work by the folks I referenced earlier, the men and women that are managing the asset for us and making these decisions. Not an accident."

And at that time, we will see some adjustments in that type curve as they will come down as we have seen in several of the other plays. I think we're going to play it right down in the middle of the fairway. I would hope to see a very similar type curve in the northwest area of North STACK to what we've seen.

So I think the first thing is that all of the assumptions that our team built in are intact with regard to performance through the first half of the year. Clearly, we talked about the gas and NGL component. I think that it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in the realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So that decision in and of itself drives some of those volumes, but it's also a good outcome in terms of when we think about the economics and cash flow kind of across the portfolio. I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated and went into the plan. I think most important, we referenced in the call, is we've got 5 or 6 multi-well DSUs that are inset into the central portion of our footprint, distributed along strike, that really -- those -- the results of those multi-well DSUs will underpin our 3-year plan.

So we hedged strongly to protect our -- against the downside but mostly to ensure our ability to execute and get to free cash flow positive conditions in 2018.

The extra cost, when you see it, are probably going to be mostly in the areas of some incremental water handling and LOE-type expenses. Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across the DSU. I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of cost, so pretty modest. And if you're able to mitigate depletion effects relative to the parent, it's well offset with the production performance of DSU. That's the way we think about it in terms of what we're trying to do.

I think what's important to note, if you were -- knowing everything that you and we in the industry know today, if you had a development and you could fast-forward 6, 7 years into the future on some new development with all the learnings that you've got, you would go back to time 0 and say what I really want when I go through an HBP, the acreage are low-intensity completions because I don't want to create problems for myself in development. Well, what you have today is we stayed for 3 years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first 3 years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant. And I've made reference, 950 by 950, so 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example. So our team already took the step on the front end of planning for development with very low-intensity parent. There was a period, and there has been in any one of these plays, because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race, my well's bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells. The truth is, we kept that to a minimum. We kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play. But as far as where we sit, I like how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical, it's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And today, we're mitigating those effects and having success. But I think it's all tied together with 6 or 7 years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear, but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that [indiscernible]..."

Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we look at. And the Woodford, we look at today as having been underdeveloped but a big production base. So he's an example of the things people will deal with. You've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that at risk. So -- and in fact, by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things we can go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there on the basis of how it competes within the portfolio. There's a -- it's all HBP, so I've already talked about multiple layers. We're actively finishing up the HBP at North SCOOP as we speak. So most of the production I referenced is down in what we would call South SCOOP. It's good dirt to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And presently on all sides, there's tons of private activity. So just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform.

In general, we'll attack that moving from west to east. I referenced the multi-well -- the 5 multi-well DSUs that we've drilled up on the leading edge of our development footprint in the 3-year plan. We'll have that production information starting to come back to us in the back half of this year. All of that will be incorporated to further refine our forecast '19 forward. Fourth quarter is probably when you'll really see, if you look closely at the CapEx in the fourth quarter, part of the reason it's down is that we're going -- we're shifting into drilling the first road drilling. So those completions actually hit early in 2019. We also -- because you're going across the acreage in an orderly fashion, we're going to drill through areas that have different working interests. So it just so happens where we're starting, the working interest on average is down some 20 points over what we've done year-to-date. But it's the right thing to do. It's the right way to think about development and we're going to transition there starting late this year."

So I'd be remiss not to point that out. But clearly, the GPT is the most significant headwind that we've been handed. The truth of the matter is there've been a couple of tax iterations in Oklahoma over the last couple of years. And the most recent adjustment, which was this year, is substantial. And I think that the focus from our standpoint as a team -- management team and board, is we're going to work every day to claw back what that GPT increase takes away, and we'll keep all options on the table in terms of attacking that issue. Ultimately, I'm confident, we're confident, that Oklahoma officials understand the importance of our industry in the state and our company's investment in that state. So we're counting on the leadership there to get things right and maintain Oklahoma's position as a competitive place to do business. So at this stage, we're monitoring the situation.

This is a big day for our company and our shareholders. Earlier this morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive merger agreement with Encana Corporation in an all stock transaction. We're looking forward to providing you with highlights from this quarter as well as key highlights from this transaction. We're planning to keep this call very brief as our employees will be gathering down the street to hear from Doug Suttles and myself immediately after today's call. 
This transaction will create a leading North American multi-basin company and we're confident that it's in the best interest of our owners. When combined, our companies will have the key attributes that should be differentiated in today's energy sector. 
In short, we're taking 2 great companies and creating an even better one. We will have scale. Combined, we will have core of the core acreage and some of the best liquids rich basins across North America and our net daily production will exceed 575,000 BOE per day, of which more than half will be liquids. 
The union will create one of the largest onshore liquids companies in North America. 
Importantly, the combination of the 2 companies and the quality of the assets will generate long term growth while generating excess cash that can be returned to shareholders through dividends and buybacks as you may have seen with Encana's announcement today on their additional shareholder-friendly initiatives. 
Over the last few months, we've clearly heard from our largest investors and we know that the return of cash to owners is a mandate on the road ahead. This unique combination will offer the ongoing development of our assets to create the most value for shareholders. 
Let's move on to the third quarter financial results. Newfield posted a very solid third quarter. Our consolidated net production in the third quarter was more than 202,000 BOE per day. Our domestic production in the quarter came in about 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 5% above the midpoint of our guidance, up more than 25% year-over-year. 
Our third quarter net production in the SCOOP and the STACK was nearly 144,000 BOE per day, up more than 35% year-over-year. 
Third quarter net liquids in the basin was in line with guidance, averaging approximately 87,000 barrels per day. Oil production from Anadarko Basin grew 17% year-over-year to 43,200 barrels of oil per day, in line with guidance. 
Our consolidated third quarter revenues were $711 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $349 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $373 million. 
With near line and our capital investments and cash flows, we have maintained a strong cash balance and ended the quarter with $264 million of cash on hand.  Our third quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street's estimates. 
Adjusting for the items noted in our news release, our net income for the quarter would have been $204 million or $1.01 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our third quarter release. 
We continue to see great results in the SCOOP and the STACK and we are, today, increasing our full year Anadarko Basin net production guidance to 130,000 to 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year total domestic net production guidance is being raised to 185,000 to 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Full year capital investments are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion ex-capitalized internal cost. This compares to prior guidance of $1.35 billion. The additional investment in the fourth quarter are primarily related to accelerated completions in the Anadarko Basin and the continuation of our operated rig in Uinta Basin through the end of the year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to share some brief highlights from each of our active growing programs. We continue to see solid well results in STACK and we have rapidly migrated to cube development, commencing road drilling operations across multiple drilling units. This effort will allow the team to optimize completions, test simultaneous cube development at the Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations and reduce downtime associated with the outside operating activities. 
Our Williston team has continued to be a premier operator in the basin and we expect to generate more than $140 million of excess cash in the Williston in 2018. 
In the Uinta, the company has grown production 16% year-over-year with a single rig program and is now producing approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to the company. 
Before closing out today's call, let me, again, reiterate our enthusiasm for today's announced transaction. Upon closing, this unique combination creates a dominant, multi-basin company with core of the core positions in 3 of the top North American liquids plays. This union will come with nearly 600,000 barrels of equivalent net daily production and a deep inventory of projects for future development. 
Perhaps most importantly, it provides what we think investors are demanding today, a unique balance of profitable growth and a return of cash to the shareholder. 
Thanks for your time this morning. We look forward to seeing you on the road ahead. Good day."

Before closing out today's call, let me, again, reiterate our enthusiasm for today's announced transaction. Upon closing, this unique combination creates a dominant, multi-basin company with core-of-the-core positions in 3 of the top North American liquids plays. This union will come with nearly 600,000 barrels of equivalent net daily production and a deep inventory of projects for future development. Perhaps, most importantly, it provides what we think investors are demanding today, a unique balance of profitable growth and a return of cash to the shareholder. 
Thanks for your time this morning. We look forward to seeing you on the road ahead. Good day."

This is a big day for our company and our shareholders. Early this morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive merger agreement with Encana Corporation in an all-stock transaction. We're looking forward to providing you with highlights from this quarter as well as key highlights from this transaction. We're planning to keep this call very brief as our employees will be gathering down the street to hear from Doug Suttles and myself immediately after today's call. 
This transaction will create a leading North American multi-basin company, and we are confident that it's in the best interest of our owners. When combined, our companies will have the key attributes that should be differentiated in today's energy sector. In short, we're taking 2 great companies and creating an even better one. We will have scale, combined. We will have core-of-the-core acreage and some of the best liquids-rich basins across North America, and our net daily production will exceed 575,000 BOE per day, of which more than half will be liquids. The union will create one of the largest onshore liquids companies in North America. 
Importantly, the combination of the 2 companies and the quality of the assets will generate long-term growth while generating excess cash that can be returned to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, as you may have seen with Encana's announcement today on their additional shareholder-friendly initiatives. 
Over the last few months, we have clearly heard from our largest investors and we know that a return of cash to owners is a mandate on the road ahead. This unique combination will allow for the ongoing development of our assets to create the most value for shareholders. 
Let's move on to the third quarter financial results. Newfield posted a very solid third quarter. Our consolidated net production in the third quarter was more than 202,000 BOE per day. Our domestic production in the quarter came in about 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 5% above the midpoint of our guidance, up more than 25% year-over-year. 
Our third quarter net production in the SCOOP and the STACK was nearly 144,000 BOE per day, up more than 35% year-over-year. 
Third quarter net liquids in the basin was in line with guidance, averaging approximately 87,000 barrels per day. Oil production from the Anadarko Basin grew 17% year-over-year to 43,200 barrels of oil per day, in line with guidance. Our consolidated third quarter revenues were $711 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $349 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $373 million. 
With near alignment in our capital investments and cash flows, we have maintained a strong cash balance and ended the quarter with $264 million of cash on hand.  Our third quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. 
Adjusting for the items noted in our news release, our net income for the quarter would have been $204 million or $1.01 per share. Please see the explanation and reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our third quarter release. 
We continue to see great results in the SCOOP and the STACK, and we are, today, increasing our full year Anadarko Basin net production guidance to 130,000 to 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our full year total domestic net production guidance is being raised to 185,000 to 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Full year capital investments are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion ex-capitalized internal cost. This compares to prior guidance of $1.35 billion. The additional investments in the fourth quarter are primarily related to accelerated completions in the Anadarko Basin and the continuation of our operated rig in Uinta Basin through the end of the year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to share some brief highlights from each of our active growing programs. We continue to see solid well results in STACK, and we have rapidly migrated to cube development, commencing road-drilling operations across multiple drilling units. This effort will allow the team to optimize completions, test simultaneous cube development at the Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations and reduce downtime associated with the outside-operated activities.
