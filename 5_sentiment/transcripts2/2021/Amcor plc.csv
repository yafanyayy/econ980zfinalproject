I appreciate you taking the time and making the effort to join the call. As Tracey mentioned, joining me on the line today is Mic",1919,"Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for being with us today to discuss Amcor's first half results for the 2021 fiscal year. I appreciate you taking the time and making the effort to join the call. As Tracey mentioned, joining me on the line today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's CFO. And we'll start with some brief prepared comments before we take your questions. 
But the first place we'll start on Slide 3 is with safety, and everything we do at Amcor starts with safety. And this year, of course, we're also focused on keeping all of our coworkers healthy as well. And over the last 12 months, our COVID protocols have enabled us to do just that while also keeping our plants running to supply our food and health care customers around the world. 
And despite the added challenges of operating during the pandemic, our safety performance has continued to be a real highlight. Across the company, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% during the first half. And all of our business groups had fewer injuries compared to the first half last year. And we're also pleased to report that over half of our sites around the world were injury-free for at least 12 months. So we still have not reached our goal of no injuries, but we need to acknowledge the commitment and focus of all of our coworkers to keeping each other healthy and also safe, especially in the current environment. 
Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, Amcor had a strong first half of fiscal '21, ahead of our expectations, balanced across all businesses and regions. And that strong first half translates into higher expectations for the full year on the back of strong momentum in the base business. And so the second key message today is that we've raised our outlook for EPS growth, full year fiscal '21, to 10% to 14% on a constant currency basis. 
Third, we're also increasing cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and $200 million of additional share repurchases. And the fourth point is that we continue to believe Amcor has never been better positioned from an investment case perspective. And I'll spend a few minutes explaining why we believe that before I turn it over to Michael, who will describe the recent results in more detail. 
Slide 5 is a simple snapshot of Amcor today and understanding who we are and what we do has to be the basis for understanding that investment case. The company has been around a long time, over 160 years and is now the global leader in consumer packaging. And Amcor is a truly global company with scale positions in every major region, including over $3 billion of annual sales in faster-growing emerging markets, where we also have leadership in scale positions. 
Essentially, all of our sales are to fast-moving consumer or health care segments. And the health care business now generates around $2 billion of sales each year to the medical device and pharmaceutical markets, which are among the most attractive places to play in the packaging industry. And finally, regardless of whether they're operating in developed or emerging markets or in consumer or health care segments, all of our businesses go to market with differentiated innovation capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world. 
Slide 6 is another quick snapshot, this one to highlight Amcor's performance and track record over the last 10 years. And we've maintained, as a starting point, a consistent investment-grade capital structure despite several transformational transactions. And we've driven consistent sales and earnings growth and always had high cash conversion. And that cash flow has funded capital investment in the business and close to 30 acquisitions over this time period, along with share repurchases and a growing dividend with an attractive yield. And added together and shareholders have been rewarded as well as the company has delivered consistent operating performance. 
Now going forward, we expect our operating performance and cash flow to remain at least this strong and our approach to allocating that cash is set out on Slide 7. This is not new. There's no changes here to this framework but it's worth just reviewing. We consistently generate significant free cash flow every year. And this year, our free cash flow will be nearly $1.1 billion and that number will grow over time. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A or share repurchases. 
And in addition, we'll continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend, which has historically yielded between 4% and 5%. Taken together, the EPS growth and dividend yield should result in 10% to 15% of shareholder value each year. And so while we've been delivering returns to shareholders at this level for a long time now, momentum is building in the business and we believe this is a special time for the company and our investors. 
Slide 8 is the slide we shared last year at our investor briefing and it remains relevant today. And we believe that the Amcor investment case is as strong now as it's ever been and we set out the reasons why in this slide. And several of the points I've made already, global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive markets, strong balance sheet and cash flow to fund growth and dividends and a consistent track record, and they're all important features of our investment case, but we also believe that momentum matters in business. 
And in that last respect -- in that respect, the last point on the slide might just be the most important. Momentum has been building across Amcor over the last couple of years, and we expect it to continue. And that should be clear from our recent performance, including the first half result and the increased full year guidance that we're announcing today. 
At the core of our investment case is the consistent organic growth Amcor generates in several ways, as set out on Slide 9. The starting point for the organic growth is the mix of growing end markets we play in, and that's especially true in emerging markets. We've had a long history of profitable participation and profitable growth in emerging markets, and high-impact locations like China and India continue to grow sales and profit at impressive rates, including in the most recent half. 
Managing our sales mix across higher-value, more packaging-intensive consumer end markets like protein and premium coffee and more differentiated product types like hot-fill containers or barrier films drives consistent margin expansion and volume growth over time. And we have a global health care business approaching $2 billion in sales from every region of the world and across the pharmaceutical and medical device segments. 
Innovation is also an important growth driver for Amcor and probably the area where we are the most differentiated from our competition. Our customers are launching new products in Amcor packaging regularly. We've highlighted a few examples here of new and actually, more sustainable products commercialized in recent months, including an extension of our HeatFlex family of products with the world's first microwavable recycle-ready pouch for food and some premium coffee packaging using a bio-based polymer. 
And finally, a common thread that cuts across all of what we do is sustainability, which we believe is Amcor's greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation. A few more comments on Slide 10 to describe our comprehensive sustainability agenda, which includes our products but also our factories. Of course, we're deeply committed to the idea of responsible packaging, and we're working with our partners upstream and downstream to address concerns about packaging waste in the environment. We've stepped up to take a leadership role in the development of responsible packaging, which we believe requires 3 things: the first is package design, which accounts for the full product life cycle, in addition to the end-of-life or waste profile. And Amcor is uniquely positioned here with leading R&D and innovation capabilities to handle the package design requirements, and we pointed out some examples already in this presentation. 
The other 2 requirements for responsible packaging require collaboration with others across our value chain, and Amcor has been active in that way as well to help drive improvements in waste management and consumer participation. A couple of examples over the last 6 months help highlight that work. In 1 case, Amcor has joined with 35 leading brands and retailers in the Consumer Goods Forum and a CEO-led initiative to develop package design rules to deliver packaging that's easier and more cost effective to recycle. 
In another example, we've extended our work with the Carbon Trust to launch a label that can be printed on pack to indicate reduced CO2 intensity and provide greater transparency to the carbon footprint reductions enabled by our packaging. And the value created through our work in these initiatives and the progress we've made across a range of other ESG areas, including our EnviroAction program in all of our plants to drive greenhouse gas reduction, waste and water reduction, continues to be recognized by leading independent organizations, most recently MSCI and Dow Jones. 
Turning now to a summary of our first half results on Slide 11. We had strong earnings growth with EPS up 16% in constant currency terms, including 7% organic growth and strength in both the Rigid Packaging and Flexibles segments. Demand for our products remain balanced across regions and businesses, resulting in volume and sales growth in every region and 3% for Amcor overall. The execution discipline and operating performance of the businesses drove cost performance, which also contributed to the organic profit growth. 
Roughly 6% of the EPS growth came from synergies from the Bemis acquisition, which was ahead of expectations, and cost synergies totaled an incremental $35 million pretax during the half. And lastly, benefits from share repurchases accounted for the remaining EPS growth. 
Free cash flow was in line with expectations and our balance sheet remains strong, and the company returned $450 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first 6 months. Strength in the underlying business also enables us to increase cash returns to shareholders for the balance of the year. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.1175 per share, which is higher than the prior year. And we announced today an additional $200 million of share repurchases, bringing the total announced this year to $350 million, which we expect to complete during the remainder of FY '21. 
The key theme enabling the strong performance in the half across the company has been the ability of every one of our businesses to execute and outperform against the things that are within our control despite an incredibly challenging and volatile external environment. Safety, working capital, cost synergies, cost performance, innovation, in all of those areas, the execution has been outstanding, and we could not be more pleased with the performance of our teams through the first 6 months of the year. The key message here is that Amcor had a strong first half with results ahead of expectations, and we have an improved outlook for the full year and increased dividends and share repurchases to go along with it. With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some additional color on the financial performance for the half year and the outlook for the rest of 2021."

I'll start with some comments on the Flexibles segment on Slide 12. Overall segment volumes were 2% higher than the prior year.

I'll start with some comments on the Flexibles segment on Slide 12. Overall segment volumes were 2% higher than the prior year. As Ron mentioned, demand has been broad-based, with growth across all regions in the low to mid single-digit range. From an end market perspective, we've seen solid growth in food, pet food and beverage categories. And this was partly offset by lower volumes in certain health care end markets, driven by reduced elective surgery rates and lower prescription trends. 
Higher volumes were partially offset by unfavorable price/mix, resulting in net sales being 1% higher than the first half of last year, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency and the pass-through of lower raw material costs. Adjusted EBIT for the period grew 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, driven by the higher volumes, strong operating cost performance and $30 million of cost synergy benefits, which I'll come back to in a moment. Particularly pleasing to see the performance of the Flexibles business continue to improve as we extract benefits from the Bemis acquisition, deliver innovative new products to support customer growth and operate our plants efficiently. 
Now turning to Slide 13 and synergies. So in terms of cost synergies related to the Bemis acquisition, the ability to continue delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and adjustments to our operating footprint has been exceptional despite the need to address some additional challenges prevented in a COVID environment. As Ron mentioned, we are tracking ahead of expectations with $35 million of benefits included in our first half results. And given the strong progress we have made across a range of synergy projects in the last 6 months, we now expect to deliver approximately $70 million in fiscal '21, which is at the top end of our previous guidance range. 
This means at the end of this fiscal year, we'll have reached $150 million of cumulative benefits. We also have good visibility to remaining initiatives, which leaves us very confident with regards to our original expectation of $180 million in cumulative benefits by the end of fiscal '22. 
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 14. In summary, the business delivered another outstanding result, with organic growth driving year-to-date earnings 10% higher than the same period last year. Sales growth included a 6% increase in volume as well as a 4% price/mix benefit, including higher price to recover cost inflation in Latin America. Volume performance continues to be strong in North America and mix was positive. Beverage volumes were up 9% compared with last year and hot-fill container volumes were up 19%. There has been strong consumer demand across all beverage segments, particularly in hot-fill categories, including juice and sports drinks, where Amcor also benefited from favorable customer mix. 
This strong demand reflects higher at-home consumption of packaged products, and this has been supported by the work brand owners have done to increase the availability of multipacks across a wider range of product categories and through the launch of innovative brand extension and new health and wellness-orientated products and PET containers. Specialty container volumes are also higher as a result of continued growth in spirits, personal care and home cleaning categories. 
As a partial offset, volumes were marginally lower in Latin America. This represents a sequential improvement and trends generally improved through the current half. While we saw higher volumes in Brazil, Central America and Argentina, month-to-month variability continues and performance remains mixed by country in the region. Strong overall EBIT growth of 10% reflects good leverage from the 6% volume growth and favorable mix across the business, partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America, which were incurred in order to service the higher demand. So overall, we're happy with the performance of this business during the half year and believe we are well positioned to support customer needs and deliver continued growth. 
Moving to cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 15. Adjusted free cash flow of $276 million was higher than the prior year, excluding approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments that were deferred under the CARES Act from Q4 2020. And as a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year, and this outcome was in line with our expectations, which leaves us on track to deliver more than $1 billion in this financial year. 
We remain focused on improved working capital management, and execution has been strong across all businesses, with our rolling 12-month average working capital sales ratio continuing to improve, closing at 8.2% for sales at the end of December. This represents more than a $300 million reduction in average working capital over the last 18 months since the Bemis acquisition. 
Our financial profile remains strong and leverage is 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is in line with where we would expect to be at this time of the fiscal year. As Ron mentioned, with strong annual cash flow and an investment-grade credit rating, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in the many growth opportunities available to us, as well as increased returns to through a growing dividend and further share repurchases. 
In terms of the outlook for fiscal 2021 full year on Slide 16, the strong start to the year through solid volume-driven organic growth and synergy outperformance as well as the momentum we see in the business are the 2 factors which have given us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance for the second consecutive quarter. We expect the business will continue to execute, deliver further synergy benefits and grow organically as a global supplier for essential consumer and health care products. However, we are also maintaining a reasonably wide range of outcomes for the remaining 6 months of our fiscal year, which is appropriate, given the ongoing uncertainty and complexity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We now expect constant currency EPS growth range of 10% to 14%. And while we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between $1 billion to $1.1 billion, we see more opportunities to deliver cash flow towards the top half of that range. 
To recap, the business is performing very well. Growth from organic sources and synergies is strong, our financial profile remains solid and we are positioned to deliver another year of EPS growth in 2021, which will be ahead of our original expectations. So with that, I'll hand it back to Ron."

So hot-fill juices, iced teas, isotonics, those categories have been very strong throughout the whole first half and especially in the second quarter. 
I think it's a combination of things, Keith. There's some additional sales going through multipacks and big-box retailers, which are certainly helping. There's an introduction of some new products.

So it's very difficult to predict that aspect of it. 
But I think some of the underlying trends around new product launches, multipack sales, some of our particular customers gaining share, those things we would expect to continue. But all of that is incorporated into our overall guidance for the full fiscal year."

Now it's also getting increasingly difficult to pull apart what's a synergy versus what's a base business driver. I mean, as you can imagine, the businesses are completely integrated now. 
As far as what's driving the performance, generally speaking, I think we've probably exceeded our expectations across the 3 big cost synergy buckets: so overheads which came out faster and probably yielded a bit more benefit than we would have thought; the procurement savings have been higher than we would have expected; and footprint, which is building momentum is also positively contributing. And I guess, if we're thinking about this year in particular, we've gotten some more footprint benefits than we thought we might be able to, given the COVID backdrop, which makes those projects difficult to execute."

And the conclusion we've come to is that we really had no net impact, one way or the other. And the way we get there, if you just take the big chunks of drivers, we've had a lot of extra costs in the business and increasingly so as we've continued to operate. 
We've had lots of folks out on quarantine. We've had lots of overtime to backfill those people. We have lots of extra shipping going around in the Rigids business. So there's a lot of costs to be borne in this environment, first of all. And then the offset to that is obviously some stronger volumes in certain segments, like the beverage segment that we talked about a minute or 2 ago. 
The offset is commercially is health care, which is a really high-margin, attractive, profitable segment for us has been really soft. Medical device consumption generally has been very low with less elective procedures, surgeries and otherwise. Prescriptions have been way down. And so the sales in that health care business have been way off. So higher costs in many parts of the business, some strong sales in some segments like beverage offsetting some weak sales in medical and pharmaceutical. 
The net-net of all those puts and takes as we look at the business is really not much. And 3% sales growth is not too far off where we've been historically. We've been at about 2% over the last 5 or 6 years. And the profit growth is flowing from that plus the cost performance and synergies in the business. So I mean, we do a lot of work on this and there's a lot of interest in it, but our conclusion is there's really no net impact."

And then for my follow-up, I wondered, Ron, if you could just give us a kind of a quick lay of the land for plastic packaging in your key markets from a political and regulatory environment. It seems like in the short term, you've benefited because people have kind of moved to kind of more single-use products. I mean, we aren't seeing people here in the States go to the grocery store with kind of returnable bags anymore. 
But at the same time, it seems like from a medium-term perspective, we are seeing kind of more discussion in Europe and even here in the U.S., to some degree, of producers having to fund sort of end-of-life solutions to packaging, and that winds up getting embedded in the cost. So maybe if you could just give us a sense of kind of what you're seeing from a political and regulatory standpoint in just your main markets."

You asked about the political environment. I would maybe broaden that to just say the general environment, political, consumer, customer and otherwise. I mean, the short answer I would give y",379,"Well, yes, I mean, let's start with that part of your question. You asked about the political environment. I would maybe broaden that to just say the general environment, political, consumer, customer and otherwise. I mean, the short answer I would give you is, you asked how we see that environment evolving. And the short answer, I would say, is it's improving. 
And it's improving for a couple of reasons. One that you highlighted already, which is that I think the value of packaging and the role it plays in food and health care has become even more evident over the last 12 months. I don't know that we need to spend a lot of time explaining that. But I think the idea of packaged food is clear. I think the distribution of medicines and now we see vaccines and how important packaging is and the delivery devices are in that process. So I think the value of packaging has increased in the eyes of pretty much any observer full stop. 
As it relates to plastic, I think the other thing that's happening which is quite helpful is an increasing focus on greenhouse gases and climate. And I think as people and stakeholders get more and more educated holistically on the environmental impacts of different types of packaging, I think increasingly, plastic scores pretty well. And that's why we continue to see our customers very focused on finding better alternatives for the end-of-life of their packaging but increasingly focused on doing what they're doing today with lighter weight and better functionality. 
I think the point you made about funding waste collection, extended producer responsibility, things like that, that has a role because clearly, we need the waste management infrastructure in place around the world to address the waste problem that we have and that needs to be funded. And there are good successful models where funding that's generated through EPRs goes directly to waste infrastructure and can certainly help alleviate the problem. There's nothing wrong with that. We're in favor of well-designed EPRs as long as they're focused and targeted at the right level of infrastructure. So generally speaking, the environment has improved. We expect it to continue to improve as people get more educated on the total topic."

Some of the -- we had positive mix as well in the hot-fill container business.

So we've gone from about 4% or 5% of the resin that we processed to exiting December at about 10% of the total resin that we process in that business, and that number will go up again by June. 
So there really is no limit. There's no technical limit to the amount of recycled content we can use in the container. We're making plenty with all PCR.

Those are really good examples of having a differentiated product and a differentiated offering that even the customers now are trying to reconcile and get their heads around in terms of what they can and can't do. The AmLite structure, the basic chemistry behind it has got wide applications. So we've launched the product for pet food first. And then we've also more recently announced a rice package that essentially uses similar technology. 
The demand has been really far exceeded our expectations. And now we're going to have to scale up the capacity, which is a good thing to deliver against that demand. But it's a good example of solving a problem that didn't seem to have a really easy answer maybe 12 months ago for these big brand owners and also their smaller competitors. So I'd say, watch this space. 
On AmLite, there's incredible appetite, not only from the European customer base where the product was first launched but also around the world. India, Brazil, obviously, North America, China, there are kind of advanced orders or a book build, if you will, taking place globally for that structure. 
On Eco-Tite, this is a recycle-ready structure, but maybe even more importantly, right now, it's a PVDC structure or PVDC-free structure, sorry, for protein, which is also a major concern for many brand owners to get PVDC and chlorides out of their packaging. And so this 1 has been targeted at the European protein market in the first instance. There's a lot of take-up there where that material is of particularly high concern. It's pretty early days but I would expect that demand to start to also come from the other regions of the world as well.  
So I mean, you alluded to it, neither of these products are going to change the overall revenue profile of the company in a given quarter. But over time, the cumulative momentum of products like these is going to help generate good top line growth and good margin."

But the organic performance of the business has actually picked up a bit, and we expect it to sort of stay at that level and build momentum through the second half as well."

We're active acquirers and we would expect to continue to acquire. So that's the first priority is to reinvest in the business, grow the business, continue to consolidate and acquire. And we're certainly going to get increasingly active as the Bemis integration and synergy capture comes to a close. And we'll be actively looking at now, as you'd imagine. 
And the benefit of doing an on-market buyback is flexibility. So if we were to come across an opportunity that required more capital, we could always suspend the share repurchases. Although as you also know, most of the deals in our space are pretty small, so in all likelihood, we could fund acquisitions and continue the share repurchases. 
I think the last point I would make comes to the way you asked the question, which is around value. And I think we would say, as we look across the industry, yes, asset values are relatively high but the best value in the industry right now is Amcor. And so what better time to buying shares in the company than right now, where we have clear line of sight into where the business is traveling and the momentum that the business has? So we would never try to be stock-pickers here. But from a value perspective, we think Amcor is probably the best value in the sector at the moment."

I mean, look, at the moment, we're at a comfortable utilization level and an efficient utilization level, probably with the exception of Rigids, more recently, as Mike alluded to. So when we talk about extraordinary cost to service extraordinary demand, that is one of the outcomes of running at very, very high capacity utilization, probably too high over time. Now we don't expect that to continue as we've talked about. But other than that segment, and then the inverse would be true in health care, where the demand has been soft, generally speaking, we're running at a more normal level of utilization.

We appreciate you taking the time and making the effort to join the call. As Tracey mentioned, joining me on the line today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's CFO. And we'll start with some brief prepared comments before we take your questions.  
But the first place we'll start on Slide 3 is with safety, and everything we do at Amcor starts with safety. And this year, of course, we're also focused on keeping all of our co-workers healthy as well. And over the last 12 months, our COVID protocols have enabled us to do just that while also keeping our plants running to supply our food and health care customers around the world. And despite the added challenges of operating during the pandemic, our safety performance has continued to be a real highlight. Across the company, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% during the first half, and all of our business groups had fewer injuries compared to the first half last year. And we're also pleased to report that over half of our sites around the world were injury-free for at least 12 months. So we still have not reached our goal of no injuries, but we need to acknowledge the commitment and focus of all of our coworkers to keeping each other healthy and also safe especially in the current environment.  
Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, Amcor had a strong first half of fiscal '21, ahead of our expectations, balanced across all businesses and regions. And that strong first half translates into higher expectations for the full year on the back of strong momentum in the base business. And so the second key message today is that we've raised our outlook for EPS growth, full year fiscal '21, to 10% to 14% on a constant currency basis. Third, we're also increasing cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and $200 million of additional share repurchases. And the fourth point is that we continue to believe Amcor has never been better positioned from an investment case perspective, and I'll spend a few minutes explaining why we believe that before I turn it over to Michael, who will describe the recent result in more detail.  
Slide 5 is a simple snapshot of Amcor today, and understanding who we are and what we do has to be the basis for understanding that investment case. The company has been around a long time, over 160 years, and is now the global leader in consumer packaging. And Amcor is a truly global company with scale positions in every major region, including over $3 billion of annual sales in faster-growing emerging markets, where we also have leadership in scale positions. Essentially, all of our sales are to fast-moving consumer or health care segments. And the health care business now generates around $2 billion of sales each year to the medical device and pharmaceutical markets, which are among the most attractive places to play in the packaging industry. And finally, regardless of whether they're operating in developed or emerging markets or in consumer or health care segments, all of our businesses go to market with differentiated innovation capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world.  
Slide 6 is another quick snapshot, this one to highlight Amcor's performance and track record over the last 10 years. And we've maintained, as a starting point, a consistent investment-grade capital structure despite several transformational transactions. And we've driven consistent sales and earnings growth and always had high cash conversion. And that cash flow has funded capital investment in the business and close to 30 acquisitions over this time period, along with share repurchases and a growing dividend with an attractive yield. And added together and shareholders have been rewarded as well as the company has delivered consistent operating performance.  
Now going forward, we expect our operating performance and cash flow to remain at least this strong, and our approach to allocating that cash is set out on Slide 7. This is not new. There's no changes here to this framework but it's worth just reviewing. We consistently generate significant free cash flow every year. And this year, our free cash flow will be nearly $1.1 billion and that number will grow over time. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A or share repurchases. And in addition, we'll continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend, which has historically yielded between 4% and 5%. Taken together, the EPS growth and dividend yield should result in 10% to 15% of shareholder value each year. And so while we've been delivering returns to shareholders at this level for a long time now, momentum is building in the business and we believe this is a special time for the company and our investors.  
Slide 8 is the slide we shared last year at our investor briefing and it remains relevant today. And we believe that the Amcor investment case is as strong now as it's ever been and we set out the reasons why in this slide. And several of the points I've made already, global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive markets, strong balance sheet and cash flow to fund growth and dividends and a consistent track record, and they're all important features of our investment case, but we also believe that momentum matters in business. And in that last respect -- in that respect, the last point on the slide might just be the most important. Momentum has been building across Amcor over the last couple of years, and we expect it to continue. And that should be clear from our recent performance, including the first half result and the increased full year guidance that we're announcing today.  
At the core of our investment case is the consistent organic growth Amcor generates in several ways, as set out on Slide 9. The starting point for the organic growth is the mix of growing end markets we play in, and that's especially true in emerging markets. We've had a long history of profitable participation and profitable growth in emerging markets. And high-impact locations like China and India continue to grow sales and profit at impressive rates, including in the most recent half.  
Managing our sales mix across higher-value, more packaging-intensive consumer end markets like protein and premium coffee and more differentiated product types like hot-fill containers or barrier films drives consistent margin expansion and volume growth over time. And we have a global health care business approaching $2 billion in sales from every region of the world and across the pharmaceutical and medical device segments.  
Innovation is also an important growth driver for Amcor and probably the area where we are the most differentiated from our competition. Our customers are launching new products in Amcor packaging regularly. We've highlighted a few examples here of new and actually more sustainable products commercialized in recent months, including an extension of our HeatFlex family of products with the world's first microwavable, recycle-ready pouch for food and some premium coffee packaging using a bio-based polymer.
And finally, a common thread that cuts across all of what we do is sustainability, which we believe is Amcor's greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation. 
A few more comments on Slide 10 to describe our comprehensive sustainability agenda, which includes our products but also our factories. Of course, we're deeply committed to the idea of responsible packaging and we're working with our partners upstream and downstream to address concerns about packaging waste in the environment. We've stepped up to take a leadership role in the development of responsible packaging, which we believe requires 3 things. The first is package design, which accounts for the full product life cycle in addition to the end-of-life or waste profile. And Amcor is uniquely positioned here with leading R&D and innovation capabilities to handle the package design requirements, and we pointed out some examples already in this presentation.  
The other 2 requirements for responsible packaging require collaboration with others across our value chain, and Amcor has been active in that way as well to help drive improvements in waste management and consumer participation. A couple of examples over the last 6 months help highlight that work. In one case, Amcor has joined with 35 leading brands and retailers in The Consumer Goods Forum and a CEO-led initiative to develop package design rules to deliver packaging that's easier and more cost-effective to recycle. In another example, we've extended our work with the Carbon Trust to launch a label that can be printed on pack to indicate reduced CO2 intensity and provide greater transparency to the carbon footprint reductions enabled by our packaging. And the value created through our work in these initiatives and the progress we've made across a range of other ESG areas, including our EnviroAction program in all of our plants to drive greenhouse gas reduction, waste and water reduction, continues to be recognized by leading independent organizations, most recently MSCI and Dow Jones.  
Turning now to a summary of our first half results on Slide 11. We had strong earnings growth with EPS up 16% in constant currency terms, including 7% organic growth and strength in both the Rigid Packaging and Flexibles segments. Demand for our products remain balanced across regions and businesses, resulting in volume and sales growth in every region and 3% for Amcor overall. The execution discipline and operating performance of the businesses drove cost performance, which also contributed to the organic profit growth. Roughly 6% of the EPS growth came from synergies from the Bemis acquisition, which was ahead of expectations, and cost synergies totaled an incremental $35 million pretax during the half. And lastly, benefits from share repurchases accounted for the remaining EPS growth.  
Free cash flow was in line with expectations, and our balance sheet remains strong. And the company returned $450 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first 6 months. Strength in the underlying business also enables us to increase cash returns to shareholders for the balance of the year. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.1175 per share, which is higher than the prior year. And we announced today an additional $200 million of share repurchases, bringing the total announced this year to $350 million, which we expect to complete during the remainder of FY '21.  
The key theme enabling the strong performance in the half across the company has been the ability of every one of our businesses to execute and outperform against the things that are within our control despite an incredibly challenging and volatile external environment. Safety, working capital, cost synergies, cost performance, innovation, in all of those areas, the execution has been outstanding and we could not be more pleased with the performance of our teams through the first 6 months of the year. The key message here is that Amcor had a strong first half with results ahead of expectations, and we have an improved outlook for the full year and increased dividends and share repurchases to go along with it. 
With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some additional color on the financial performance for the half year and the outlook for the rest of 2021."

I'll start with some comments on the Flexibles segment on Slide 12. Overall segment volumes were 2% higher than the prior year. As Ron mentioned, demand has been broad-based, with growth across all regions in the low to mid-single-digit range. From an end market perspective, we've seen solid growth in food, pet food and beverage categories. And this was partly offset by lower volumes in certain health care end markets, driven by reduced elective surgery rates and lower prescription trends.  
Higher volumes were partially offset by unfavorable price/mix, resulting in net sales being 1% higher than the first half of last year, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency and the pass-through of lower raw material costs. Adjusted EBIT for the period grew 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, driven by the higher volumes, strong operating cost performance and $30 million of cost synergy benefits, which I'll come back to in a moment. Particularly pleasing to see that performance of the Flexibles business continue to improve as we extract benefits from the Bemis acquisition, deliver innovative new products to support customer growth and operate our plants efficiently.  
Now turning to Slide 13 and synergies. So in terms of cost synergies related to the Bemis acquisition, the ability to continue delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and adjustments to our operating footprint has been exceptional despite the need to address some additional challenges prevented in a COVID environment. As Ron mentioned, we are tracking ahead of expectations with $35 million of benefits included in our first half results. And given the strong progress we have made across a range of synergy projects in the last 6 months, we now expect to deliver approximately $70 million in fiscal '21, which is at the top end of our previous guidance range. This means at the end of this fiscal year, we'll have reached $150 million of cumulative benefits. We also have good visibility to remaining initiatives, which leaves us very confident with regards to our original expectation of $180 million in cumulative benefits by the end of fiscal '22.  
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 14. In summary, the business delivered another outstanding result with organic growth driving year-to-date earnings 10% higher than the same period last year. Sales growth included a 6% increase in volume as well as a 4% price/mix benefit, including higher price to recover cost inflation in Latin America. Volume performance continues to be strong in North America, and mix was positive. Beverage volumes were up 9% compared with last year, and hot-fill container volumes were up 19%. 
There has been strong consumer demand across all beverage segments particularly in hot-fill categories, including juice and sports drinks, where Amcor also benefited from favorable customer mix. This strong demand reflects higher at-home consumption of packaged beverage products, and this has been supported by the work brand owners have done to increase the availability of multipacks across a wider range of product categories and through the launch of innovative brand extension and new health and wellness-orientated products in PET containers. Specialty container volumes are also higher as a result of continued growth in spirits, personal care and home cleaning categories.  
As a partial offset, volumes were marginally lower in Latin America. This represents a sequential improvement and trends generally improved through the current half. While we saw higher volumes in Brazil, Central America and Argentina, month-to-month variability continues and performance remains mixed by country in the region. Strong overall EBIT growth of 10% reflects good leverage from the 6% volume growth and favorable mix across the business, partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America, which were incurred in order to service the higher demand. So overall, we're happy with the performance of this business during the half year and believe we are well positioned to support customer needs and deliver continued growth.  
Moving to cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 15. Adjusted free cash flow of $276 million was higher than the prior year, excluding approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments that were deferred under the CARES Act from Q4 2020. And as a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year, and this outcome was in line with our expectations, which leaves us on track to deliver more than $1 billion in this financial year. We remain focused on improved working capital management, and execution has been strong across all businesses with our rolling 12-month average working capital sales ratio continuing to improve, closing at 8.2% for sales at the end of December. This represents more than a $300 million reduction in average working capital over the last 18 months since the Bemis acquisition.  
Our financial profile remains strong, and leverage is 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is in line with where we would expect to be at this time of the fiscal year. As Ron mentioned, with strong annual cash flow and an investment-grade credit rating, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in the many growth opportunities available to us as well as increased returns related through a growing dividend and further share repurchases.  
In terms of the outlook for fiscal 2021 full year on Slide 16, the strong start to the year through solid volume-driven organic growth and synergy outperformance as well as the momentum we see in the business are the 2 factors which have given us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance for the second consecutive quarter. We expect the business will continue to execute, deliver further synergy benefits and grow organically as a global supplier for essential consumer and health care products. However, we are also maintaining a reasonably wide range of outcomes for the remaining 6 months of our fiscal year, which is appropriate given the ongoing uncertainty and complexity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We now expect constant currency EPS growth range of 10% to 14%. And while we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between $1 billion to $1.1 billion, we see more opportunities to deliver cash flow towards the top half of that range.  
To recap, the business is performing very well. Growth from organic sources and synergies is strong, our financial profile remains solid, and we are positioned to deliver another year of EPS growth in 2021, which will be ahead of our original expectations. 
So with that, I'll hand it back to Ron."

There's some additional sales going through multipacks and big-box retailers, which are certainly helping. There's an introduction of some new products. Our customer mix has been quite favorable.

So it's very difficult to predict that aspect of it. But I think some of the underlying trends around new product launches, multipack sales, some of our particular customers gaining share, those things, we would expect to continue. But all of that is incorporated into our overall guidance for the full fiscal year."

Now it's also getting increasingly difficult to pull apart what's a synergy versus what's a base business driver. I mean as you can imagine, the businesses are completely integrated now.  
As far as what's driving the performance, generally speaking, I think we've probably exceeded our expectations across the 3 big cost synergy buckets: so overheads which came out faster and probably yielded a bit more benefit than we would have thought; the procurement savings have been higher than we would have expected; and footprint, which is building momentum, is also positively contributing. And I guess if we're thinking about this year in particular, we've gotten some more footprint benefits than we thought we might be able to given the COVID backdrop, which makes those projects difficult to execute."

And the conclusion we've come to is that we really had no net impact one way or the other. And the way we get there, if you just take the big chunks of drivers, we've had a lot of extra cost in the business and increasingly so as we've continued to operate. We've had lots of folks out on quarantine. We've had lots of overtime to backfill those people. We have lots of extra shipping going around in the rigids business. 
So there's a lot of costs to be borne in this environment, first of all. And then the offset to that is obviously some stronger volumes in certain segments, like the beverage segment that we talked about a minute or 2 ago. The offset is -- commercially is health care, which is a really high-margin, attractive, profitable segment for us, has been really soft. Medical device consumption generally has been very low with less elective procedures, surgeries and otherwise. Prescriptions have been way down. And so the sales in that health care business have been way off. So higher costs in many parts of the business, some strong sales in some segments like beverage offsetting some weak sales in medical and pharmaceutical. 
The net-net of all those puts and takes as we look at the business is really not much. And 3% sales growth is not too far off where we've been historically. We've been at about 2% over the last 5 or 6 years. And the profit growth is flowing from that plus the cost performance and synergies in the business. So I mean we do a lot of work on this and there's a lot of interest in it, but our conclusion is there's really no net impact."

I mean we aren't seeing people here in the States go to the grocery store with kind of returnable bags anymore. But at the same time, it seems like from a medium-term perspective, we are seeing kind of more discussion in Europe and even here in the U.S. to some degree of producers having to fund sort of end-of-life solutions to packaging, and that winds up getting embedded in the cost. So maybe if you could just give us a sense of kind of what you're seeing from a political and regulatory standpoint in just your main markets."

I would maybe broaden that to just say the general environment, political, consumer, customer and otherwise. I mean the short answer I would give you is -- you asked how we see that environment evolving. And the short answer, I would say, is it's improving. And it's improving for a couple of reasons, one that you highlighted already, which is that I think the value of packaging and the role it plays in food and health care has become even more evident over the last 12 months. I don't know if we need to spend a lot of time explaining that, but I think the idea of packaged food is clear. I think the distribution of medicines and now we see vaccines and how important packaging is and the delivery devices are in that process. So I think the value of packaging has increased in the eyes of pretty much any observer, full stop.  
As it relates to plastic, I think the other thing that's happening, which is quite helpful, is an increasing focus on greenhouse gases and climate. And I think as people and stakeholders get more and more educated holistically on the environmental impacts of different types of packaging, I think increasingly, plastic scores pretty well. And that's why we continue to see our customers very focused on finding better alternatives for the end of life of their packaging but increasingly focused on doing what they're doing today with lighter weight and better functionality.  
I think the point you made about funding waste collection, extended producer responsibility, things like that, that has a role because clearly, we need the waste management infrastructure in place around the world to address the waste problem that we have and that needs to be funded. And there are good, successful models where funding that's generated through EPRs goes directly to waste infrastructure and can certainly help alleviate the problem. There's nothing wrong with that. We're in favor of well-designed EPRs as long as they're focused and targeted at the right level of infrastructure. So generally speaking, the environment has improved. We expect it to continue to improve as people get more educated on the total topic."

And that's because of the differentiation that we're going to bring to the more complicated aspects of the whole equation. So when we look at some of the products we've launched in the last 3, 4, 5 months that are more sustainable, if we look at the retortable pouch for pet food and then the human food version that we launched with Mars for microwavable rice, I mean that's just a different, better mousetrap. And we've got the only product in the market that's got that sustainability profile. 
So clearly, there's an opportunity there to take share. There's also obviously a higher level of value that's delivered to the customer in those 2 instances. We've got a PVDC-free shrink film called Eco-Tite, which is another example for protein. I mean again, all of these -- the more differentiated they are, the more opportunity for share and ultimately margin for the foreseeable future.

And the answer to that one is really there are no technical thresholds, Kyle. I mean we're making containers pretty much for every segment now at 100% PCR in the rigids business. The consumption of recycled resin in the rigids business has dramatically increased in the last 18 months even despite the COVID backdrop. So we've gone from about 4% or 5% of the resin that we processed to exiting December at about 10% of the total resin that we process in that business, and that number will go up again by June. 
So there really is no limit. There's no technical limit to the amount of recycled content we can use in the container. We're making plenty with all PCR. The constraint may be, at a point in time not too far into the future, a limitation on supply. And so we, along with our customers and consumers, in fact, obviously, are sending every demand signal possible that there is going to be an appetite to source PCR.

Those are really good examples of having a differentiated product and a differentiated offering that even the customers now are trying to reconcile and get their heads around in terms of what they can and can't do. The AmLite structure, the basic chemistry behind it, is it's got wide applications. So we've launched the product for pet food first. And then we've also more recently announced a rice package that essentially uses similar technology. The demand has been really far exceeded our expectations. And now we're going to have to scale up the capacity, which is a good thing to deliver against that demand. But it's a good example of solving a problem that didn't seem to have a really easy answer maybe 12 months ago for these big brand owners and also their smaller competitors. So I'd say watch this space on AmLite. There's incredible appetite not only from the European customer base where the product was first launched but also around the world. India, Brazil, obviously North America, China, there are kind of advanced orders or a book build, if you will, taking place globally for that structure. 
On Eco-Tite, this is a recycle-ready structure, but maybe even more importantly right now, it's a PVDC structure -- or PVDC-free structure, sorry, for protein, which is also a major concern for many brand owners to get PVDC and chlorides out of their packaging. And so this one has been targeted at the European protein market in the first instance. There's a lot of take-up there where that material is of particularly high concern. It's pretty early days, but I would expect that demand to start to also come from the other regions of the world as well. 
So I mean you alluded to it. Neither of these products are going to change the overall revenue profile of the company in a given quarter. But over time, the cumulative momentum of products like these is going to help generate good top line growth and good margin."

In fact, we had a modest pickup in the base business organic growth, let's say, from Q1 into Q2. Q2 was modestly higher than Q1 from an organic growth perspective. I think what you're seeing is just the comp, just the year-on-year impact of the synergy capture, which in the prior year was 3 to 6 to 9 months into the acquisition, and a lot of low-hanging fruit drove higher synergy benefits in those first couple of periods. So we're just cycling higher levels of synergy in the prior year. And over time, that's going to continue to dissipate as a comp.

We also, on the other end of the spectrum, do advanced technology development on material science, films, barriers and things that will benefit the business in the medium term. And in the middle is where most of the spend is, which is application development, product development and product commercialization. If I was to use the 80/20 rule, I would say probably 70% or 80% of it is in that middle area."

So when we talk about extraordinary cost to service extraordinary demand, that is one of the outcomes of running at very, very high capacity utilization, probably too high over time. Now we don't expect that to continue, as we've talked about. But other than that segment -- and then the inverse would be true in health care, where the demand has been soft.

Joining me on the line, as Tracey indicated, is Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin with some prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. 
Starting with Slide 3. We begin every meeting at Amcor with safety so we'll start today with safety as well. And this year, our safety performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we've reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% in the first 9 months of the year, and all of our business groups reported fewer injuries, with over half of our sites remaining injury-free for the last 12 months or more. 
And of course, over the last year, we've also been equally focused on keeping our co-workers healthy as well as safe. And as the COVID pandemic continues to present challenges in many countries, maintaining our protocols and our vigilance remains a top priority for our teams around the world who also understand the critical role we play in helping maintain availability of essential health care and food products. Given the continued challenges of navigating the pandemic, we're particularly pleased with our safety performance so far this year, and we remain confident that our objective of no injuries is, in fact, possible. 
Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, our year-to-date financial results have been strong and ahead of expectations, with organic momentum continuing through the year such that the March quarter has been our strongest thus far this year despite the operating environment remaining dynamic and volatile, maybe even more so over the last few months. Our teams have navigated that volatility by demonstrating an exceptional ability to stay focused on the key business drivers within our control, to respond quickly as conditions change and to execute to deliver results despite the circumstances. 
Second message here is that the strong performance translates into higher expectations for the 2021 fiscal year, and we've raised our outlook for full year EPS growth to 14% to 15% on a constant currency basis. And third, we're actively investing in several growth initiatives, which illustrate the range of opportunities we have over the medium term to maintain our momentum. The strong result, increased guidance and growth investment examples demonstrate the strength of our investment case, which I'll touch on briefly on Slide 5 before turning to the results in more detail. 
The Amcor investment case is set out on Slide 5 and it's one we've shared a few times this year. We believe the investment case is as strong as ever and this slide sets out the reasons why, including our global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive end markets, strong balance sheet and significant annual cash flow of more than $1 billion and growing to fund growth investments and dividends. And lastly, momentum's been building, which you can see in our upgraded guidance and we believe that will continue. 
Looking ahead into fiscal '22, we'd expect EPS growth to benefit from continued organic growth, additional synergies from the Bemis acquisition, a lower share count after the repurchases during FY '20 and '21 and the value that will be created from the $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow that will remain after CapEx and dividends. So the Amcor investment case has not changed and that's part of the message here today. Despite volatility in our operating environment and maybe even more so because of that volatility, the Amcor investment fundamentals remain very attractive and will continue to generate total value of 10% to 15% each year across EPS growth and dividends. 
Slide 6 includes the actual outcomes of that investment case over the last decade. Over this period, we've always maintained an investment-grade capital structure, we've delivered consistent sales and profit growth, including margin expansion organically through multiple economic and commodity cycles and we've consistently paid out a compelling dividend. And that growth and yield has been supported by best-in-class free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, which have also contributed to strong total returns to shareholders as well. 
Organic growth has always been a key driver of our overall financial performance, and that will become increasingly evident going forward. Slide 7 highlights 3 of the key organic growth drivers for Amcor. The starting point on the left is the set of growing end markets we serve around the world. Now Amcor has substantial positions in several higher-growth, higher value-add, more packaging-intensive segments like health care, protein and premium coffee or hot fill beverage containers and barrier films. In each of these segments, market growth tends to track higher than average. And in each one, we have differentiated positions -- scale positions, differentiated products and global leverage opportunities. 
Second, emerging markets will also continue to be a key source of organic growth for Amcor. We've got a scale emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales from 27 profitable emerging market businesses where we benefit from leadership positions and differentiated capabilities and where we have a long history of profitable growth. 
And third, growth enabled by innovation, which is an area where we continue to differentiate ourselves from competition and we're investing to extend that lead. All of our businesses go to market with world-class innovation and R&D capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world, particularly around sustainability, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
We're also allocating capital and actively investing for growth in a number of areas and Slide 8 shows 2 examples. First, the example on the left. Within a few weeks, we will expect to begin commissioning a major capacity expansion for one of our aluminum-based product segments at a flexible packaging plant in Switzerland. Now this investment will support the continued high growth of the premium coffee segment and is underwritten by a long-term supply agreement with a key customer. We've made a number of similar investments over the years and several recently where we have real long-term partnerships with higher-growth customers who value the various ways Amcor can help them grow. 
In the other example on the right-hand side of the slide, in the last quarter, we began construction of a new greenfield plant in China to add capacity to our business in that high-growth market where we already maintain a leadership position and healthy financial profile. The new state-of-the-art plant will be the largest in Amcor's China network and will start off by the end of calendar 2022 to support a range of global and local customers, primarily in the food and personal care segments. 
And turning to Slide 9. Last week, we announced a corporate venture type investment in ePac, a relatively new startup in the flexible packaging space, who has leveraged technology and a unique business model to grow to $100 million in sales in just over 4 years. Now as excited as we are to work with ePac, the key point of this slide is to make clear our intentions to do more with regard to open innovation and corporate venturing generally so that we can complement our internal innovation capabilities with great external ideas from all around the world. We're looking forward to exploring opportunities across new packaging products, processes and business models and will be much more systematic and purposeful in this area. 
And moving to Slide 10, it remains very clear to us that our best and most exciting opportunity for growth and differentiation will come from the development of more sustainable packaging. More sustainable packaging means responsible packaging, starting with better package design. And on that dimension, which needs to take into account the full product life cycle, there's no one better positioned in the industry than Amcor, and we're demonstrating that with a steady stream of new product platforms and launches around the world. 
Waste management and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across our value chain. And Amcor has been actively partnering with others in both areas to drive scalable solutions and real impact, and I'll describe some of the progress we're making on the next slide. 
The KitKat example on the left is a great one because it demonstrates the potential for Amcor to use chemically-recycled resin in food-grade flexible packaging, and it also highlights the level of collaboration that's possible across the full value chain to make it happen, in this case, in Australia. In the middle is AmSky, which is a breakthrough innovation launched by Amcor just last week. Now Amcor created the world's first recycle-ready thermoform blister packaging by eliminating PVC without compromising functionality or the consumer experience. And AmSky is an exciting development, which has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, particularly for solid pharmaceuticals but also highlights the potential to eliminate PVC and other packaging segments as well. 
The example on the right-hand side of the slide is another one that brings to life the concept of responsible packaging with a real example in practice, in this case, in the U.K. The supermarket rollout of this rice product in a recycle-ready microwavable pouch made with Amcor's HeatFlex technology coincided with a number of U.K. retailers announcing in-store trials to collect and recycle flexible packaging. And this 1 demonstrates that responsible packaging design enabled by Amcor can catalyze change and motivate progress on the waste management and consumer participation requirements as well. 
And finally in March, Amcor also took an executive committee role in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a group whose mission is fully aligned with our vision for responsible packaging through design, infrastructure, innovation and consumer participation. 
Turning now to a summary of our results on Slide 12. The business has delivered strong year-to-date earnings growth, with EPS up 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. And of that EPS growth, 7% was organic as overall demand for our products has remained healthy and combined with outstanding execution has resulted in organic growth continuing to build each quarter. 6% of the EPS growth comes from incremental Bemis acquisition synergies, which have reached $55 million so far this fiscal year. We continue to progress ahead of initial expectations, and we're well positioned to deliver at least $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '22. And the remaining 3% EPS growth reflects benefits from share repurchases in fiscal '20 and '21. 
Free cash flow in the balance sheet continue to be strong and in line with our expectations. And we've returned more than $850 million so far this year of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. So the key message here is that we're executing very well, building momentum, delivering strong growth and cash returns to shareholders. With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some further detail."

Overall sales were 1% higher than the prior year and this was all driven by higher volumes. Demand has remained relatively broad-based with growth in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions while Europe was in line with last year. Through the last 9 months, we have consistently seen solid growth across a broad range of end markets, including in higher-value end markets like protein, coffee, cheese and pet food. And this has been partly offset by lower health care volumes, driven by fewer elective surgeries and live prescription trends, which began back in the June quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, reflecting volume growth, $45 million of cost synergy benefits and strong cost performance and management. It's worth noting here that increases in raw materials have remained manageable. Given the diversity of the materials we buy and the multiple reasons in which we consume those materials, combined with the strong commercial capabilities that we have built for over a decade as part of the Amcor Way. 
The business also continues to extract the financial and strategic benefits from the Bemis acquisition, which is covered on Slide 14. We acquired a high-quality, well-invested business, which has delivered consistent earnings growth since the date of the acquisition. In terms of cost synergies, our teams have done a great job of delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and by optimizing our footprint. Year-to-date, we've delivered $55 million in benefits, and we continue to expect this will increase to approximately $70 million for the full year. At the end of fiscal 2021, cumulative benefits will have reached $150 million, and we expect to deliver at least $180 million of total cost synergies by the end of fiscal '22. 
It's also exciting to see examples of collaboration across the regions as we leverage our capabilities and differentiated product offering to support customer growth. For instance, our business in China, Australia and Brazil have all secured differentiated packaging for protein and pet food applications from other Amcor regions across the globe. There are many examples like this and more in the pipeline to come through. 
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 15. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results, driven by strong consumer demand. Sales growth included a 4% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes are 7% higher than last year, and hot fill container volumes are up 13%. 
We have seen another quarter of strong consumer demand for PET packaged beverages, particularly in hot fill categories, including juice, ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks. This strong demand has filled capacity across our network and reflects higher consumer demand, innovative brand extensions and new product launches and formats. 
Year-to-date, specialty container volumes were higher than the prior period, with growth in certain categories, including spirits, personal care and home cleaning. And volumes in Latin America were also 2% higher than last year with growth delivered in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. The EBIT growth of 9% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business."

Operator, I'll pick it up from here. It's Ron Delia. I'll just pick up from where Michael left off. Michael was just summarizing the rigid container story -- Rigid Packaging segment. Sorry about that for those on the line. I think he was just updating on the specialty container volumes, which were higher than the prior period with growth in a number of categories. 
And then volumes in Latin America, 2% higher than last year with growth particularly in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. EBIT growth in the segment of 9% reflects that higher volume and favorable mix across the business, partially offset by higher labor costs and transportation costs as well. Rigid containers has rapidly become -- it's rapidly become evident the preference for rigid containers, given they're recyclability, lightweight, resealable and hygiene profile, as well as having the lowest carbon footprint. And the business has continued to benefit from these trends. 
We've doubled the use of PCR, post-consumer recycled resin over 2 -- over the last 2 years even while navigating the pandemic. And we continue to launch new products made of 100% PCR. In fact, today, almost all of our sites in North America are converting PCR along with virgin resin. 
We move on to Slide 16. Adjusted free cash flow of $360 million was in line with prior year. However, this includes approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments deferred under the CARES Act in the Q4 of FY '20. Excluding that timing variance, adjusted free cash flow is approximately 10% higher than last year and is in line with our expectations. 
Our financial profile is solid. Leverage is at 3x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, and this is lower than last year and in line with what we'd expect at the end of the March quarter, given the seasonality of the cash flows in the business. So with strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity to invest as well as to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders, as we have this year already, through a growing dividend and further share repurchases. And in fact, in 9 months so far this year, we've returned over $850 million to shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 17, which is the outlook slide. You'll find the latest view here, which is a revised or an increased outlook for the year. The continued strong performance of the business and the organic momentum has been built -- that has been building gives us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance. We expect constant currency EPS growth of 14% to 15% for the full year, which is comparable to and higher than the 10% to 14% guidance provided in February and includes an unfavorable EPS impact from businesses we've disposed of over the last 12 months of approximately 1%. So to be clear, the constant currency EPS growth for this year would have been 15% to 16% had the disposals not occur. In terms of cash flow, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between USD 1 billion and USD 1.1 billion. 
In closing today, on Slide 18, Amcor has delivered a strong result ahead of expectations and organic momentum has continued. This has translated into higher expectations for the full year and we've raised our outlook for fiscal '21. We're actively investing in the future, and these investments, along with strong execution, will enable continued momentum and reinforce our belief that the Amcor investment case has never been stronger. Operator, with that, we'll finish our -- we finished our opening remarks and we're happy to open the line for questions."

This is a high-class problem in terms of another new product. Is there a way you could give us some form of a vitality index or some approximation how much of your sales right now where volumes are coming from products that you hadn't created, produced 2 years ago, 3 years ago, whatever time frame you want to use? That's question number 1. 
And then question number 2, recognizing you prefer to look at things on a year-to-date basis on a yearly basis, when we do some reverse engineering of the press releases, it looks -- this quarter versus last quarter, it looks like Flexibles saw a little bit of a slowdown, volumes might have been flat to slightly down. Can you give us some perspective in terms of what was happening in the third quarter market in some key products?"

Look, on the volatility index, it's not a measure that we use pervasively inside the company. I mean, I think the -- what we're really focused on is launching products that are commercializable and will have take-up in the market and then tracking the sales of each of those, none of which are material to the group, per se. But we think it's important to continue to demonstrate the vitality of our innovation pipeline because ultimately, that will contribute to the positive mix and the positive margin that we want to drive in the business. 
And so the ultimate vitality index for us is the margin expansion that we've generated period after period after period for well over 10 years now. That's the vitality index because what it says is that each new product that we sell today is a higher-margin product than the unit it's replacing from prior periods. So that's maybe the roundabout way of answering your first question. 
On Q3, we'll talk about Q3. I mean, we do tend to focus on the full year to try to orient the conversations in the longer term. But that being said, the third quarter was our strongest quarter of the year on a number of dimensions. We had increasing organic momentum -- profit momentum across both Rigids and Flexibles. And we're really pleased with the execution because the environment in the third quarter -- fiscal third quarter for us from an operating perspective was probably as difficult as it's been so far this year. 
As it relates to the sales side of things, yes. I mean, look, I think these businesses, both Rigids and Flexibles, will generate low single-digit growth over the long term. I think that's roughly where we've been -- where we were through 6 months. That's likely where we'll be at the end of the fiscal year. The 90-day period that was Q3 was a little bit softer in Flexibles, particularly because of the weakness, the ongoing weakness in the medical device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging. But more or less, we're consistent with our long-term trends in both businesses for this fiscal year at sort of low single digits."

I mean, last year at this time, we would have been describing pretty much a neutral impact from COVID, and that carried through then to the fourth quarter of FY '20 and that's pretty much been our experience. And that's because of the geographic diversity of the business. Last year, our Q3 would have seen a real strong negative impact in Asia, particularly in China, which is a business that generates a lot of growth for us. And we would have seen softness in other parts of the business compensating for some of the better sales in North America in the month of March last year as an example. 
The net-net of all that, last year wasn't really much. And so as we think about cycling comps this year, including the results that we're reporting today, there's really not much in it in terms of variation period to period related to COVID. And that's the perspective that I would offer looking forward as well. Our Q4, as I said to respond to George's question, it will be back at the end of this fiscal year and we'll be in the low single digits, which is where we would expect to be on any given year. So there's not -- it's not the sexiest answer I could give you but it's the reality of the diversified portfolio that we're operating."

These are commodity cycles that we experience every few years. If we look back over the last 10 years or so, it's probably maybe the third or fourth real pronounced spike that we've seen in our input costs. And so it's not new. It's something you deal with periodically. And the way we navigate is with lots of rigor and lots of precision. And I would say that, that rigor and that precision improves every time we go through one of these cycles. 
And I think that whether it's the shortening the pass-through lags on contracts, whether it's expanding the coverage of the materials that are subject to rising foam mechanisms and the like, I just think we get better at it with each year. And I can go back to each of those cyclical peaks over the last decade and kind of point to things that we've learned and that we've added to the toolkit so that the next time, the experience is less impactful. 
And I think that's what we're seeing now. We're not really -- obviously, we're wearing a headwind like everyone else, but it's not material enough to distort the results and it's certainly not holding back our expectations for the fiscal year. 
I think with Bemis, maybe Bemis is a segue into another dimension to this question, which is the diversification of our spend, which only got further enhanced or further diversified with the Bemis acquisition. So obviously, if we take the 2 business segments, you've got rigid packaging, which is largely PET-based, which operates in a much tighter lag, it's an easier administrative process, if you will, because it's really primarily [indiscernible] material. 
So when we talk about lags in Amcor's businesses, it's primarily in Flexibles. And in Flexibles, it's also important to remember that about 60% -- or maybe I'll say it the other way, about 40% of what we buy in the Flexibles segment is not polymer-based. It's aluminum, it's fiber and it's other things. So the spend from a commodity perspective is pretty well diversified. 
And then particularly in polymers, the other 60%, that's really split. It's split across 4 geographic regions and it's split across grades. And so the netting of that, the portfolio effect of that, again with the addition of Bemis, which is $4 billion out of the $9 billion of sales in that segment just creates more of a portfolio effect or a dampening or leveling effect. So we're more -- I'd say to summarize it, we're better at this and we -- and our portfolio is better positioned to withstand these kind of cyclical spikes."

I think we have to remember there were times over the last 9 or 12 months, I think, was the period you referenced, where raw materials also went down in some parts of the world. So I wouldn't read too much into the -- I think it would be very difficult to bridge back the commodity charts with the raw material impact on the revenue line, which is why we just break it out for you.

So none of that is necessarily a bad thing. 
I think on the reusable side of things, I'm not sure that's an Amcor issue, per se, particularly in France. But the consumer behavioral shift required for reuse at scale is just not something we've seen anywhere in the world yet. It doesn't mean it won't happen, but I think that's a big ask of the consumer at this stage, quite frankly, when we're trying to get them to recycle or compost."

The 2 just about net. 
And so again, I think somebody else asked the question earlier and I made the comment, as far as trying to find a comp and whether it's a negative or a positive, there's just not a whole lot in it for us.

And then there's some areas that we'd like to double down on or that represent bigger opportunities for us, I mean, obviously, Flexibles in Asia. We have a business that's well over $1 billion in sales but the market opportunity is enormous. So hopefully, we can supplement our growth there with M&A as 1 example. 
Probably another 1 would be in the rigid packaging space outside of beverage. We've got a big business growing well organically, but can we supplement that with further M&A? We certainly hope so. So those would be a couple of examples. But there's bolt-on opportunities across the board and we really hope to be active. 
Look, on folding cartons, it's a business that's about 8% of sales in Amcor. It's the industry leader in what it does because it's a very specialized type of folding carton, high graphic intensity and shapes and tactile features as well. So it's sort of the high end. It's not cereal boxes, per se. So it's a high-margin business that generates a lot of cash. And it's pretty core to our Flexibles perimeter because it's essentially a printing and converting business. And industrially, it looks exactly like our Flexibles businesses. In fact, some of the equipment is actually the same. 
So it's everybody as core as everything else and it's got a great financial profile. It's obviously got a different top line profile than the rest of the company. But from a return on capital and cash perspective, it's about as good as it gets."

That's been the big impact, really. The rest of it is -- the rest of the portfolio will continue to grow low single digits. The comp issue is sort of less meaningful everywhere else in the company, except for the negative impacts from the health care dynamics that I just referred to."

So I'll talk about ePac in a second, but the key point to take away here is that we're going to be much more purposeful and systematic in tapping into external ideas of all types. We believe and we have conviction that we have differentiated R&D capabilities in the company, but we're not naïve enough to think we've got all the great ideas out there. So that's really the headline message is that we're open for business if there's a great idea that somebody wants to help developing or wants to come talk to us about. 
ePac is a corporate venturing type investment. It's a minority stake in a business that is essentially a startup. It's about a 4-year-old business. Fantastic business. It's really exciting. It's a flexible packaging business in essence. And it's gone really from 0 to about $100 million in sales in 4 years. It's got about 15 sites, most of them are in the U.S. I think there's a couple outside the U.S. And we're really excited to learn from it, quite frankly. 
So the first objective is to learn and kind of leave it alone, and what we hope to learn is in a few areas. One is the commercial approach, which, as you point out, is geared towards smaller enterprises and it leverages short runs, quick turnarounds and also high quality. So that's -- there's a commercial learning opportunity for Amcor. I think industrially, the business is enabled by digital printing and some other kind of neat industrial aspects inside the 4 walls of a plant, which are also interesting to us. 
And then the third thing, honestly, is how does the business grow from 0 to $100 million in 4 years? And I think there's a whole lot we can learn, like any big company from a startup and how that happens, from a managerial and organizational perspective as well. So we're going to leave it alone a little bit, Adam, in the first instance, not a little bit. We're going to leave it alone and we're going to watch and listen and learn and then watch the space. I think you'll see different manifestations of those learnings benefit Amcor for many years to come."

Like the convention in the industry is that the raw material fluctuations are passed through to the marketplace. And so this is really -- the conversation about the lag or the P&L impact of changes in raw material prices is really about the commercial side of the business and the commercial capabilities, first of all, measuring what those changes are and then executing price increases to recover those costs. So that's the absolute key point here. 
And I think we have, I think, a pretty special approach to doing that, which goes all the way back, firstly, to understanding the profit of each order and each customer and each product. So I can talk more about that but that's the commercial side. 
On the procurement side, which I'd treat as a slightly different dimension, I think our procurement capabilities have evolved over the years. I think as we've gotten bigger, we've added people, we've added expertise, we've added IT systems. Our buy is broad. I think the fact that we're now a bigger buyer in the U.S. gives us visibility into the dynamics in this market that maybe we always had in Europe and did have as well in the U.S. As regional as the market can be at times, it absolutely has elements of a global market as well.

We probably would be at a higher level than 10% had it not been for some of the disruptions in the supply chain from the pandemic. 
And it's also pretty exciting that many of the new SKUs that we launched, and we've got a lot of new product examples scattered throughout our materials today, many of them are made with 100% PCR. And it's almost like electronic vehicles to some extent. We're not launching a lot of new products in PET that aren't leveraging PCR to some extent, and many of them are 100% PCR.

But we think a purposeful amount of investing on a regular basis will help us make sure that we're tapping into the best ideas out there. So I would say watch this space on this one. There'll be more to be said on this topic. 
On the investments in the recycling part of the value chain, look, never say never. We prefer not to put capital into parts of the value chain that are not necessarily areas we can be differentiated and unique in. We would prefer to be a demand catalyst and a source of demand for others who might put their capital in those spaces because it's more aligned with what they do. 
And then the other way that we hope to influence infrastructure development is through some of the collaborations and partnerships that we've entered into. And we announced recently that we signed up with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is not a new entity but 1 that we stayed close to for a couple of years and are really encouraged by the progress that, that group is making, particularly on the waste management side.

And then just briefly on the commercial side, I would say more broadly, I mean, I think there's examples of products transfers going in both directions. And we've called out a few examples. I mean, I wouldn't describe them as material yet but we've got some products going from the North American business into ANZ. I think we've got an example on Bega Cheese, individual wrap places. That's a good example of leveraging a structure from the U.S. legacy Bemis business into ANZ. 
We've got some examples going the other way from our New Zealand dairy film business going to the U.S. market. So I think you'll see more and more of that. It's a really interesting and complementary mix of segment participation that the businesses have had historically. If I look in North America, the big positions in protein and hard cheese, processed cheese that we acquired are absolutely additive for our portfolio in Europe. And then the food and coffee positions that we've had, in Europe, historically, are completely new and additive to the Bemis -- legacy Bemis platform in North America. 
So I think we'll see more and more of that. I think our way to probably describe that will be through examples as much as anything else. But I think we're starting to see it already."

Joining me on the line, as Tracey indicated, is Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin with some prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A.
Starting with Slide 3. We begin every meeting at Amcor with safety, so we'll start today with safety as well. And this year, our safety performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we've reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% in the first 9 months of the year, and all of our business groups reported fewer injuries, with over half of our sites remaining injury-free for the last 12 months or more.
And of course, over the last year, we've also been equally focused on keeping our co-workers healthy as well as safe. And as the COVID pandemic continues to present challenges in many countries, maintaining our protocols and our vigilance remains a top priority for our teams around the world who also understand the critical role we play in helping maintain availability of essential health care and food products. Given the continued challenges of navigating the pandemic, we're particularly pleased with our safety performance so far this year, and we remain confident that our objective of no injuries is, in fact, possible.
Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, our year-to-date financial results have been strong and ahead of expectations, with organic momentum continuing through the year such that the March quarter has been our strongest thus far this year despite the operating environment remaining dynamic and volatile, maybe even more so over the last few months. Our teams have navigated that volatility by demonstrating an exceptional ability to stay focused on the key business drivers within our control, to respond quickly as conditions change and to execute to deliver results despite the circumstances.
The second message here is that the strong performance translates into higher expectations for the 2021 fiscal year, and we've raised our outlook for full year EPS growth to 14% to 15% on a constant currency basis. And third, we're actively investing in several growth initiatives, which illustrate the range of opportunities we have over the medium term to maintain our momentum. The strong result, increased guidance and growth investment examples demonstrate the strength of our investment case, which I'll touch on briefly on Slide 5 before returning to the results in more detail.
The Amcor investment case is set out on Slide 5 and it's one we've shared a few times this year. We believe the investment case is as strong as ever, and this slide sets out the reasons why, including our global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive end markets, strong balance sheet and significant annual cash flow of more than $1 billion, and growing, to fund growth investments and dividends. And lastly, momentum's been building, which you can see in our upgraded guidance, and we believe that will continue.
Looking ahead into fiscal '22, we would expect EPS growth to benefit from continued organic growth, additional synergies from the Bemis acquisition, a lower share count after the repurchases during FY '20 and '21 and the value that will be created from the $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow that will remain after CapEx and dividends. So the Amcor investment case has not changed and that's part of the message here today. Despite volatility in our operating environment and maybe even more so because of that volatility, the Amcor investment fundamentals remain very attractive and will continue to generate total value of 10% to 15% each year across EPS growth and dividends.
Slide 6 includes the actual outcomes of that investment case over the last decade. Over this period, we've always maintained an investment-grade capital structure. We've delivered consistent sales and profit growth, including margin expansion organically through multiple economic and commodity cycles. And we've consistently paid out a compelling dividend. And that growth and yield has been supported by best-in-class free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, which have also contributed to strong total returns to shareholders as well.
Organic growth has always been a key driver of our overall financial performance, and that will become increasingly evident going forward. Slide 7 highlights 3 of the key organic growth drivers for Amcor. The starting point on the left is the set of growing end markets we serve around the world. Now Amcor has substantial positions in several higher-growth, higher value-add, more packaging-intensive segments like health care, protein and premium coffee or hot fill beverage containers and barrier films. In each of these segments, market growth tends to track higher than average. And in each one, we have differentiated positions -- scale positions, differentiated products and global leverage opportunities.
Second, emerging markets will also continue to be a key source of organic growth for Amcor. We've got a scale emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales from 27 profitable emerging market businesses, where we benefit from leadership positions and differentiated capabilities, and where we have a long history of profitable growth.
And third, growth enabled by innovation, which is an area where we continue to differentiate ourselves from competition, and we're investing to extend that lead. All of our businesses go to market with world-class innovation and R&D capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world, particularly around sustainability, which I'll come back to in a minute.
We're also allocating capital and actively investing for growth in a number of areas, and Slide 8 shows 2 examples. First, the example on the left. Within a few weeks, we will expect to begin commissioning a major capacity expansion for one of our aluminum-based product segments at a Flexibles Packaging plant in Switzerland. Now this investment will support the continued high growth of the premium coffee segment and is underwritten by a long-term supply agreement with a key customer. We've made a number of similar investments over the years and several recently where we have real long-term partnerships with higher-growth customers who value the various ways Amcor can help them grow.
In the other example on the right-hand side of the slide, in the last quarter, we began construction of a new greenfield plant in China to add capacity to our business in that high-growth market, where we already maintain a leadership position and healthy financial profile. The new state-of-the-art plant will be the largest in Amcor's China network and will start up by the end of calendar 2022 to support a range of global and local customers, primarily in the food and personal care segments.
And turning to Slide 9. Last week, we announced a corporate venture-type investment in ePac, a relatively new startup in the flexible packaging space, who has leveraged technology and a unique business model to grow to $100 million in sales in just over 4 years. Now as excited as we are to work with ePac, the key point of this slide is to make clear our intentions to do more with regard to open innovation and corporate venturing generally so that we can complement our internal innovation capabilities with great external ideas from all around the world. We're looking forward to exploring opportunities across new packaging products, processes and business models and will be much more systematic and purposeful in this area.
And moving to Slide 10, it remains very clear to us that our best and most exciting opportunity for growth and differentiation will come from the development of more sustainable packaging. More sustainable packaging means responsible packaging, starting with better package design. And on that dimension, which needs to take into account the full product life cycle, there's no one better positioned in the industry than Amcor and we're demonstrating that with a steady stream of new product platforms and launches around the world.
Waste management and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across our value chain. And Amcor has been actively partnering with others in both areas to drive scalable solutions and real impact, and I'll describe some of the progress we're making on the next slide.
The KITKAT example on the left is a great one because it demonstrates the potential for Amcor to use chemically recycled resin in food-grade flexible packaging, and it also highlights the level of collaboration that's possible across the full value chain to make it happen, in this case, in Australia. In the middle is AmSky, which is a breakthrough innovation launched by Amcor just last week. Now Amcor created the world's first recycle-ready thermoform blister packaging by eliminating PVC without compromising functionality or the consumer experience. And AmSky is an exciting development, which has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, particularly for solid-dose pharmaceuticals, but it also highlights the potential to eliminate PVC and other packaging segments as well.
The example on the right-hand side of the slide is another one that brings to life the concept of responsible packaging with a real example in practice, in this case, in the U.K. The supermarket rollout of this rice product in a recycle-ready microwavable pouch made with Amcor's HeatFlex technology coincided with a number of U.K. retailers announcing in-store trials to collect and recycle flexible packaging. And this one demonstrates that responsible packaging design enabled by Amcor can catalyze change and motivate progress on the waste management and consumer participation requirements as well.
And finally, in March, Amcor also took an Executive Committee role in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a group whose mission is fully aligned with our vision for responsible packaging through design, infrastructure, innovation and consumer participation.
Turning now to a summary of our results on Slide 12. The business has delivered strong year-to-date earnings growth, with EPS up 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. And of that EPS growth, 7% was organic as overall demand for our products has remained healthy and combined with outstanding execution, has resulted in organic growth continuing to build each quarter. 6% of the EPS growth comes from incremental Bemis acquisition synergies, which have reached $55 million so far this fiscal year. We continue to progress ahead of initial expectations, and we're well positioned to deliver at least $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '22. And the remaining 3% EPS growth reflects benefits from share repurchases in fiscal '20 and '21.
Free cash flow in the balance sheet continue to be strong and in line with our expectations. And we've returned more than $850 million so far this year of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. So the key message here is that we're executing very well, building momentum, delivering strong growth and cash returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some further detail."

Overall sales were 1% higher than the prior year and this was all driven by higher volumes. Demand has remained relatively broad-based, with growth in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions, while Europe was in line with last year. Through the last 9 months, we have consistently seen solid growth across a broad range of end markets, including in higher-value end markets like protein, coffee, cheese and pet food. And this has been partly offset by lower health care volumes driven by fewer elective surgeries and lower prescription trends, which began back in the June quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, reflecting volume growth, $45 million of cost synergy benefits and strong cost performance and management. It's worth noting here that increases in raw materials have remained manageable, given the diversity of the materials we buy and the multiple reasons in which we consume those materials, combined with the strong commercial capabilities that we have built for over a decade as part of The Amcor Way.
The business also continues to extract the financial and strategic benefits from the Bemis acquisition, which is covered on Slide 14. We acquired a high-quality, well-invested business, which has delivered consistent earnings growth since the date of the acquisition. In terms of cost synergies, our teams have done a great job of delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and by optimizing our footprint. Year-to-date, we have delivered $55 million in benefits, and we continue to expect this will increase to approximately $70 million for the full year. At the end of fiscal 2021, cumulative benefits will have reached $150 million, and we expect to deliver at least $180 million of total cost synergies by the end of fiscal '22.
It's also exciting to see examples of collaboration across the regions as we leverage our capabilities and differentiated product offering to support customer growth. For instance, our business in China, Australia and Brazil have all secured differentiated packaging for protein and pet food applications from other Amcor regions across the globe. There are many examples like this and more in the pipeline to come through.
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 15. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results driven by strong consumer demand. Sales growth included a 4% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes are 7% higher than last year, and hot fill container volumes are up 13%.
We have seen another quarter of strong consumer demand for PET packaged beverages, particularly in hot fill categories, including juice, ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks. This strong demand has built capacity across our network and reflects higher consumer demand, innovative brand extensions and new product launches and formats.
Year-to-date, Specialty Container volumes were higher than the prior period, with growth in certain categories, including spirits, personal care and home cleaning. And volumes in Latin America were also 2% higher than last year, with growth delivered in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. The EBIT growth of 9% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business.

Operator, I'll pick it up from here. It's Ron Delia. I'll just pick up from where Michael left off. Michael was just summarizing the Rigid container story -- Rigid Packaging segment. Sorry about that, for those on the line. I think he was just updating on the Specialty Container volumes, which were higher than the prior period, with growth in a number of categories. And then volumes in Latin America, 2% higher than last year, with growth, particularly in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. EBIT growth in the segment of 9% reflects that higher volume and favorable mix across the business, partially offset by higher labor costs and transportation costs as well.
Rigid containers has rapidly become -- it's rapidly become evident the preference for Rigid containers, given their recyclability, lightweight, resealability and hygiene profile as well as having the lowest carbon footprint. And the business has continued to benefit from these trends.
We've doubled the use of PCR, post-consumer recycled resin, over 2 -- over the last 2 years even while navigating the pandemic. And we continue to launch new products made of 100% PCR. In fact, today, almost all of our sites in North America are converting to PCR along with virgin resin.
We move on to Slide 16. Adjusted free cash flow of $360 million was in line with prior year. However, this includes approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments deferred under the CARES Act in the Q4 of FY '20. Excluding that timing variance, adjusted free cash flow is approximately 10% higher than last year and is in line with our expectations.
Our financial profile is solid. Leverage is at 3x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, and this is lower than last year and in line with what we would expect at the end of the March quarter given the seasonality of the cash flows in the business. So with strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity to invest as well as to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders, as we have this year already, through a growing dividend and further share repurchases. And in fact, in 9 months so far this year, we've returned over $850 million to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 17, which is the outlook slide. You'll find the latest view here, which is a revised or an increased outlook for the year. The continued strong performance of the business and the organic momentum has been built -- that has been building gives us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance. And we expect constant currency EPS growth of 14% to 15% for the full year, which is comparable to and higher than the 10% to 14% guidance provided in February and includes an unfavorable EPS impact from businesses we've disposed of over the last 12 months of approximately 1%. So to be clear, the constant currency EPS growth for this year would have been 15% to 16% had the disposals not occur. In terms of cash flow, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between USD 1 billion and USD 1.1 billion.
In closing today, on Slide 18, Amcor has delivered a strong result ahead of expectations, and organic momentum has continued. This has translated into higher expectations for the full year, and we've raised our outlook for fiscal '21. We're actively investing in the future, and these investments, along with strong execution, will enable continued momentum and reinforce our belief that the Amcor investment case has never been stronger.
Operator, with that, we'll finish our -- we've finished our opening remarks, and we're happy to open the line for questions."

I guess, first off, it seems like every week, we get another press release from Amcor, and this is a [ high-class problem ] in terms of another new product. Is there a way you could give us some form of a vitality index or some approximation, how much of your sales right now where volumes are coming from products that you hadn't created, produced 2 years ago, 3 years ago, whatever time frame you want to use? That's question number 1.
And then question number 2, recognizing you prefer to look at things on a year-to-date basis, on a yearly basis, when we do some reverse engineering of the press releases, it looks -- this quarter versus last quarter, it looks like Flexibles saw a little bit of a slowdown, volumes might have been flat to slightly down. Can you give us some perspective in terms of what was happening in the third quarter by market and some key products?"

Look, on the volatility index, it's not a measure that we use pervasively inside the company. I mean I think the -- what we're really focused on is launching products that are commercialized -- commercializable and will have take-up in the market and then tracking the sales of each of those, none of which are material to the group per se. But we think it's important to continue to demonstrate the vitality of our innovation pipeline because ultimately, that will contribute to the positive mix and the positive margin that we want to drive in the business.
And so the ultimate vitality index for us is the margin expansion that we've generated period after period after period for well over 10 years now. That's the vitality index because what it says is that each new product that we sell today is a higher-margin product than the unit it's replacing from prior periods. So that's maybe the roundabout way of answering your first question.
On Q3, we'll talk about Q3. I mean we do tend to focus on the full year to try to orient the conversations in the longer term. But that being said, the third quarter was our strongest quarter of the year on a number of dimensions. We had increasing organic momentum -- profit momentum across both Rigids and Flexibles. And we're really pleased with the execution because the environment in the third quarter, fiscal third quarter for us from an operating perspective, was probably as difficult as it's been so far this year.
As it relates to the sales side of things, yes. I mean look, I think these businesses, both Rigids and Flexibles, will generate low single-digit growth over the long term. I think that's roughly where we've been -- where we were through 6 months. That's likely where we'll be at the end of the fiscal year. The 90-day period that was Q3 was a little bit softer in Flexibles, particularly because of the weakness, the ongoing weakness in the medical device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging. But more or less, we're consistent with our long-term trends in both businesses for this fiscal year at sort of low single digits."

I mean last year, at this time, we would have been describing pretty much a neutral impact from COVID, and that carried through then for the fourth quarter of FY '20, and that's pretty much been our experience. And that's because of the geographic diversity of the business. Last year, our Q3 would have seen a real strong negative impact in Asia, particularly in China, which is a business that generates a lot of growth for us. And we would have seen softness in other parts of the business, compensating for some of the better sales in North America in the month of March last year as an example.
The net-net of all that, last year, wasn't really much. And so as we think about cycling comps this year, including the results that we're reporting today, there's really not much in it in terms of variation period-to-period related to COVID. And that's the perspective that I would offer looking forward as well. Our Q4, as I said to respond to George's question, it will be back at the end of this fiscal year and will be in the low single digits, which is where we would expect to be on any given year. And so there's not -- it's not the sexiest answer I could give you, but it's the reality of the diversified portfolio that we're operating."

These are commodity cycles that we experience every few years. If we look back over the last 10 years or so, it's probably maybe the third or fourth real pronounced spike that we've seen in our input costs. And so it's not new. It's something you deal with periodically. And the way we navigate is with lots of rigor and lots of precision. And I would say that, that rigor and that precision improves every time we go through one of these cycles.
And I think that whether it's the shortening the pass-through lags on contracts, whether it's expanding the coverage of the materials that are subject to rise and fall mechanisms and the like, I just think we get better at it with each year. And I can go back to each of those cyclical peaks over the last decade and kind of point to things that we've learned and that we've added to the toolkit so that in the next time, the experience is less impactful. And I think that's what we're seeing now. We're not really -- obviously, we're wearing a headwind like everyone else, but it's not material enough to distort the results, and it's certainly not holding back our expectations for the fiscal year.
I think with Bemis, maybe Bemis is a segue into another dimension to this question, which is the diversification of our spend, which only got further enhanced or further diversified with the Bemis acquisition. So obviously, if we take the 2 business segments, you've got rigid packaging, which is largely PET-based, which operates in a much tighter lag, it's an easier administrative process, if you will, because it's really primarily one material.
So when we talk about lags in Amcor's businesses, it's primarily in Flexibles. And in Flexibles, it's also important to remember that about 60% -- or maybe I'll say it the other way, about 40% of what we buy in the Flexibles segment is not polymer-based. It's aluminum, it's fiber, and it's other things. So the spend from a commodity perspective is pretty well-diversified.
And then particularly in polymers, the other 60%, that's really split. It's split across 4 geographic regions, and it's split across grades. And so the netting of that, the portfolio effect of that, again with the addition of Bemis, which is $4 billion out of the $9 billion of sales in that segment, just creates more of a portfolio effect or a dampening or a leveling effect. So we're more -- I would say, to summarize it, we're better at this and we -- and our portfolio is better positioned to withstand these kind of cyclical spikes."

I think we have to remember, there were times over the last 9 or 12 months, I think, was the period you referenced, where raw materials also went down in some parts of the world. And so I wouldn't read too much into the -- I think it would be very difficult to bridge back the commodity charts with the raw material impact on the revenue line, which is why we just break it out for you.

But the consumer behavioral shift required for reuse at scale is just not something we've seen anywhere in the world yet.

And then there's some areas that we would like to double-down on or that represent bigger opportunities for us, I mean, obviously, Flexibles in Asia. We have a business that's well over $1 billion in sales, but the market opportunity is enormous. So hopefully, we can supplement our growth there with M&A as one example.
Probably another one would be in the Rigid Packaging space outside of beverage. We've got a big business growing well organically, but can we supplement that with further M&A, we certainly hope so. So those would be a couple of examples. But there's bolt-on opportunities across the board, and we really hope to be active.
Look, on folding cartons, it's a business that's about 8% of sales in Amcor. It's the industry leader in what it does because it's a very specialized type of folding carton, high-graphic intensity and shapes and tactile features as well. So it's sort of at the high end. It's not cereal boxes per se. So it's a high-margin business that generates a lot of cash. And it's pretty core to our Flexibles perimeter because it's essentially a printing and converting business. And industrially, it looks exactly like our Flexibles businesses. In fact, some of the equipment is actually the same.
So it's every bit as core as everything else, and it's got a great financial profile. It's obviously got a different top line profile than the rest of the company. But from a return on capital and cash perspective, it's about as good as it gets."

And that will come back, there's no question about that.
And I think we're seeing signs of life in the developed markets, in particular, which were the hardest hit through COVID. So we operate that business globally. And in particular, it's big in Europe and North America as you would expect. And those are the areas where the COVID impacts, the reduced elective surgeries, the lower prescription rates, had a particular bite. So that's obviously -- I think we're coming out the other end of that. And hopefully, over the next couple of quarters, we start to see that normalize, and normalize in that sense means it's accretive to growth.

So that's really -- the headline message is that we're open for business if there's a great idea that somebody wants to help -- wants help developing or wants to come talk to us about.
ePac is a corporate venturing-type investment. It's a minority stake in a business that is essentially a startup. It's about a 4-year-old business. Fantastic business. It's really exciting. It's a flexible packaging business in essence. And it's gone really from 0 to about $100 million in sales in 4 years. It's got about 15 sites, most of them are in the U.S. I think there's a couple outside the U.S. And we're really excited to learn from it, quite frankly.
So the first objective is to learn and kind of leave it alone. And what we hope to learn is in a few areas. One is the commercial approach, which, as you point out, is geared towards smaller enterprises, and it leverages short runs, quick turnarounds and also high quality. So that's -- there's a commercial learning opportunity for Amcor. I think, industrially, the business is enabled by digital printing and some other kind of neat industrial aspects inside the 4 walls of a plant, which are also interesting to us.
And then the third thing, honestly, is how does the business grow from 0 to $100 million in 4 years. And I think there's a whole lot we can learn, like any big company, from a startup and how that happens, from a managerial and organizational perspective as well. So we're going to leave it alone a little bit, Adam, in the first instance, not a little bit, we're going to leave it alone. And we're going to watch and listen and learn. And then watch the space. I think you'll see different manifestations of those learnings benefit Amcor for many years to come."

Like the convention in the industry is that the raw material fluctuations are passed through to the marketplace. And so this is really -- the conversation about the lag or the P&L impact of changes in raw material prices is really about the commercial side of the business and the commercial capabilities of, first of all, measuring what those changes are and then executing price increases to recover those costs. So that's the absolute key point here.
And I think we have, I think, a pretty special approach to doing that, which goes all the way back, firstly, to understanding the profit of each order and each customer and each product. So I can talk more about that, but that's the commercial side.
On the procurement side, which I would treat as a slightly different dimension, I think our procurement capabilities have evolved over the years. I think as we've gotten bigger, we've added people, we've added expertise, we've added IT systems. Our buy is broad. I think the fact that we're now a bigger buyer in the U.S. gives us visibility into the dynamics in this market, that maybe we always had in Europe and didn't have as well in the U.S. As regional as the market can be at times, it absolutely has elements of a global market as well.

We probably would be at a higher level than 10% had it not been for some of the disruptions in the supply chain from the pandemic.
And it's also pretty exciting that many of the new SKUs that we launched, and we've got a lot of new product examples scattered throughout our materials today, many of them are made with 100% PCR. And it's almost like electronic vehicles to some extent. We're not launching a lot of new products in PET that aren't leveraging PCR to some extent, and many of them are 100% PCR.

On the investments in the recycling part of the value chain, look, never say never. We prefer not to put big [ looks of ] capital into parts of the value chain that are not necessarily areas we can be differentiated and unique in. We would prefer to be a demand catalyst and a source of demand for others who might put their capital in those spaces because it's more aligned with what they do.

That's a good example of leveraging a structure from the U.S. legacy Bemis business into ANZ. We've got some examples going the other way, from our New Zealand dairy film business, going to the U.S. market.
So I think you'll see more and more of that. It's a really interesting and complementary mix of segment participation that the businesses have had historically. If I look in North America, the big positions in protein and hard cheese, processed cheese that we acquired are absolutely additive for our portfolio in Europe. And then the pet food and coffee positions that we've had, in Europe, historically, are completely new and additive to the Bemis -- the legacy Bemis platform in North America.

Joining me today, as Tracey mentioned, is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with some prepared remarks and then we'll open the line for Q&A. 
We start every meeting at Amcor with safety and we'll begin there on Slide 3. Safety is the first and most important of our values and Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries. Our safety performance has shown continual improvement, including in the last 12 months, where our performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 25% compared to last year. All of our businesses reported fewer injuries, and over half of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. 
Through a year where the pandemic continued to present operational challenges in many countries, our focus on safety was unwavering, and we're incredibly grateful that our people continue to be engaged and focused on staying healthy as well as safe. We're proud of our safety performance, which we believe is the best in our industry and the progress we've made over a number of years, but we're also convinced that our objective of no injuries is absolutely possible and we continue striving towards that goal. 
We have 4 key messages today, which is set out on Slide 4. First, FY '21 was an outstanding year for Amcor on multiple dimensions. The operating environment remains highly dynamic, but our teams stayed fully focused on the key business drivers within our control, remained agile as conditions changed and demonstrated exceptional execution and consistency all year. Financial results exceeded our expectations as the year progressed. We ended the year with momentum and we expect another strong year in fiscal '22, which is the second key message. 
Third, our recent performance in many ways is a result of the financial and strategic benefits from our 2019 acquisition of Bemis. Two years on, the integration is now essentially complete, the financial benefits are ahead of our expectations, and strategically, we're better positioned than ever with a stronger foundation for growth into the future. And lastly, we're capitalizing on that strong base by investing in a number of organic growth initiatives, which will maintain our momentum beyond fiscal '22 and for the long term. 
Turning now to the financial highlights on Slide 5. FY '21 was an exceptional year financially for Amcor, with record earnings, exceptional margin management despite steep raw material cost increases and supply constraints and momentum building through the year. Organic sales growth was 2% and we exited the year in Q4 with sales 3% higher than the prior year. EBIT growth was 8% with the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments both delivering strong results, growing in several higher-value end markets and contributing to margin expansion. In fiscal '21, Amcor's EBIT margins increased 60 basis points to reach 12.6% for the year, which is a new high and an exceptional achievement in an environment where raw material price increases and supply disruptions continue to require an intense focus on securing availability as well as managing price recovery. 
We estimate Bemis acquisition synergies were around $75 million. And as we close out the final integration activities, we expect to exceed the original synergy target by at least 10%. EPS increased 16% for the year and was ahead of guidance, which we're able to continuously increase through the year. And free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the top of our expected range. Return on capital or return on average funds employed finished well above 15% at a time when our cost of capital is at an all-time low. And through the year, we returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. 
The key message here is that the fundamentals of our business continue to strengthen. Our teams around the world have demonstrated unwavering focus on executing against our strategy. And as a result, we've delivered another year of outstanding financial performance, with momentum continuing to build as we begin fiscal '22. I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some more detail on the financial results, and I'll finish up with some comments on growth and sustainability."
401715,1676082218,2380536,"Amcor plc, 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2021",2021-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Amcor plc","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as Ro",998,"Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as Ron mentioned earlier, these have continued to move higher during the quarter. Across the business, our response has been proactive and we have implemented price increases quickly. As a result, in the June quarter, net sales increased by more than $100 million, with the annual recovery run rate reaching more than $500 million as we exited the year. 
From an earnings perspective and consistent with last quarter, the price cost impact has remained manageable, given the diversity of materials we buy and the multiple regions in which we consume those materials. This is clearly evident in our margin performance, which continued expanding in Q4 and through the year. From a volume perspective, demand in many of our key high-value end markets has remained consistently strong including meat, coffee and pet food. However, this has been offset by double-digit declines in North America medical volumes and European pharmaceutical volumes, driven by fewer elective surgeries and lower prescription trends. 
From a geographic perspective, volume growth has been relatively broad-based with good overall performance in emerging markets. And while volumes in North America were higher than the prior year, along with Europe, this is where large parts of our health care business are located and growth in these regions is inclusive of those headwinds. 
Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, mainly reflecting volume growth, exceptional margin management with expansion delivered every quarter at around $65 million of cost synergy benefits related to the Bemis acquisition. 
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results, driven by an increasing consumer demand in both North and Latin America. Sales growth included a 5% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, annual beverage volumes were 8% higher than last year and hot fill container volumes were up 13%, driven by rising consumer demand through the year, which resulted in capacity shortages and historically low inventory levels across the industry. 
Demand was particularly strong in hot fill categories, including sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and juice. Year-to-date, specialty container volumes were higher than the prior period with growth in categories, including spirits, home and personal care, and this was partly offset by lower volumes in the health care segment. Volumes in Latin America were 5% higher than last year, with growth delivered in Brazil and Argentina, in particular. 
EBIT growth of 8% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business, and this was partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America. These higher costs have been a direct result of capacity shortages and low inventories throughout our network, which introduced supply chain inefficiencies in the short term ahead of installing additional capacity. 
Rigid containers continues to be one of the world's preferred packaging formats since it's recyclable, resealable and hygienic and has the lowest carbon footprint. As you'll see on the slide, this preference continues to be reflected over time with format share in a healthy growing market remaining consistent. Demand for recycled content is also rising rapidly, and our use of recycled resin has doubled over the last 2 years. Looking forward, we expect this trend to accelerate further and are working with customers on a very active pipeline of new product launches incorporating higher levels of recycled materials. 
Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the upper end of our expected range for the year and we finished the year strongly. Compared with last year, free cash flow benefited from the higher flow-through of higher earnings, and this was offset by a $100 million adverse impact from the timing of U.S. cash tax payments and a [indiscernible] working capital benefit. Working capital has been an area we have been particularly focused on through the Bemis integration and is a real highlight. In total, since 2019, approximately $250 million of working capital has been released, and this has been a source of funds to cover synergy-related cash costs. 
Capital expenditure increased in the current year as we have stepped up our organic investments in high-growth segments and geographies. Looking ahead, we have a broad range of attractive investment opportunities and expect to increase CapEx by a further 10% to 15% in fiscal 2022. Our financial profile is solid with leverage at 2.7x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis and is right in line with our expectations. With strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in organic growth, execute M&A as well as return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fiscal '21, total cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases reached an impressive $1.1 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9 and our outlook for the 2022 fiscal year. We expect comparable constant currency EPS growth of 7% to 11% for the full year. This excludes the effect of disposed businesses, which impact comparability, and an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.01 per share, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the remainder of the year. So on a reported basis, this results in an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share. 
Free cash flow is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, up to 10% higher than fiscal 2021, even as we are accelerating capital investments to support organic growth. Growing cash flow enables us to continue paying a compelling and growing dividend and allocate cash to share purchases, which we expect will be around $400 million in fiscal '22 while retaining the flexibility to fund acquisitive growth when needed. So with that, I'll hand back to Ron."

So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially comp",1245,"Thanks, Michael. I'll start with a few points to recap the Bemis acquisition on Slide 10. The all-stock acquisition of Bemis was completed in June 2019 and was the largest in Amcor's history. So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially complete, and the outcomes are clearly exceeding our original expectations. 
Firstly, from a financial perspective, the transaction unlocks substantial value through the realization of cost and cash flow synergies, which have materially strengthened Amcor's financial profile. More specifically, based on our fiscal '22 expectations over the 3-year period post closing the acquisition, we will have outperformed the original cost synergy target of $180 million by at least 10%, and as Michael mentioned, the cash released from working capital over the last 2 years funded the cash costs to achieve those synergies. 
Margins in our Flexibles segment will be more than 200 basis points higher than in fiscal 2019. EPS will be at least 35% higher or at least $0.21 per share. We will have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares issued to fund the acquisition. And the annual cash flow will be close to double Amcor's annual cash flow in the year prior to the acquisition. 
Strategically, Bemis was a perfect fit for Amcor. It was a pure play coming into what was already the world's largest global flexible packaging business. And putting these 2 companies together created the only truly global flexible packaging platform able to serve multinational customers around the world with an even stronger value proposition, especially in the most attractive end markets like health care and protein, where our participation has meaningfully increased. 
Amcor is now the clear flexible packaging leader in every major geography, with greater absolute and relative scale advantages. And we've strengthened our talent and capabilities, particularly in R&D, so we can support large and small customers with the broadest range of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions. Today, as a result of the Bemis acquisition, we're better positioned than ever with a strong foundation for growth looking forward. 
With that stronger foundation, we have a range of organic growth drivers that we're investing behind, and on Slide 11, we've highlighted a few. First, an increasing percentage of our sales are coming from the most attractive higher-growth, higher value-add segments where we have the best opportunities to differentiate, including health care and protein packaging and flexibles and the hot fill product segment in rigids. 
Our global health care business is approaching $2 billion in sales across medical device and pharmaceutical packaging, segments that require unique capabilities that are not easy to replicate. We're investing to add both capacity and capability with current projects underway in Malaysia and Ireland, to highlight 2 examples. 
In protein and meat packaging, we have a great opportunity to leverage our capabilities in high barrier films and our growing business in North America to the benefit of our other businesses around the world. In the hot fill rigid packaging segment, we have extensive intellectual property and product design capabilities, and we know how to partner with customers to help them drive growth through innovation. Given the sold-out environment we're in and the growth outlook, we're adding capacity across our North American plant network. 
Second organic growth driver we're highlighting today is our leading emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales and a long history of profitable growth. Again, we're investing behind the emerging market opportunity, including in the new greenfield plant in China that we highlighted on our last call. 
And third, innovation and new product development will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward. We've been investing in this area as well to extend our Global Innovation Center Network into Europe and China through the recently announced partnership with Michigan State University School of Packaging and with our entry into the corporate venturing space earlier this year. 
And finally, the #1 organic growth driver for Amcor going forward, which cuts across the other 3 and really everything else we do, will be the increasing need for more sustainable packaging. We know there will always be a role for packaging for essential food and health care products, and so the ability to provide that packaging so that it meets all consumer needs and is more sustainable creates a unique opportunity for growth. 
Slide 12 highlights sustainability a bit more. And as we take stock at the end of 1 financial year and start a new 1, we are particularly pleased with the progress we're making to accelerate responsible packaging through advances in package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Examples of recent progress on package design demonstrate the breadth of our product range across substrates with packaging that uses less material overall and more recycled content, eliminates problematic materials and has a better end-of-life profile. 
In terms of materials, our use of recycled resin in rigid packaging has almost doubled over the last 2 years, and we expect to almost double again over the next 12 to 18 months. We've also announced our new AmSky platform, which eliminates PVC and has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, in particular. To improve end-of-life outcomes, we've commercialized several new recycle-ready product platforms, including the polymer-based nLIGHT in AmPrima and the paper-based Matrix product ranges, and we've entered into a new partnership to extend our offering of compostable solutions. Demand is growing through these new products and we'll be scaling up to capture the growth opportunity. 
Making progress on waste management infrastructure and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across the value chain. We stepped up that collaboration over the past year through our partnership network, where Amcor has increasingly relied upon to safe and establish packaging design standards around the world, which can then inform infrastructure investment and consumer education to help keep packaging out of the environment. We'll talk more about our sustainability agenda following the publication of our annual sustainability report later this year. 
Slide 13 is a slide we shared late last year at our investor briefing but it remains relevant today. And we believe the Amcor investment case is as strong now as ever and we set out the reasons why on this slide. Several of the points have already been made, but in simple terms, we generated significant and growing free cash flow every year. In fiscal '22, that free cash flow will be up to $1.2 billion. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A and regular share repurchases, which in turn drive strong EPS growth. And in addition, we'll continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend. We also believe that momentum matters and momentum has been building in Amcor, which is clear from our recent performance and outlook comments and the expectations we have for our fiscal 2022 year. 
Finally, on Slide 14, a quick recap of our key messages from today. Amcor had an outstanding year in FY '21. We believe momentum is building and we expect another strong year in FY '22. The Bemis integration is essentially complete, and we've summarized the outcomes today, which have exceeded our expectations. And finally, we now look forward to capitalizing on a range of organic growth drivers, and we're investing in the business to make that happen. With that, operator, we'll conclude our opening remarks and we'd like to open the line for questions."

So the first thing is, as you know, standard in the industry, we pass through raw material pricing to customers and on a contractual basis, so it's a timing issue more than anything on that front. The other point about Amcor, obviously, we have a broad and diverse range of raw materials and consumption around the globe, so you've got to take that into account as you look at our numbers through the year. 
And then, of course, we build capabilities over the many years of getting that raw material passed through. So from where we sit today, we're really pleased with how we dealt with some of the spikes in '21. As we said in the remarks, we recovered over $100 million in Flexibles in Q4 alone and exited the year on an annualized basis, that was about $500 million in those prices, so more to come. 
The price lag cost was manageable as it was in Q3 so we haven't called that out specifically. And really the evidence around that is through our margins. So you can see that our margins continued to expand in Q4 and, in fact, expanded in every quarter throughout the year.

But there are certain materials, particularly some of the specialty grades that are ensured supply and that are on allocation.

So hot fill container is typically used in ready-to-drink teas or certain premium segments of the juice market, and of course, isotonics, sports drinks, and those categories collectively are all growing pretty rapidly.

And it pretty much is a combination of the drivers you mentioned, Kyle. There's, I think, increased distribution and availability in multipack formats. There's probably a bit more at-home consumption, but there's also a lot of new product launches and a lot of rejuvenation of legacy brands and also just extensions or introductions of new ones. So there's a lot happening in that space. A lot is oriented towards healthier and better-for-you type line extensions or new products. And so there's just a lot of activity there. 
And that's a segment where there really is only 1 packaging format. I mean, it's a PET set of segments that resealability, lightweight on-the-go consumption, it all kind of fits together with the value proposition of the plastic containers.

So Bemis brought scale, it brought further diversification in the spend. And that's -- I'm sure it helped. But I think the other thing, Andrew, and you've covered us for a long time, I think the experience curve, we continue to go down and we've kind of learned over the years.

Even after those 2 allocations of cash, the business will generate a substantial amount left over, and we go into the year with an expectation that we will have to, at least, buy back shares.

Just thinking on the M&A front, if you think about the kind of growth potential beyond fiscal '22, obviously, there's some more Bemis synergies that you you're capturing and annualizing as you roll into your fiscal '22 outlook. The size and scale of that Bemis opportunity was fairly unique and probably not going to be easy to replicate. And so I'm just trying to think about the ability or the confidence that you have to drive the inorganic growth and especially not just to buy the businesses but to extract value from them at scale moving forward, where it might be harder to find businesses of Bemis' size moving forward."

Look, it's a really good question at this point in time because we were absolutely resolute and focused on making the Bemis deal a success. And we  know there's a little bit to do but it's essentially complete, which is why we provided a bit of a wrap-up today. You're right. From a pure-play perspective, there's not another $6 billion or $7 billion deal out there that's obvious. And we don't feel compelled to move outside of our product segment mix because we just think there's ample growth in the segments that we're in. 
So if we kind of constrain things or put some boundaries around the opportunity set, that does not limit us in any way. I mean, generally speaking, if you go back over the last 10 years or so, the company has been pretty acquisitive. We're probably up to around 30 deals. And we've had a good track record of bringing synergies out on the cost side, in particular, getting some product benefits as well. So we'll continue to do that. 
I mean, I think there's no shortage of medium-sized deals in the packaging space. As you can see every week, there's another deal announced. And the good thing about being acquisitive and being big is that we're in the deal flow. So almost never a deal was happening that is at least not put in front of us, and we at least get the option to take a look or not. And that will be part of the formula going forward. So the $400 million that we're allocating this year to buybacks, I mean, we have an equal amount each year that we'd be thinking about deploying in an ongoing sense for bolt-on M&A. And then obviously, if something bigger comes up, then we would love to have a crack at that, too."

We've been a little bit lower than that because we've been focused on integrating Bemis, obviously, but we'll be at about 4%. That means another bit of a step-up next year, which is incorporated into the free cash flow guidance that Michael described. 
What anecdotally some of the places that we're deploying cash, I highlighted a few. We're putting some capacity in the hospital space in North America. Great use of capital, particularly when it's on-site, co-located within a customer premises. Those are as good as it gets in terms of organic investments. We're investing in the medical space, medical device packaging in Malaysia and in Ireland. We've got some capacity we're going to put in Malaysia for a certain product category that we typically export out of North America or Europe, and we're going to localize that, which opens up just a whole another set of growth options for us. And in Ireland, we're going to get into a product line in medical that we hadn't been in before. 
And then from a sustainability perspective, we made a number of announcements over the last 6 to 12 months in new products. So we've talked about a couple of platforms like AmLite, which is a recyclable or ready-to-be-recycled retort pouch, which is unique. And the demand has just been outstanding. The product is sold out before it's even barely been launched, and so we're going to add capacity in Europe for that. So those are just some examples, but that all fits within that roughly 4% of sales number that's embedded in our free cash flow guidance."

We also are humble enough to realize we don't have all the good ideas out there. And so if there's an acquisition that would add to our product portfolio, we would absolutely do it. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to be much more active in the corporate venturing space. 
It's another -- it's also one of the drivers of the investment with Michigan State. So we're going to do much more in terms of external sourcing of, let's call it, good ideas and innovation to supplement what we do believe is industry-leading R&D, so that I'd say watch this space. As far as the sales into what we might describe as more sustainable packaging, if we think about it through the lens of what's recyclable, we'll just take that lens and we're not, for a second, suggesting that, that's the only answer here but that tends to be the most readily available end-of-life solution. 
We've got 3 broad segments, 2 of which are fully recyclable. So pretty much everything that we produce and sell in Rigid Packaging is recyclable. Everything we make in the carton segment is recyclable. That leaves the Flexibles segment. And in that space, right now, of the sales in the Flexible Packaging segment, about 60-odd percent of what we're selling today is considered designed to be recycled. There's probably another 75% of our sales that could be, so there's 10% to 15% that could convert. It just requires customers to adopt a different structure. 
And then you have additional platforms like AmLite, AmLite Matrix and like AmPrima, which help move those numbers up in steps. None of them are going to move that needle on those metrics in a material way in a given year. But over time, the percentage of our Flexibles that is recyclable will start to increase as those products get take-up. I'll stop there, but we're also acknowledging that's not the end of the story. We've got to have the waste management infrastructure and the consumer has participated as well, too. But as far as the package design, that's about where we're at."

A lot of the material that we're using for food -- or for flexible packaging is coming from food-grade milk and water jugs and things and those are in scarce supply. That will change over time.

So pet food, coffee, protein, these are segments that we have really strong positions in but it's uneven. So we might be particularly strong in Europe in 1 and a little bit weaker in North America. And so evening out that participation is going to be a big source of organic growth. 
As a region as a whole, I would say Asia, particularly China and India, and I would probably elevate up from medical and just say generally in the places we're choosing to play in those Asian -- high-growth Asian emerging markets, that would make the list. 
And then I probably wouldn't rule out Rigid Packaging in North America, particularly as we continue to expand the health care -- or sorry, the hot fill franchise that we have and grow in the specialty container space, where there's technology and differentiation but also share opportunities. So it's a good question, Larry. I'd sort of give you those 3 as certainly amongst the top 4 or 5."

I look forward to scoping those out maybe in the near future. And my second question pertains to Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Excuse the criticism, but it feels like a bit of green-washing here. Amcor has taken this executive committee position. And when you get on the website for Alliance to End Plastic Waste, first of all, there's no set of accounts and it's supposed to be an organization that's well capitalized. 
But when you look at the projects, I think there was a project in India where they put some sort of filter in a river, which ended up getting stolen. There is a couple of projects, 1 in India and Africa, where it's highly manual-intensive, doesn't require a lot of capital of collecting waste. This is an organization that's backed by billions, and the projects seem very small. I'm just wondering where you want to take that organization because as you say, we need the waste management infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets. And I've always had hope that, that was going to be the organization that would drive it."

Joining me today, as Tracey mentioned, is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with some prepared remarks, and then we'll open the line for Q&A. 
We start every meeting at Amcor with safety and we'll begin there on Slide 3. Safety is the first and most important of our values and Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries. Our safety performance has shown continual improvement, including in the last 12 months, where our performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 25% compared to last year. All of our businesses reported fewer injuries. And over half of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. 
Through a year where the pandemic continued to present operational challenges in many countries, our focus on safety was unwavering, and we're incredibly grateful that our people continue to be engaged and focused on staying healthy as well as safe. We're proud of our safety performance, which we believe is the best in our industry and the progress we've made over a number of years, but we're also convinced that our objective of no injuries is absolutely possible and we continue striving towards that goal. 
We have 4 key messages today, which is set out on Slide 4. First, FY '21 was an outstanding year for Amcor on multiple dimensions. The operating environment remains highly dynamic, but our teams stayed fully focused on the key business drivers within our control, remained agile as conditions changed and demonstrated exceptional execution and consistency all year. Financial results exceeded our expectations as the year progressed. We ended the year with momentum and we expect another strong year in fiscal '22, which is the second key message. 
Third, our recent performance in many ways is a result of the financial and strategic benefits from our 2019 acquisition of Bemis. Two years on, the integration is now essentially complete, the financial benefits are ahead of our expectations, and strategically, we're better positioned than ever with a stronger foundation for growth into the future. And lastly, we're capitalizing on that strong base by investing in a number of organic growth initiatives, which will maintain our momentum beyond fiscal '22 and for the long term. 
Turning now to the financial highlights on Slide 5. FY '21 was an exceptional year financially for Amcor, with record earnings, exceptional margin management despite steep raw material cost increases and supply constraints and momentum building through the year. Organic sales growth was 2% and we exited the year in Q4 with sales 3% higher than the prior year. EBIT growth was 8% with the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments both delivering strong results, growing in several higher-value end markets and contributing to margin expansion. In fiscal '21, Amcor's EBIT margins increased 60 basis points to reach 12.6% for the year, which is a new high and an exceptional achievement in an environment where raw material price increases and supply disruptions continue to require an intense focus on securing availability as well as managing price recovery. 
We estimate -- Bemis acquisition synergies were around $75 million, and as we close out the final integration activities, we expect to exceed the original synergy target by at least 10%. EPS increased 16% for the year and was ahead of guidance, which we're able to continuously increase through the year. And free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the top of our expected range. Return on capital or return on average funds employed finished well above 15% at a time when our cost of capital is at an all-time low. And through the year, we returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. 
The key message here is that the fundamentals of our business continue to strengthen. Our teams around the world have demonstrated unwavering focus on executing against our strategy. And as a result, we've delivered another year of outstanding financial performance, with momentum continuing to build as we begin fiscal '22. 
I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some more detail on the financial results, and I'll finish up with some comments on growth and sustainability."
401715,1676082218,2380786,"Amcor plc, 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2021",2021-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Amcor plc","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as",998,"Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. 
I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as Ron mentioned earlier, these have continued to move higher during the quarter. Across the business, our response has been proactive and we have implemented price increases quickly. As a result, in the June quarter, net sales increased by more than $100 million, with the annual recovery run rate reaching more than $500 million as we exited the year. 
From an earnings perspective and consistent with last quarter, the price cost impact has remained manageable, given the diversity of materials we buy and the multiple regions in which we consume those materials. This is clearly evident in our margin performance, which continued expanding in Q4 and through the year. From a volume perspective, demand in many of our key high-value end markets has remained consistently strong including meat, coffee and pet food. However, this has been offset by double-digit declines in North America medical volumes and European pharmaceutical volumes, driven by fewer elective surgeries and lower prescription trends. 
From a geographic perspective, volume growth has been relatively broad-based with good overall performance in emerging markets. And while volumes in North America were higher than the prior year, along with Europe, this is where large parts of our health care business are located and growth in these regions is inclusive of those headwinds. 
Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, mainly reflecting volume growth, exceptional margin management with expansion delivered every quarter at around $65 million of cost synergy benefits related to the Bemis acquisition. 
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results, driven by an increasing consumer demand in both North and Latin America. Sales growth included a 5% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, annual beverage volumes were 8% higher than last year and hot fill container volumes were up 13%, driven by rising consumer demand through the year, which resulted in capacity shortages and historically low inventory levels across the industry. 
Demand was particularly strong in hot fill categories, including sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and juice. Year-to-date, specialty container volumes were higher than the prior period with growth in categories, including spirits, home and personal care, and this was partly offset by lower volumes in the health care segment. Volumes in Latin America were 5% higher than last year, with growth delivered in Brazil and Argentina, in particular. 
EBIT growth of 8% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business, and this was partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America. These higher costs have been a direct result of capacity shortages and low inventories throughout our network, which introduced supply chain inefficiencies in the short term ahead of installing additional capacity. 
Rigid containers continues to be one of the world's preferred packaging formats since it's recyclable, resealable and hygienic and has the lowest carbon footprint. As you'll see on the slide, this preference continues to be reflected over time with format share in a healthy growing market remaining consistent. Demand for recycled content is also rising rapidly, and our use of recycled resin has doubled over the last 2 years. Looking forward, we expect this trend to accelerate further and are working with customers on a very active pipeline of new product launches incorporating higher levels of recycled materials. 
Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the upper end of our expected range for the year and we finished the year strongly. Compared with last year, free cash flow benefited from the higher flow-through of higher earnings, and this was offset by a $100 million adverse impact from the timing of U.S. cash tax payments and a lower working capital benefit. Working capital has been an area we have been particularly focused on through the Bemis integration and is a real highlight. In total, since 2019, approximately $250 million of working capital has been released, and this has been a source of funds to cover synergy-related cash costs. 
Capital expenditure increased in the current year as we have stepped up our organic investments in high-growth segments and geographies. Looking ahead, we have a broad range of attractive investment opportunities and expect to increase CapEx by a further 10% to 15% in fiscal 2022. Our financial profile is solid with leverage at 2.7x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis and is right in line with our expectations. 
With strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in organic growth, execute M&A as well as return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fiscal '21, total cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases reached an impressive $1.1 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9 and our outlook for the 2022 fiscal year. We expect comparable constant currency EPS growth of 7% to 11% for the full year. This excludes the effect of disposed businesses, which impact comparability, and an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.01 per share, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the remainder of the year. So on a reported basis, this results in an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share. 
Free cash flow is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, up to 10% higher than fiscal 2021, even as we are accelerating capital investments to support organic growth. Growing cash flow enables us to continue paying a compelling and growing dividend and allocate cash to share purchases, which we expect will be around $400 million in fiscal '22 while retaining the flexibility to fund acquisitive growth when needed. 
So with that, I'll hand back to Ron."

So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially co",1245,"Thanks, Michael. 
I'll start with a few points to recap the Bemis acquisition on Slide 10. The all-stock acquisition of Bemis was completed in June 2019 and was the largest in Amcor's history. So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially complete, and the outcomes are clearly exceeding our original expectations. 
Firstly, from a financial perspective, the transaction unlocks substantial value through the realization of cost and cash flow synergies, which have materially strengthened Amcor's financial profile. More specifically, based on our fiscal '22 expectations over the 3-year period post closing the acquisition, we will have outperformed the original cost synergy target of $180 million by at least 10%, and as Michael mentioned, the cash released from working capital over the last 2 years funded the cash costs to achieve those synergies. 
Margins in our Flexibles segment will be more than 200 basis points higher than in fiscal 2019. EPS will be at least 35% higher or at least $0.21 per share. We will have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares issued to fund the acquisition. And the annual cash flow will be close to double Amcor's annual cash flow in the year prior to the acquisition. 
Strategically, Bemis was a perfect fit for Amcor. It was a pure play coming into what was already the world's largest global flexible packaging business. And putting these 2 companies together created the only truly global flexible packaging platform able to serve multinational customers around the world with an even stronger value proposition, especially in the most attractive end markets, like health care and protein, where our participation has meaningfully increased. 
Amcor is now the clear flexible packaging leader in every major geography, with greater absolute and relative scale advantages. And we've strengthened our talent and capabilities, particularly in R&D, so we can support large and small customers with the broadest range of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions. Today, as a result of the Bemis acquisition, we're better positioned than ever with a strong foundation for growth looking forward. 
With that stronger foundation, we have a range of organic growth drivers that we're investing behind, and on Slide 11, we've highlighted a few. First, an increasing percentage of our sales are coming from the most attractive higher-growth, higher value-add segments where we have the best opportunities to differentiate, including health care and protein packaging and flexibles and the hot fill product segment in rigids. 
Our global health care business is approaching $2 billion in sales across medical device and pharmaceutical packaging, segments that require unique capabilities that are not easy to replicate. We're investing to add both capacity and capability with current projects underway in Malaysia and Ireland, to highlight 2 examples. 
In protein and meat packaging, we have a great opportunity to leverage our capabilities in high barrier films and our growing business in North America to the benefit of our other businesses around the world. In the hot fill rigid packaging segment, we have extensive intellectual property and product design capabilities, and we know how to partner with customers to help them drive growth through innovation. Given the sold-out environment we're in and the growth outlook, we're adding capacity across our North American plant network. 
Second organic growth driver we're highlighting today is our leading emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales and a long history of profitable growth. Again, we're investing behind the emerging market opportunity, including in the new greenfield plant in China that we highlighted on our last call. 
And third, innovation and new product development will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward. We've been investing in this area as well to extend our Global Innovation Center Network into Europe and China through the recently announced partnership with Michigan State University School of Packaging and with our entry into the corporate venturing space earlier this year. 
And finally, the #1 organic growth driver for Amcor going forward, which cuts across the other 3 and really everything else we do, will be the increasing need for more sustainable packaging. We know there will always be a role for packaging for essential food and health care products, and so the ability to provide that packaging so that it meets all consumer needs and is more sustainable creates a unique opportunity for growth. 
Slide 12 highlights sustainability a bit more. And as we take stock at the end of 1 financial year and start a new 1, we are particularly pleased with the progress we're making to accelerate responsible packaging through advances in package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Examples of recent progress on package design demonstrate the breadth of our product range across substrates with packaging that uses less material overall and more recycled content, eliminates problematic materials and has a better end-of-life profile. 
In terms of materials, our use of recycled resin in rigid packaging has almost doubled over the last 2 years, and we expect to almost double again over the next 12 to 18 months. We've also announced our new AmSky platform, which eliminates PVC and has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, in particular. To improve end-of-life outcomes, we've commercialized several new recycle-ready product platforms, including the polymer-based nLIGHT in AmPrima and the paper-based Matrix product ranges, and we've entered into a new partnership to extend our offering of compostable solutions. Demand is growing through these new products and we'll be scaling up to capture the growth opportunity. 
Making progress on waste management infrastructure and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across the value chain. We stepped up that collaboration over the past year through our partnership network, where Amcor has increasingly relied upon to safe and establish packaging design standards around the world, which can then inform infrastructure investment and consumer education to help keep packaging out of the environment. We'll talk more about our sustainability agenda following the publication of our annual sustainability report later this year. 
Slide 13 is a slide we shared late last year at our investor briefing but it remains relevant today. And we believe the Amcor investment case is as strong now as ever and we set out the reasons why on this slide. Several of the points have already been made, but in simple terms, we generated significant and growing free cash flow every year. In fiscal '22, that free cash flow will be up to $1.2 billion. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A and regular share repurchases, which in turn drive strong EPS growth, and in addition, we'll continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend. We also believe that momentum matters and momentum has been building in Amcor, which is clear from our recent performance and outlook comments and the expectations we have for our fiscal 2022 year. 
Finally, on Slide 14, a quick recap of our key messages from today. Amcor had an outstanding year in FY '21. We believe momentum is building and we expect another strong year in FY '22. The Bemis integration is essentially complete, and we've summarized the outcomes today, which have exceeded our expectations. And finally, we now look forward to capitalizing on a range of organic growth drivers, and we're investing in the business to make that happen. 
With that, operator, we'll conclude our opening remarks and we'd like to open the line for questions."

And then, of course, we build capabilities over the many years of getting that raw material passed through. So from where we sit today, we're really pleased with how we dealt with some of the spikes in '21. As we said in the remarks, we recovered over $100 million in Flexibles in Q4 alone and exited the year on an annualized basis, that was about $500 million in those prices, so more to come. 
The price lag cost was manageable as it was in Q3 so we haven't called that out specifically. And really the evidence around that is through our margins.

There's probably a bit more at-home consumption, but there's also a lot of new product launches and a lot of rejuvenation of legacy brands and also just extensions or introductions of new ones. So there's a lot happening in that space. A lot is oriented towards healthier and better-for-you type line extensions or new products. And so there's just a lot of activity there. 
And that's a segment where there really is only one packaging format.

But I think the other thing, Andrew, and you've covered us for a long time, I think the experience curve, we continue to go down and we've kind of learned over the years. And I've been around long enough to have been through probably 3 of these peaks in the last 10 years. And I think with every cyclical peak, like the one we've been going through, we get better and better in terms of the internal processes and capabilities to, first of all, measure what's happening and then take action and mitigate it. So it's probably a combination of Bemis and maybe just getting further down the experience curve that's kind of helped us through the cycle."

Even after those 2 allocations of cash, the business will generate a substantial amount left over, and we go into the year with an expectation that we will have to, at least, buy back shares.

Just thinking on the M&A front, if you think about the kind of growth potential beyond fiscal '22, obviously, there's some more Bemis synergies that you you're capturing and annualizing as you roll into your fiscal '22 outlook. The size and scale of that Bemis opportunity was fairly unique and probably not going to be easy to replicate. 
And so I'm just trying to think about the ability or the confidence that you have to drive the inorganic growth and especially not just to buy the businesses but to extract value from them at scale moving forward, where it might be harder to find businesses of Bemis' size moving forward."

Look, it's a really good question at this point in time because we were absolutely resolute and focused on making the Bemis deal a success. And we  know there's a little bit to do but it's essentially complete, which is why we provided a bit of a wrap-up today. You're right. From a pure-play perspective, there's not another $6 billion or $7 billion deal out there that's obvious. And we don't feel compelled to move outside of our product segment mix because we just think there's ample growth in the segments that we're in. So if we kind of constrain things or put some boundaries around the opportunity set, that does not limit us in any way. 
I mean, generally speaking, if you go back over the last 10 years or so, the company has been pretty acquisitive. We're probably up to around 30 deals. And we've had a good track record of bringing synergies out on the cost side, in particular, getting some product benefits as well. So we'll continue to do that. I mean, I think there's no shortage of medium-sized deals in the packaging space. As you can see every week, there's another deal announced. And the good thing about being acquisitive and being big is that we're in the deal flow. So almost never a deal was happening that is at least not put in front of us, and we at least get the option to take a look or not. And that will be part of the formula going forward. 
So the $400 million that we're allocating this year to buybacks, I mean, we have an equal amount each year that we'd be thinking about deploying in an ongoing sense for bolt-on M&A. And then obviously, if something bigger comes up, then we would love to have a crack at that, too."

We've been a little bit lower than that because we've been focused on integrating Bemis, obviously, but we'll be at about 4%. That means another bit of a step-up next year, which is incorporated into the free cash flow guidance that Michael described. 
What anecdotally some of the places that we're deploying cash, I highlighted a few. We're putting some capacity in the hospital space in North America. Great use of capital, particularly when it's on-site, co-located within a customer premises. Those are as good as it gets in terms of organic investments. We're investing in the medical space, medical device packaging in Malaysia and in Ireland. We've got some capacity we're going to put in Malaysia for a certain product category that we typically export out of North America or Europe, and we're going to localize that, which opens up just a whole another set of growth options for us. And in Ireland, we're going to get into a product line in medical that we hadn't been in before. 
And then from a sustainability perspective, we made a number of announcements over the last 6 to 12 months in new products. So we've talked about a couple of platforms like AmLite, which is a recyclable or ready-to-be-recycled retort pouch, which is unique. And the demand has just been outstanding. The product is sold out before it's even barely been launched, and so we're going to add capacity in Europe for that. So those are just some examples, but that all fits within that roughly 4% of sales number that's embedded in our free cash flow guidance."

We also are humble enough to realize we don't have all the good ideas out there. And so if there's an acquisition that would add to our product portfolio, we would absolutely do it. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to be much more active in the corporate venturing space. It's another -- it's also one of the drivers of the investment with Michigan State. So we're going to do much more in terms of external sourcing of, let's call it, good ideas and innovation to supplement what we do believe is industry-leading R&D, so that I'd say watch this space. 
As far as the sales into what we might describe as more sustainable packaging, if we think about it through the lens of what's recyclable, we'll just take that lens and we're not, for a second, suggesting that, that's the only answer here but that tends to be the most readily available end-of-life solution. We've got 3 broad segments, 2 of which are fully recyclable. So pretty much everything that we produce and sell in Rigid Packaging is recyclable. Everything we make in the carton segment is recyclable. 
That leaves the Flexibles segment. And in that space, right now, of the sales in the Flexible Packaging segment, about 60-odd percent of what we're selling today is considered designed to be recycled. There's probably another 75% of our sales that could be, so there's 10% to 15% that could convert. It just requires customers to adopt a different structure. And then you have additional platforms like AmLite, AmLite Matrix and like AmPrima, which help move those numbers up in steps. None of them are going to move that needle on those metrics in a material way in a given year, but over time, the percentage of our Flexibles that is recyclable will start to increase as those products get take-up. 
I'll stop there, but we're also acknowledging that's not the end of the story. We've got to have the waste management infrastructure and the consumer has participated as well, too. But as far as the package design, that's about where we're at."

But in the cash flow that we saw at the year-end, we were pretty pleased with where we ended. It was a strong performance and we had a good finish in the year.

And so we've been actively sourcing both from new entrants into the recycled resin space as well as some of the virgin resin providers that have gotten into PCR. So it's a pretty broad book that we're buying across. 
And then in Flexibles, it is a little bit more challenging when you're trying to source polyolefins. And that's still pretty nascent. A lot of the material that we're using for food -- or for flexible packaging is coming from food-grade milk and water jugs and things and those are in scarce supply. That will change over time.

I'm going to elevate up on the top 3. But on the medical point in Asia, specifically, absolutely. I mean, we're actually doing that now and that's the investment in Malaysia that I referred to. We're putting capacity in that part of the world that enables us to be much more nimble and responsive to the local market demand, which is substantial. So that absolutely is part of it. 
I mean, if I zoom out and I try to think thematically, 1 thing that comes to mind is broadening our participation in some of the higher value-add segments that we're deep in, in one region. So pet food, coffee, protein, these are segments that we have really strong positions in but it's uneven. So we might be particularly strong in Europe in one and a little bit weaker in North America. And so evening out that participation is going to be a big source of organic growth. As a region as a whole, I would say Asia, particularly China and India, and I would probably elevate up from medical and just say generally in the places we're choosing to play in those Asian -- high-growth Asian emerging markets, that would make the list. 
And then I probably wouldn't rule out Rigid Packaging in North America, particularly as we continue to expand the health care -- or sorry, the hot fill franchise that we have and grow in the specialty container space, where there's technology and differentiation but also share opportunities. So it's a good question, Larry. I'd sort of give you those 3 as certainly amongst the top 4 or 5 spaces."

I look forward to scoping those out maybe in the near future. And my second question pertains to Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Excuse the criticism, but it feels like a bit of green-washing here. Amcor has taken this executive committee position. And when you get on the website for Alliance to End Plastic Waste, first of all, there's no set of accounts and it's supposed to be an organization that's well capitalized. 
But when you look at the projects, I think there was a project in India where they put some sort of filter in a river, which ended up getting stolen. There is a couple of projects, one in India and Africa, where it's highly manual-intensive, doesn't require a lot of capital of collecting waste. This is an organization that's backed by billions, and the projects seem very small. I'm just wondering where you want to take that organization because as you say, we need the waste management infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets. And I've always had hope that, that was going to be the organization that would drive it."

As far as waste management infrastructure, there's a number of different things and meetings to fund that, including extended producer responsibility regimes, bottle deposits and things like that.

Joining me today, as Tracey mentioned, is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with some prepared remarks, and then we'll open the line for Q&A. 
We start every meeting at Amcor with safety and we'll begin there on Slide 3. Safety is the first and most important of our values and Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries. Our safety performance has shown continual improvement, including in the last 12 months, where our performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 25% compared to last year. All of our businesses reported fewer injuries. And over half of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. 
Through a year where the pandemic continued to present operational challenges in many countries, our focus on safety was unwavering, and we're incredibly grateful that our people continue to be engaged and focused on staying healthy as well as safe. We're proud of our safety performance, which we believe is the best in our industry and the progress we've made over a number of years, but we're also convinced that our objective of no injuries is absolutely possible and we continue striving towards that goal. 
We have 4 key messages today, which is set out on Slide 4. First, FY '21 was an outstanding year for Amcor on multiple dimensions. The operating environment remains highly dynamic, but our teams stayed fully focused on the key business drivers within our control, remained agile as conditions changed and demonstrated exceptional execution and consistency all year. Financial results exceeded our expectations as the year progressed. We ended the year with momentum and we expect another strong year in fiscal '22, which is the second key message. 
Third, our recent performance in many ways is a result of the financial and strategic benefits from our 2019 acquisition of Bemis. Two years on, the integration is now essentially complete, the financial benefits are ahead of our expectations, and strategically, we're better positioned than ever with a stronger foundation for growth into the future. And lastly, we're capitalizing on that strong base by investing in a number of organic growth initiatives, which will maintain our momentum beyond fiscal '22 and for the long term. 
Turning now to the financial highlights on Slide 5. FY '21 was an exceptional year financially for Amcor, with record earnings, exceptional margin management despite steep raw material cost increases and supply constraints and momentum building through the year. Organic sales growth was 2% and we exited the year in Q4 with sales 3% higher than the prior year. EBIT growth was 8% with the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments both delivering strong results, growing in several higher-value end markets and contributing to margin expansion. In fiscal '21, Amcor's EBIT margins increased 60 basis points to reach 12.6% for the year, which is a new high and an exceptional achievement in an environment where raw material price increases and supply disruptions continue to require an intense focus on securing availability as well as managing price recovery. 
We estimate -- Bemis acquisition synergies were around $75 million, and as we close out the final integration activities, we expect to exceed the original synergy target by at least 10%. EPS increased 16% for the year and was ahead of guidance, which we're able to continuously increase through the year. And free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the top of our expected range. Return on capital or return on average funds employed finished well above 15% at a time when our cost of capital is at an all-time low. And through the year, we returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. 
The key message here is that the fundamentals of our business continue to strengthen. Our teams around the world have demonstrated unwavering focus on executing against our strategy. And as a result, we've delivered another year of outstanding financial performance, with momentum continuing to build as we begin fiscal '22. 
I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some more detail on the financial results, and I'll finish up with some comments on growth and sustainability."
401715,1676082218,2390686,"Amcor plc, 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2021",2021-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Amcor plc","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as",999,"Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. 
I'll start with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6, which performed very well, delivering record sales, EBIT and EBIT margins for the year. Sales includes recovery of higher raw material costs, and as Ron mentioned earlier, these have continued to move higher during the quarter. Across the business, our response has been proactive and we have implemented price increases quickly. As a result, in the June quarter, net sales increased by more than $100 million, with the annual recovery run rate reaching more than $500 million as we exited the year. 
From an earnings perspective and consistent with last quarter, the price cost impact has remained manageable, given the diversity of materials we buy and the multiple regions in which we consume those materials. This is clearly evident in our margin performance, which continued expanding in Q4 and through the year. From a volume perspective, demand in many of our key high-value end markets has remained consistently strong including meat, coffee and pet food. However, this has been offset by double-digit declines in North America medical volumes and European pharmaceutical volumes, driven by fewer elective surgeries and lower prescription trends. 
From a geographic perspective, volume growth has been relatively broad-based with good overall performance in emerging markets. And while volumes in North America were higher than the prior year, along with Europe, this is where large parts of our health care business are located and growth in these regions is inclusive of those headwinds. 
Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, mainly reflecting volume growth, exceptional margin management with expansion delivered every quarter at around $65 million of cost synergy benefits related to the Bemis acquisition. 
Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results, driven by an increasing consumer demand in both North and Latin America. Sales growth included a 5% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, annual beverage volumes were 8% higher than last year and hot fill container volumes were up 13%, driven by rising consumer demand through the year, which resulted in capacity shortages and historically low inventory levels across the industry. 
Demand was particularly strong in hot fill categories, including sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and juice. Year-to-date, specialty container volumes were higher than the prior period with growth in categories, including spirits, home and personal care, and this was partly offset by lower volumes in the health care segment. Volumes in Latin America were 5% higher than last year, with growth delivered in Brazil and Argentina, in particular. 
EBIT growth of 8% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business, and this was partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America. These higher costs have been a direct result of capacity shortages and low inventories throughout our network, which introduced supply chain inefficiencies in the short term ahead of installing additional capacity. 
Rigid containers continues to be one of the world's preferred packaging formats since it's recyclable, resealable and hygienic and has the lowest carbon footprint. As you'll see on the slide, this preference continues to be reflected over time with format share in a healthy growing market remaining consistent. Demand for recycled content is also rising rapidly, and our use of recycled resin has doubled over the last 2 years. Looking forward, we expect this trend to accelerate further and are working with customers on a very active pipeline of new product launches incorporating higher levels of recycled materials. 
Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the upper end of our expected range for the year and we finished the year strongly. Compared with last year, free cash flow benefited from the higher flow-through of higher earnings, and this was offset by a $100 million adverse impact from the timing of U.S. cash tax payments and a lower working capital benefit. Working capital has been an area we have been particularly focused on through the Bemis integration and is a real highlight. In total, since 2019, approximately $250 million of working capital has been released, and this has been a source of funds to cover synergy-related cash costs. 
Capital expenditure increased in the current year as we have stepped up our organic investments in high-growth segments and geographies. Looking ahead, we have a broad range of attractive investment opportunities and expect to increase CapEx by a further 10% to 15% in fiscal 2022. Our financial profile is solid with leverage at 2.7x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis and is right in line with our expectations. 
With strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in organic growth, execute M&A as well as return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fiscal '21, total cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases reached an impressive $1.1 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9 and our outlook for the 2022 fiscal year. We expect comparable constant currency EPS growth of 7% to 11% for the full year. This excludes the effect of disposed businesses, which impact comparability, and an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.01 per share, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the remainder of the year. So on a reported basis, this results in an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share. 
Free cash flow is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, up to 10% higher than fiscal 2021, even as we are accelerating capital investments to support organic growth. Growing cash flow enables us to continue paying a compelling and growing dividend and allocate cash to share purchases, which we expect will be around $400 million in fiscal '22 while retaining the flexibility to fund acquisitive growth when needed. 
So with that, I'll hand it back to Ron."

So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially co",1244,"Thanks, Michael. 
I'll start with a few points to recap the Bemis acquisition on Slide 10. The all-stock acquisition of Bemis was completed in June 2019 and was the largest in Amcor's history. So 2 years in now, our integration efforts are essentially complete, and the outcomes are clearly exceeding our original expectations. 
Firstly, from a financial perspective, the transaction unlocks substantial value through the realization of cost and cash flow synergies, which have materially strengthened Amcor's financial profile. More specifically, based on our fiscal '22 expectations over the 3-year period post-closing the acquisition, we will have outperformed the original cost synergy target of $180 million by at least 10%, and as Michael mentioned, the cash released from working capital over the last 2 years funded the cash costs to achieve those synergies. 
Margins in our Flexibles segment will be more than 200 basis points higher than in fiscal 2019. EPS will be at least 35% higher or at least $0.21 per share. We will have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares issued to fund the acquisition. And the annual cash flow will be close to double Amcor's annual cash flow in the year prior to the acquisition. 
Strategically, Bemis was a perfect fit for Amcor. It was a pure play coming into what was already the world's largest global flexible packaging business. And putting these 2 companies together created the only truly global flexible packaging platform able to serve multinational customers around the world with an even stronger value proposition, especially in the most attractive end markets, like health care and protein, where our participation has meaningfully increased. 
Amcor is now the clear flexible packaging leader in every major geography, with greater absolute and relative scale advantages. And we've strengthened our talent and capabilities, particularly in R&D, so we can support large and small customers with the broadest range of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions. Today, as a result of the Bemis acquisition, we're better positioned than ever with a strong foundation for growth looking forward. 
With that stronger foundation, we have a range of organic growth drivers that we're investing behind, and on Slide 11, we've highlighted a few. First, an increasing percentage of our sales are coming from the most attractive higher-growth, higher value-add segments where we have the best opportunities to differentiate, including health care and protein packaging and flexibles and the hot fill product segment in rigids. 
Our global health care business is approaching $2 billion in sales across medical device and pharmaceutical packaging, segments that require unique capabilities that are not easy to replicate. We're investing to add both capacity and capability with current projects underway in Malaysia and Ireland, to highlight 2 examples. 
In protein and meat packaging, we have a great opportunity to leverage our capabilities in high barrier films and our growing business in North America to the benefit of our other businesses around the world. In the hot fill rigid packaging segment, we have extensive intellectual property and product design capabilities, and we know how to partner with customers to help them drive growth through innovation. Given the sold-out environment we're in and the growth outlook, we're adding capacity across our North American plant network. 
Second organic growth driver we're highlighting today is our leading emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales and a long history of profitable growth. Again, we're investing behind the emerging market opportunity, including in the new greenfield plant in China that we highlighted on our last call. 
And third, innovation and new product development will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward. We've been investing in this area as well to extend our Global Innovation Center Network into Europe and China through the recently announced partnership with Michigan State University School of Packaging and with our entry into the corporate venturing space earlier this year. 
And finally, the #1 organic growth driver for Amcor going forward, which cuts across the other 3 and really everything else we do, will be the increasing need for more sustainable packaging. We know there will always be a role for packaging for essential food and health care products, and so the ability to provide that packaging so that it meets all consumer needs and is more sustainable creates a unique opportunity for growth. 
Slide 12 highlights sustainability a bit more. And as we take stock at the end of 1 financial year and start a new 1, we are particularly pleased with the progress we're making to accelerate responsible packaging through advances in package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Examples of recent progress on package design demonstrate the breadth of our product range across substrates with packaging that uses less material overall and more recycled content, eliminates problematic materials and has a better end-of-life profile. 
In terms of materials, our use of recycled resin in rigid packaging has almost doubled over the last 2 years, and we expect to almost double again over the next 12 to 18 months. We've also announced our new AmSky platform, which eliminates PVC and has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, in particular. To improve end-of-life outcomes, we've commercialized several new recycle-ready product platforms, including the polymer-based AmLite and AmPrima and the paper-based Matrix product ranges, and we've entered into a new partnership to extend our offering of compostable solutions. Demand is growing for these new products and we'll be scaling up to capture the growth opportunity. 
Making progress on waste management infrastructure and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across the value chain. We stepped up that collaboration over the past year through our partnership network, where Amcor is increasingly relied upon to safe and establish packaging design standards around the world, which can then inform infrastructure investment and consumer education to help keep packaging out of the environment. We'll talk more about our sustainability agenda following the publication of our annual sustainability report later this year. 
Slide 13 is a slide we shared late last year at our investor briefing but it remains relevant today. And we believe the Amcor investment case is as strong now as ever and we set out the reasons why on this slide. Several of the points have already been made, but in simple terms, we generated significant and growing free cash flow every year. In fiscal '22, that free cash flow will be up to $1.2 billion. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A and regular share repurchases, which in turn drive strong EPS growth, and in addition, we'll continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend. We also believe that momentum matters and momentum has been building in Amcor, which is clear from our recent performance and outlook comments and the expectations we have for our fiscal 2022 year. 
Finally, on Slide 14, a quick recap of our key messages from today. Amcor had an outstanding year in FY '21. We believe momentum is building and we expect another strong year in FY '22. The Bemis integration is essentially complete, and we've summarized the outcomes today, which have exceeded our expectations. And finally, we now look forward to capitalizing on a range of organic growth drivers, and we're investing in the business to make that happen. 
With that, operator, we'll conclude our opening remarks and we'd like to open the line for questions."

And then, of course, we build capabilities over the many years of getting that raw material passed through. So from where we sit today, we're really pleased with how we dealt with some of the spikes in '21. As we said in the remarks, we recovered over $100 million in Flexibles in Q4 alone and exited the year on an annualized basis, that was about $500 million in those prices, so more to come. 
The price lag cost was manageable as it was in Q3 so we haven't called that out specifically. And really the evidence around that is through our margins.

So hot fill container is typically used in ready-to-drink teas or certain premium segments of the juice market, and of course, isotonics, sports drinks, and those categories collectively are all growing pretty rapidly.

There's probably a bit more at-home consumption, but there's also a lot of new product launches and a lot of rejuvenation of legacy brands and also just extensions or introductions of new ones. So there's a lot happening in that space. A lot is oriented towards healthier and better-for-you type line extensions or new products. And so there's just a lot of activity there. 
And that's a segment where there really is only one packaging format.

I mean, what Bemis would have brought is just greater diversification in the buy. So we got bigger obviously but -- and that helps. The relationships we have with the big suppliers are not unlike the relationships we have with big multinational customers. It definitely matters to be big on a global basis. And there's a lot of discussion about these regional markets or global markets. I think ultimately, we have some big global relationships and it's helpful. 
So Bemis brought scale, it brought further diversification in the spend, and that's -- I'm sure it helped. But I think the other thing, Andrew, and you've covered us for a long time, I think the experience curve, we continue to go down and we've kind of learned over the years. And I've been around long enough to have been through probably 3 of these peaks in the last 10 years. And I think with every cyclical peak, like the one we've been going through, we get better and better in terms of the internal processes and capabilities to, first of all, measure what's happening and then take action and mitigate it. So it's probably a combination of Bemis and maybe just getting further down the experience curve that's kind of helped us through the cycle."

Even after those 2 allocations of cash, the business will generate a substantial amount left over, and we go into the year with an expectation that we will have to, at least, buy back shares.

Just thinking on the M&A front, if you think about the kind of growth potential beyond fiscal '22, obviously, there's some more Bemis synergies that you're capturing and annualizing as you roll into your fiscal '22 outlook. The size and scale of that Bemis opportunity was fairly unique and probably not going to be easy to replicate. 
And so I'm just trying to think about the ability or the confidence that you have to drive the inorganic growth and especially not just to buy the businesses but to extract value from them at scale moving forward, where it might be harder to find businesses of Bemis' size moving forward."

Look, it's a really good question at this point in time because we were absolutely resolute and focused on making the Bemis deal a success. And we know there's a little bit to do but it's essentially complete, which is why we provided a bit of a wrap-up today. You're right. From a pure-play perspective, there's not another $6 billion or $7 billion deal out there that's obvious. And we don't feel compelled to move outside of our product segment mix because we just think there's ample growth in the segments that we're in. So if we kind of constrain things or put some boundaries around the opportunity set, that does not limit us in any way. 
I mean, generally speaking, if you go back over the last 10 years or so, the company has been pretty acquisitive. We're probably up to around 30 deals. And we've had a good track record of bringing synergies out on the cost side, in particular, getting some product benefits as well. So we'll continue to do that. I mean, I think there's no shortage of medium-sized deals in the packaging space. As you can see every week, there's another deal announced. And the good thing about being acquisitive and being big is that we're in the deal flow. So almost never a deal was happening that is at least not put in front of us, and we at least get the option to take a look or not. And that will be part of the formula going forward. 
So the $400 million that we're allocating this year to buybacks, I mean, we have an equal amount each year that we'd be thinking about deploying in an ongoing sense for bolt-on M&A. And then obviously, if something bigger comes up, then we would love to have a crack at that, too."

No, it's a good question. I mean, we're going to be stepping up. We'll be about 4% of sales, which we think is a reasonable number to expect us to deploy each year. We've been a little bit lower than that because we've been focused on integrating Bemis, obviously, but we'll be at about 4%. That means another bit of a step-up next year, which is incorporated into the free cash flow guidance that Michael described. 
What anecdotally some of the places that we're deploying cash, I highlighted a few. We're putting some capacity in the hospital space in North America. Great use of capital, particularly when it's on-site, co-located within a customer premises. Those are as good as it gets in terms of organic investments. We're investing in the medical space, medical device packaging in Malaysia and in Ireland. We've got some capacity we're going to put in Malaysia for a certain product category that we typically export out of North America or Europe, and we're going to localize that, which opens up just a whole another set of growth options for us. And in Ireland, we're going to get into a product line in medical that we hadn't been in before. 
And then from a sustainability perspective, we made a number of announcements over the last 6 to 12 months in new products. So we've talked about a couple of platforms like AmLite, which is a recyclable or ready-to-be-recycled retort pouch, which is unique. And the demand has just been outstanding. The product is sold out before it's even barely been launched, and so we're going to add capacity in Europe for that. So those are just some examples, but that all fits within that roughly 4% of sales number that's embedded in our free cash flow guidance."

We also are humble enough to realize we don't have all the good ideas out there. And so if there's an acquisition that would add to our product portfolio, we would absolutely do it. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to be much more active in the corporate venturing space. It's another -- it's also one of the drivers of the investment with Michigan State. So we're going to do much more in terms of external sourcing of, let's call it, good ideas and innovation to supplement what we do believe is industry-leading R&D, so that I'd say watch this space. 
As far as the sales into what we might describe as more sustainable packaging, if we think about it through the lens of what's recyclable, we'll just take that lens and we're not, for a second, suggesting that, that's the only answer here but that tends to be the most readily available end-of-life solution. We've got 3 broad segments, 2 of which are fully recyclable. So pretty much everything that we produce and sell in Rigid Packaging is recyclable. Everything we make in the carton segment is recyclable. 
That leaves the Flexibles segment. And in that space, right now, of the sales in the Flexible Packaging segment, about 60-odd percent of what we're selling today is considered designed to be recycled. There's probably another 75% of our sales that could be, so there's 10% to 15% that could convert. It just requires customers to adopt a different structure. And then you have additional platforms like AmLite, AmLite Matrix and like AmPrima, which help move those numbers up in steps. None of them are going to move that needle on those metrics in a material way in a given year, but over time, the percentage of our Flexibles that is recyclable will start to increase as those products get take-up. 
I'll stop there, but we're also acknowledging that's not the end of the story. We've got to have the waste management infrastructure and the consumer has to participate as well, too. But as far as the package design, that's about where we're at."

But in the cash flow that we saw at the year end, we were pretty pleased with where we ended. It was a strong performance and we had a good finish in the year.

And that number is growing in absolute tons, as you referred to, but also it's growing as a percentage of the resin that we convert. In that space, we're clearly the biggest buyer out there. And so we've been actively sourcing both from new entrants into the recycled resin space as well as some of the virgin resin providers that have gotten into PCR. So it's a pretty broad book that we're buying across. 
And then in Flexibles, it is a little bit more challenging when you're trying to source polyolefins. And that's still pretty nascent. A lot of the material that we're using for food -- or for flexible packaging is coming from food-grade milk and water jugs and things and those are in scarce supply. That will change over time.

You might not look at it geography. You might look at it maybe pet food across the world. So can you dimensionalize those top 3 initiatives trying to look past short-term earnings?"

I mean, you picked on 1 -- I'm not sure it makes the top 3. I'm going to elevate up on the top 3. But on the medical point in Asia, specifically, absolutely. I mean, we're actually doing that now and that's the investment in Mal",292,"Yes. It's a good question. I mean, you picked on 1 -- I'm not sure it makes the top 3. I'm going to elevate up on the top 3. But on the medical point in Asia, specifically, absolutely. I mean, we're actually doing that now and that's the investment in Malaysia that I referred to. We're putting capacity in that part of the world that enables us to be much more nimble and responsive to the local market demand, which is substantial. So that absolutely is part of it. 
I mean, if I zoom out and I try to think thematically, one thing that comes to mind is broadening our participation in some of the higher value-add segments that we're deep in, in one region. So pet food, coffee, protein, these are segments that we have really strong positions in but it's uneven. So we might be particularly strong in Europe in one and a little bit weaker in North America. And so evening out that participation is going to be a big source of organic growth. As a region as a whole, I would say Asia, particularly China and India, and I would probably elevate up from medical and just say generally in the places we're choosing to play in those Asian -- high-growth Asian emerging markets, that would make the list. 
And then I probably wouldn't rule out Rigid Packaging in North America, particularly as we continue to expand the health care -- or sorry, the hot fill franchise that we have and grow in the specialty container space, where there's technology and differentiation but also shared opportunities. So it's a good question, Larry. I'd sort of give you those 3 as certainly amongst the top 4 or 5 spaces."

And when you get on the website for Alliance to End Plastic Waste, first of all, there's no set of accounts and it's supposed to be an organization that's well capitalized. 
But when you look at the projects, I think there was a project in India where they put some sort of filter in a river, which ended up getting stolen. There is a couple of projects, one in India and Africa, where it's highly manual-intensive, doesn't require a lot of capital of collecting waste. This is an organization that's backed by billions, and the projects seem very small. I'm just wondering where you want to take that organization because as you say, we need the waste management infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets.

Returns are always going to be important. The company is now generating a 15% return on capital, so we need to be there or thereabouts as we think about investments.

As far as waste management infrastructure, there's a number of different things and means to fund that, including extended producer responsibility regimes, bottle deposits and things like that.

Thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2022 first quarter results. Joining me today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. We star",634,"Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2022 first quarter results. Joining me today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. 
We start with safety because it's the first and most important of our values and the highest priority for every one of our 46,000 people around the world. And Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries, and our safety performance remains a real highlight. 
Across the group, we reduced the number of injuries by 16% compared to the prior year, and 62% of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. As we continue to make strong progress, it reinforces our conviction that an objective of no injuries is absolutely possible, and we continue striving towards that goal. 
We have 4 key messages today that sit here on Slide 4. First, Amcor is navigating well through challenging external conditions that we highlighted in August. And like the rest of our industry, including our customers and suppliers, we're experiencing unprecedented complexity across the supply chain, but we're performing well, and we remain on track to deliver on our expectations for the year. We're able to say that confidently because we're leveraging our scale and global reach, we are relying on the capabilities and experience of our management teams, and we're maintaining an unwavering focus on the right priorities, in particular, security of supply for our customers, recovery of higher input costs, and managing the sales mix. 
The second message today is that Amcor delivered a solid first quarter. While sales were tempered by supply chain challenges in some parts of the business, we delivered another solid quarter of double-digit earnings growth, which was in line with our expectations. 
Third, we're reaffirming fiscal '22 guidance, and we remain on track to meet the fiscal '22 earnings growth and cash flow objectives that we provided in August. 
And finally, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years, and today, Amcor is better positioned strategically than ever. In addition to delivering against short-term priorities, we remain focused on our long-term strategy and track record of growth and value creation. 
Turning to the financial highlights on Slide 5. The business delivered a solid start to the fiscal year. Our 10% reported net sales growth includes approximately $285 million of price increases related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. We're incredibly proud of the way our teams have continued to successfully steer us through this environment of ongoing inflation, achieving significant recovery over the last several quarters, and we'll continue to manage this dynamic going forward. 
Excluding this pass-through impact, organic sales grew 1%. In this environment, we're maintaining focus on our long-term strategy of optimizing mix, and it's clear that volume performance in both segments would have been higher in an unconstrained environment. Overall, EBIT increased 7% in comparable constant currency terms, which was right in line with expectations. The Flexibles segment had a strong quarter, generating earnings growth of 8%, driven by favorable mix and outstanding management of costs. 
In Rigid Packaging, the business in North America experienced a particularly challenging environment, including elevated demand, combined with full capacity utilization and constraints of critical inputs which resulted in operating inefficiencies and higher costs. 
Net income and EPS were both up at double-digit rates, increasing by 10% and 12%, respectively. And our financial profile remains strong. We increased cash returns to shareholders during the quarter, including repurchases of $64 million of shares, and the Board declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. So the key message here is that the business remains focused and continues to execute well. 
And with that, I'll hand over to Michael."
401715,1685597634,2422058,"Amcor plc, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Amcor plc","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. The Flexibles business performed very well during the period, delivering growth in high-value end markets, executing well to recover inflation and demonstrating strong cost performance. Reported sales grow",827,"Thanks, Ron. Hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. The Flexibles business performed very well during the period, delivering growth in high-value end markets, executing well to recover inflation and demonstrating strong cost performance. Reported sales growth of 10% includes recovery of higher raw material costs, which increased through the quarter. Actions we have taken to pass through those high costs drove sales up by approximately $210 million, which, on an annual basis, is well over $800 million and represented growth of 9% in the quarter compared with last year. The overall price/cost impact was unfavorable, but has remained manageable given the diversity of materials we'll buy, the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of inflation-driven pricing actions. This is once again evident in our margins, which remained at a level equal to the prior year despite the impact of higher raw material costs and related pricing recovery. 
Excluding this raw material impact, organic revenue growth of 1% was driven by favorable price/mix of approximately 2%. Consistent with our long-term strategy, the business has remained focused on mix with continued growth in higher-value end markets, including pet food, premium coffee and medical. This growth more than offset the sales impact of lower volumes in segments such as Home and Personal Care and across Southeast Asia. In addition, shortages of certain raw materials, including aluminum and specialty resins, had a dampening effect on volume performance in some categories, including health care and protein-related products. Adjusted EBIT was up 8% in constant currency terms for the quarter and reflects a favorable mix, strong productivity and cost improvements. 
Turning to the Rigid Packaging business on Slide 7. We delivered reported sales growth of 13%, reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Comparable constant currency sales growth of 1% was driven by higher overall volumes. In North America, beverage volumes were marginally ahead of the same period last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were 1% lower against a strong comparative period of double-digit growth, and higher demand in juice categories was offset by lower sports drinks volumes. Specialty container volumes were lower against the prior year, which benefited from strong volumes in the Home & Personal Care category. 
In Latin America, double-digit volume growth reflects strong performance in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, and earnings were higher in the region. In constant currency terms, segment earnings were adversely impacted by inefficiencies and higher costs in North America, resulting from unprecedented industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions. 
Overall demand remained elevated and increasingly volatile in the beverage segment. At the same time, the business continued to operate at full capacity and we put historically low levels of inventory. This, coupled with further inflation and shortages for key inputs, including PET and certain specialty resins, resulted in operating efficiencies and higher costs in order to service customer demand. While we expect these dynamics to persist in the second quarter, we anticipate current challenges will improve through the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 8. As a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year. And for the current quarter, adjusted free cash outflow of $242 million compares with an outflow of $190 million last year. The increased outflow mainly reflects higher uses of cash related to working capital with the adverse impact related to timing of higher raw material costs cycling through the business. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance. And our rolling 12-month average working capital to sales ratio at the end of September remains below 8%. 
As planned, capital expenditure is tracking higher than last year as we have stepped up organic investments in key high-growth segments and geographies. Amcor's financial profile remains solid with leverage at 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is in line with our expectations for this time of year. And cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter were higher than the prior year, which reflects $64 million of share repurchases mentioned earlier and an increase in dividend per share. 
Taking us to the outlook on Slide 9. A solid first quarter of double-digit EPS growth, in line with our expectations, enables us to reaffirm the 2022 guidance we outlined in August. We continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis, which represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year. 
Free cash flow is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and the growing cash flow enables us to continue to pay a compelling growing dividend and allocate cash to share repurchases, which we expect will be around $400 million in fiscal '22, while retaining the flexibility to fund acquisitive growth when needed. 
So with that, I'll hand back to Ron."

Over the last several years, we've continued to execute against o",842,"Okay. Thanks, Michael. Before closing and turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the longer term, starting on Slide 10, which summarizes the investment case for Amcor. 
Over the last several years, we've continued to execute against our strategy, strengthen our capabilities and establish a stronger foundation for growth and value creation. And as a result, we believe Amcor is better positioned strategically and our investment case is as strong as ever. 
In simple terms, that investment case starts with our market positions. We're the global leader in most of our chosen segments with relative and absolute scale advantages in every region and significant exposure to attractive high-value end markets across food, beverage and health care. We have a proven track record of consistent earnings growth and margin expansion, and we generate significant free cash flow every year, including between the $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in this 2022 fiscal year. With a strong balance sheet, that cash flow provides substantial capacity to invest in the long-term potential of our business and also to deliver a significant and growing amount of cash to shareholders. 
We use our shareholder value creation framework, which is shown here on Slide 11, to describe how we allocate cash flow every year and how that translates into value for shareholders. Through the combination of reinvestment in the base business, M&A and share repurchases, we expect to generate 5% to 10% constant currency EPS growth each year. Our dividend has historically yielded around 4% and continues to be especially compelling in such a low interest rate environment. But through economic and commodity cycle, the outcome of allocating capital in this way has resulted in average value creation through a combined EPS growth and dividend yield of about 13.5% each year, in line with the 10% to 15% you see here on this slide, and we're very well positioned to continue that trend. 
The strategic choices we've made guide how we prioritize investments back into the business, and we're investing now in several areas that will continue to drive long-term organic growth, and those are highlighted on Slide 12. First, our business mix is increasingly oriented towards the most attractive segments, which offer greater potential for differentiation and growth like health care, pet food, premium coffee and hot fill beverages. Our results this quarter provide strong evidence of how the considered choices we make every day lead to these attractive segments, representing an increasing percentage of our sales mix, which contributes to consistent margin expansion over time even while navigating complex environments like the one we're in now. 
Second, we continue to invest to expand our leading emerging market positions. We had another quarter of double-digit growth in both China and India, for example, and we're actively investing in these markets where we expect to see demand remain a tailwind for the foreseeable future. 
And third, we remain uniquely positioned to launch a steady stream of innovative new packaging solutions. We're investing in our innovation capabilities and network of global innovation centers so we can capitalize on what we believe is our greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation, and that is the demand for more sustainable packaging. 
Slide 13 highlights what we see as the 3 requirements for responsible packaging, and we're seeing clear progress on each of the 3: Package design; waste management infrastructure; and consumer participation. In the past, we've highlighted examples of groundbreaking new product platforms like AmLite, AmPrima and AmSky, but we're also actively collaborating with others to develop solutions that address infrastructure and consumer participation. Most of these initiatives start small, but all have the benefit of demonstrating working models that can be scaled and leveraged across markets and customers. In Colombia, as an example, we partnered with one of our key customers and others across the value chain to achieve a fully circular bottle-to-bottle solution for amber-colored beverage containers where the color is critical for this particular brand. In Australia, we've enabled an iconic brand to transition confectionery packaging to a structure which incorporates 30% chemically recycled material. And finally, an example which is already functioning at scale globally, we've worked with the global market leader for single-serve premium coffee to increase the use of recycled aluminum, which is now at 80% for our core product line. In the next few weeks, we'll be releasing our 2021 sustainability report, which will describe our sustainability strategy and agenda more fully, and we'll provide more data in case studies to illustrate the strong progress we've made over the last 12 months. 
And finally, on Slide 14, a summary for today. Amcor delivered a solid first quarter results in line with expectations as we navigated well through a challenging external environment. This leaves us on track to meet our 2022 fiscal year guidance. And looking further ahead, we're better positioned strategically than ever before with a strong foundation for continued growth and value creation. 
So with that, operator, we'll close our opening remarks and open the line for questions. Thanks."

So our guidance is just from August, and factors in pretty much the volume growth that you would expect from us in any given year. We're sort of low single digits, a little slower this first quarter, but predominantly because of some of the constraints we had in the supply chain, we would expect through the rest of the year, those will abate over time. 
And as it relates to the pricing, we haven't historically seen a lot of elasticity in the demand for the products that we're providing packaging for. Considering that these are defensive consumer staples on the food side, even the more premium products have been pretty resilient to price. There's been a lot of price taken already in many of those segments. And then obviously, on the health care side, it's probably even less so."

There are times when labor is hard to come by. That's definitely true. But more for us, it's been a supply situation on the raw material side that's been limiting. And it's predominantly been in some specialty resins that affect the Flexibles business and also the Specialty Container part of Rigid Plastics. These are resins that are not used in large quantities, but provide some particular feature, barrier or otherwise that have been on particularly short supply and have put us on allocation and we, in turn, have put customers in allocation in several segments across the business, including medical, where we had a rebound and had some growth, but not as much as we could have had. So specialty resins is 1 area. 
In PET, which is a predominant raw material in our Rigid Packaging business, we've been searching for resin for much of the quarter. In fact, probably back into the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year as a number of our suppliers have had disruptions of a variety of different sorts and have encountered force majeure. And then even for some of the aluminum grades that we use in pharmaceutical packaging, we've had limitations. And so again, we've had customers on allocation in the pharma space as well. So that's where we're seeing it. 
Now I think there's reasons to believe that there's relief in sight. Many of those specialty resins, we're starting to get some increased allocations. PET, over the next quarter or 2, should start to normalize as well. But certainly, in the first quarter, it provided a bit of a headwind."

And firstly, I would point out, this is a North American set of circumstances. The Latin American business has performed quite well with strong volume growth and higher earnings. 
In North America, we've got a unique set of circumstances. So firstly, the demand has remained elevated for quite some time, particularly in the beverage space. That has led to a depletion of inventories. We've been running with historically low inventories pretty much for the whole calendar year, and we're running flat out at pretty much full capacity utilization. On top of which then, we've had some supply disruptions, as I just alluded to on the PET side, which is the primary input. 
So all of those things have been firing at once have led to some inefficiencies and therefore, higher cost in the business. Now as we look forward, we see these conditions abating certainly through the second half. I think we're going to wear much of that continuing through Q2. But in the second half, we believe these will ease. 
And that's for a few reasons. Firstly, we've got more capacity coming on stream. And we've had capacity coming on through this calendar year as well, but it's been consumed through the year, but there's more coming on stream, as we've called out in previous calls. Secondly, we will start to build inventory now through the fiscal second quarter, the calendar fourth quarter that is -- tends to be the low season where inventories get built and we will be building through this quarter. And then thirdly, on the raw material side, some of the dislocations there are easing. So the allocation level that we are living with from a PET perspective are starting to increase, and some of the capacity upstream with the PET resin suppliers is starting to come back to more normal levels. So we do see reasons to be optimistic, particularly around the second half, but we're going to wear these conditions now for the next few months for sure."

And health care for us is, broadly speaking, medical device packaging, which you alluded to, and then pharmaceutical packaging as well. And both of those segments have been impacted through COVID and have had demand at much lower levels than we would historically see. We would typically see mid-single-digit growth each year in both of those segments. And it's -- these are 2 attractive segments, high margins, high levels of differentiation, lots of innovation. So they are about as good places you can play in flexible packaging. .
Medical has started to come back a bit. Demand conditions improved in the first quarter. We did see a bit of an uptick in some of the elective procedures that you referred to, which drive consumption of medical device packaging. So we saw some improvement through the quarter, but again, we were limited with some of the specialty resins that go into those products, and we ended up having to put some customers on allocation and not capturing the full rebound in demand. We would only anticipate demand to continue to build and get back to more normalized levels and some of the raw material challenges to ease, although we know we're not out of the woods yet on at least a couple of particular resins. 
On the pharmaceutical side, we've seen a very, very modest improvement in demand, not to the same extent as medical. And in particular, in that business in Europe, it's predominantly foil-based set of products. We've had some limitations on foil supply as well, which have held us back. But we would expect that over time, as COVID recedes a bit and people get back to normal, these normal behavioral patterns that pharmaceutical consumption will return back to the levels it was pre-pandemic as well. So we're pretty bullish on these 2 segments long term, and there's just some, I guess, another couple of rigs here as we get back to normal."

And as Ron mentioned in the earlier comments, the teams have been really focused not only on securing supply for us and making sure we've got as much as we can to service customers, but also getting that raw material recovery through the marketplace. And we were really pleased with where we got to in the quarter. You might recall at the end of Q4 last year, we had $100 million roughly flow through the sales line this quarter, all up around $280 million with $210 million of that in Flexibles. So pretty significant recovery. We did see some headwinds, particularly in Flexibles from that. So but it was manageable. And outside of that, you saw that in our margins, where, year-on-year, the Flexibles margins actually will maintain at 13%. So we were pretty pleased with that result because if you take the raw material recovery out of the mix, margins in effect would have been about 100 basis points higher, so closer to 14% without that raw material recovery pass-through. So we're pretty pleased with where we got to in the quarter. We'd expect that there's still further recovery to come, obviously. And in Q2, we are contemplating still some lag in that price cost recovery as we work through the next quarter. And -- but the indices are quite mixed. Some indices are suggesting that the raw materials are perhaps tailing off a little and have reached their peak, in other areas and certain geographies around the world still looking at some increases. So a little bit of a mixed position there as well, John. But that's all factored into our guidance range that we put out there for the full year."

So that's been a ongoing journey. We've got some capacity that's come on stream -- coming out stream this quarter and will continue in the next couple of quarters. 
As it relates to Flexibles, we have flagged a number of investments, including a new plant in China, which is midway through its construction. It's in the south of China, in the Guangdong province, which is going to add capacity for the health care business there as well as some of the other segments that we service in that area. We've been expanding and adding capacity on some of the sustainability platforms. There's more sustainable platforms that we've flagged. So we've talked about AmLite in the past and AmPrima. We're putting capital to work in both of those -- for both of those products as 2 examples.

If the customers are not running their plant, we are limited in how much material we can ship. I think that particularly in North America, labor has been an issue. There's a lot of theories as to why that is. But our customers and Amcor are doing ever we can to keep our plants fully staffed. Transport, at times, has been a constraint as well.

So on the corporate cost side, yes, there's definitely some phasing element in there. Also, in the prior year in Q1, we had and an insurance claim we had to provide for in Q1 last year, and that's really the key difference in the corporate costs. We'd expect by the half, the phasing there more normalizes to be more in line with the corporate costs position at the half last year. So that's kind of the impact on that front. And corporate costs generally in the first half is lighter than the second half just as we share our provisions and accruals and things like employee incentives and other they tend to happen in the second half as we progress through the year. So that's really the key difference there from the June quarter. 
In relation to the cash flow and the seasonality, yes, I mean our cash flow is seasonally stronger in the second half, definitely. And that's really on the back of several areas. Firstly, second half earnings are typically stronger and in particular Q4. So our Q4 earnings are our biggest quarter for the year. And typically, they're $100 million more than any other quarter in EBITDA. So you're getting stronger cash flow there. From a working capital standpoint, we tend to -- we tend to build working capital as we head through the year, getting into the summer period in Northern Hemisphere. And then you start to see some release of that as we head into the Q4 period. 
We clearly have a stronger focus on working capital as we close out the year, and we have some commercial terms that are favorable in the back half of the year. So when you put all that together, we've consistently delivered a stronger cash flow in the second half. And that's pretty -- where we are today is right in line with where we expect it to be.
On the working capital front, we've obviously had some headwind from the raw material pass-through as that gets through the cycling of the business. But that's more a timing situation than anything, and we expect that to improve as we head through the year. So from where we sit here today, the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion outlook, we feel really confident in. And that's -- we're in the normal cycle of the business cash flow seasonality."

I mean, when we issued the outlook, that full year guidance, you recall, we did that back in August. And at that time, we contemplated a range of external factors, including the continuing raw material inflation and general inflation, we were already experiencing supply chain constraints and raw material shortages at that time, and the demand was volatile. So that was -- some of that was already factored into the guidance that we put out there back in August. 
As we said, Q1 actually was pretty well right in line with where we expected to be at the end of Q1, some puts and takes in the result. But generally, the double-digit EPS growth was right where we expected it to be. And that gave us the confidence to reaffirm the guidance today around that 7% to 11% comparable constant currency growth. And that's just taking into account that range of factors that we've talked about. So to be at the upper end of that range, we'd expect seems like a quicker recovery in the health care and medical and pharmaceutical business that we've touched on during the call, perhaps a quicker recovery in the raw material pricing or abatement sooner than we're anticipating and perhaps less prolonged supply constraints. So that would get us to the upper end and the opposite is true for the lower end. If we see prolonged supply constraints further into the second half, then we anticipate then that could get us to the lower end as to if raw materials continue to increase. So that's all factored into our guidance that we gave back in August. And as I said, we are on track at the end of Q1, which gave us the confidence to reaffirm."

One is as you expand your protein business in Europe, do you have that managed by a sort of single person or area? Is that an initiative that's encapsulated from a managerial point of view? 
Second, are there particular subsegments you're targeting there? I'm learning that proximity to customers is important for that business, so do you need new plants? And are there any products like an EVOH sort of based film that I'm not sure if you have or need? And how many years is it going to take to achieve the harmonization of sales between these North America and Europe?

Look, it is one of the biggest growth opportunities we have. So I'm glad you asked the question. I might just start by talking about the approach globally and firstly, why we like this space and then our approach globally. 
The reason we like this space is because there is a lot of technology and a lot of material science required to package protein in a way that provides barrier protection and shelf life and also provides a consumer with an aesthetically pleasing option and something that stands out on the shelf. So there's a number of things required here. And some of these films, 9, 11 layers of different materials, all providing some sort of functionality and playing some sort of role. So this is a material science-based segment for the most part. That's common across the segments. In some segments, there are some other things required as well, including the right product format, whether it's bags or roll stock and sometimes a machinery offering as well to supplement it. So that's why we like the space. There's a lot to do there, and there's a lot of value to be created for our customers as they provide value to their consumers. 
And it's also not a space that everybody can play in because of the technology requirements. And so there's a couple of global player or players that compete in -- around the globe in this area, but there's not a very long list. So that's where we like it. 
Now as far as how we're managing it internally, our businesses generally decentralized, and a lot of the action happens on the ground in the different regions. But in this space, there is global coordination occurring in a couple of ways. Firstly, the product development agenda is global already. So we're not developing 1 product for a certain application in North America and then doing something different in Europe. There's a global product development road map to support the protein space. 
And secondly, as it relates to capital, as we think about deploying capital in this space, we're going to do that in a coordinated way as well. And so we have a global capital plan to support the protein space. 
And maybe just a last point on -- as it relates to capital because you asked about plants. There's not any need that we can see for new factories, per se. The material will ship. Proximity is always important to a certain extent, but these are high-value products. So we don't anticipate new plants necessarily, but we will be expanding our capacity in the conversion assets.

There's more national -- there's a collection of national markets in Europe versus a bit more of a homogeneous backdrop in North America. So that creates a little bit more complexity, which means things evolve generally more slowly in that -- on that continent. 
Look, I think these are medium-term growth opportunities. Protein would fall into the medium-term bucket. And what does that mean? That's the sort of 3- to 4-year range. And some of that is because the qualification periods are fairly lengthy. Some of it is because in certain subsegments, there's a system sell that's required, which creates a bit more lead time. And then there's just the pounding of the pavement and getting out in front of customers. So I would say it's more of a medium term. It's not necessarily a this year thing, although this segment is growing for us and has actually -- right through the pandemic, we've had mid-single-digit growth in protein around the world and some quarters higher than that.

And then in Rigid Packaging, it's almost hard to quantify, but there would have been at least 2% to 3% as we could estimate. And that probably doesn't take into account the full demand in beverage. And the beverage space in liquid refreshment beverages packaged in PET containers has continued to just grow very, very well. And so that 2% to 3% is probably understating what the real demand is.

We had winter storms here in North America in, I think, in February, which led to some plant outages and some plant damage, and some of the shutdowns go back all the way to that period in time. We were wearing some of that through the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year last year, and then that's continued. We've had a couple of suppliers with [ rail ] issues. One, in particular, in North America related to that winter storm and then taking some preventative downtime during hurricane season, just a litany of issues leading to us being at less than 100% allocation. And we also had another supplier that we source from in South America, and we also time source up in North America to supplement, who had a plant going fire in Brazil and take that plant down for quite some period of time. That actually happened in this most recent quarter. So in one way, shape or form, we've had supply disruptions on the PET resin side from in this calendar year."

It's not so much the number of layers, it's the composition of the layers. And we've got a number of innovations that are going to help us compete on the basis of better products in the protein space. We launched one last year called Eco-Tite, which is a recycle-ready PVDC-free shrink bag. So it becomes recyclable, not because it eliminates multiple layers. In fact, on the contrary, we'll continue to have multiple layers, but they will all be of the same chemistry so they're consistent with existing recycling streams. So that is a really important part of the protein opportunity for us is to innovate against the sustainability requirements that are now out there as compared to some of the legacy structures that haven't had those features in mind. So that's that one. 
On the first point, look, any of these single-use plastic bans that have been put in place around the world don't affect us because they're predominantly focused on food service items, shopping carrier bags, not the primary packaging that we're making for consumer food and health care products."

I think that it's, in some ways, linked to virgin, but I think it's almost decoupled from that, Andrew. I think it's more the supply versus the demand for recycled content. And as it relates to rigid containers which can be made from 100% recycled material, the demand continues to strengthen as brand owners look to feature that as part of their marketing.

Thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2022 first quarter results. Joining me today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. 
We start with safety because it's the first and most important of our values and the highest priority for every one of our 46,000 people around the world. And Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries, and our safety performance remains a real highlight. 
Across the group, we reduced the number of injuries by 16% compared to the prior year, and 62% of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. As we continue to make strong progress, it reinforces our conviction that an objective of no injuries is absolutely possible, and we continue striving towards that goal. 
We have 4 key messages today that sit here on Slide 4. First, Amcor is navigating well through challenging external conditions that we highlighted in August. And like the rest of our industry, including our customers and suppliers, we're experiencing unprecedented complexity across the supply chain, but we're performing well, and we remain on track to deliver on our expectations for the year. We're able to say that confidently because we're leveraging our scale and global reach, we are relying on the capabilities and experience of our management teams, and we're maintaining an unwavering focus on the right priorities, in particular, security of supply for our customers, recovery of higher input costs, and managing the sales mix. 
The second message today is that Amcor delivered a solid first quarter. While sales were tempered by supply chain challenges in some parts of the business, we delivered another solid quarter of double-digit earnings growth, which was in line with our expectations. 
Third, we're reaffirming fiscal '22 guidance, and we remain on track to meet the fiscal '22 earnings growth and cash flow objectives that we provided in August. 
And finally, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years. And today, Amcor is better positioned strategically than ever. In addition to delivering against short-term priorities, we remain focused on our long-term strategy and track record of growth and value creation. 
Turning to the financial highlights on Slide 5. The business delivered a solid start to the fiscal year. Our 10% reported net sales growth includes approximately $285 million of price increases related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. We're incredibly proud of the way our teams have continued to successfully steer us through this environment of ongoing inflation, achieving significant recovery over the last several quarters, and we'll continue to manage this dynamic going forward. Excluding this pass-through impact, organic sales grew 1%. In this environment, we're maintaining focus on our long-term strategy of optimizing mix, and it's clear that volume performance in both segments would have been higher in an unconstrained environment. 
Overall, EBIT increased 7% in comparable constant currency terms, which was right in line with expectations. The Flexibles segment had a strong quarter, generating earnings growth of 8%, driven by favorable mix and outstanding management of costs. 
In Rigid Packaging, the business in North America experienced a particularly challenging environment, including elevated demand, combined with full capacity utilization and constraints of critical inputs which resulted in operating inefficiencies and higher costs. 
Net income and EPS were both up at double-digit rates, increasing by 10% and 12%, respectively. And our financial profile remains strong. We increased cash returns to shareholders during the quarter, including repurchases of $64 million of shares, and the Board declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. So the key message here is that the business remains focused and continues to execute well. 
And with that, I'll hand over to Michael."

The Flexibles business performed very well during the period, delivering growth in high-value end markets, executing well to recover inflation and demonstrating strong cost performance. 
Reported sales growth of 10% includes recovery of higher raw material costs, which increased through the quarter. Actions we have taken to pass through those high costs drove sales up by approximately $210 million, which, on an annual basis, is well over $800 million and represented growth of 9% in the quarter compared with last year. The overall price/cost impact was unfavorable, but has remained manageable given the diversity of materials we'll buy, the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of inflation-driven pricing actions. This is once again evident in our margins, which remained at a level equal to the prior year despite the impact of higher raw material costs and related pricing recovery. 
Excluding this raw material impact, organic revenue growth of 1% was driven by favorable price/mix of approximately 2%. Consistent with our long-term strategy, the business has remained focused on mix with continued growth in higher-value end markets, including pet food, premium coffee and medical. This growth more than offset the sales impact of lower volumes in segments such as home and personal care and across Southeast Asia. In addition, shortages of certain raw materials, including aluminum and specialty resins, had a dampening effect on volume performance in some categories, including health care and protein-related products. 
Adjusted EBIT was up 8% in comparable constant currency terms for the quarter and reflects a favorable mix, strong productivity and cost improvements. 
Turning to the Rigid Packaging business on Slide 7. We delivered reported sales growth of 13%, reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Comparable constant currency sales growth of 1% was driven by higher overall volumes. In North America, beverage volumes were marginally ahead of the same period last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were 1% lower against a strong comparative period of double-digit growth, and higher demand in juice categories was offset by lower sports drinks volumes. Specialty container volumes were lower against the prior year, which benefited from strong volumes in the home and personal care category. 
In Latin America, double-digit volume growth reflects strong performance in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, and earnings were higher in the region. In constant currency terms, segment earnings were adversely impacted by inefficiencies and higher costs in North America, resulting from unprecedented industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions. 
Overall demand remained elevated and increasingly volatile in the beverage segment. At the same time, the business continued to operate at full capacity and we put historically low levels of inventory. This, coupled with further inflation and shortages for key inputs, including PET and certain specialty resins, resulted in operating efficiencies and higher costs in order to service customer demand. While we expect these dynamics to persist in the second quarter, we anticipate current challenges will improve through the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 8. As a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year. And for the current quarter, adjusted free cash outflow of $242 million compares with an outflow of $190 million last year. The increased outflow mainly reflects higher uses of cash related to working capital with the adverse impact related to timing of higher raw material costs cycling through the business. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance. And our rolling 12-month average working capital to sales ratio at the end of September remains below 8%. 
As planned, capital expenditure is tracking higher than last year as we have stepped up organic investments in key high-growth segments and geographies. Amcor's financial profile remains solid with leverage at 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is in line with our expectations for this time of year. And cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter were higher than the prior year, which reflects $64 million of share repurchases mentioned earlier and an increase in dividend per share. 
Taking us to the outlook on Slide 9. A solid first quarter of double-digit EPS growth, in line with our expectations, enables us to reaffirm the 2022 guidance we outlined in August. We continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis, which represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year. 
Free cash flow is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and the growing cash flow enables us to continue to pay a compelling growing dividend and allocate cash to share repurchases, which we expect will be around $400 million in fiscal '22, while retaining the flexibility to fund acquisitive growth when needed. 
So with that, I'll hand back to Ron."

Before closing and turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the longer term, starting on Slide 10, which summarizes the investment case for Amcor. 
Over the last several years, we've continued to execute against our strategy, strengthen our capabilities and establish a stronger foundation for growth and value creation. And as a result, we believe Amcor is better positioned strategically and our investment case is as strong as ever. 
In simple terms, that investment case starts with our market positions. We're the global leader in most of our chosen segments with relative and absolute scale advantages in every region and significant exposure to attractive high-value end markets across food, beverage and health care. We have a proven track record of consistent earnings growth and margin expansion, and we generate significant free cash flow every year, including between the $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in this 2022 fiscal year. With a strong balance sheet, that cash flow provides substantial capacity to invest in the long-term potential of our business and also to deliver a significant and growing amount of cash to shareholders. 
We use our shareholder value creation framework, which is shown here on Slide 11, to describe how we allocate cash flow every year and how that translates into value for shareholders. 
Through the combination of reinvestment in the base business, M&A and share repurchases, we expect to generate 5% to 10% constant currency EPS growth each year. Our dividend has historically yielded around 4% and continues to be especially compelling in such a low interest rate environment. But through economic and commodity cycle, the outcome of allocating capital in this way has resulted in average value creation through a combined EPS growth and dividend yield of about 13.5% each year, in line with the 10% to 15% you see here on this slide, and we're very well positioned to continue that trend. 
The strategic choices we've made guide how we prioritize investments back into the business, and we're investing now in several areas that will continue to drive long-term organic growth, and those are highlighted on Slide 12. 
First, our business mix is increasingly oriented towards the most attractive segments, which offer greater potential for differentiation and growth like health care, pet food, premium coffee and hot fill beverages. Our results this quarter provide strong evidence of how the considered choices we make every day lead to these attractive segments, representing an increasing percentage of our sales mix, which contributes to consistent margin expansion over time even while navigating complex environments like the one we're in now. 
Second, we continue to invest to expand our leading emerging market positions. We had another quarter of double-digit growth in both China and India, for example, and we're actively investing in these markets where we expect to see demand remain a tailwind for the foreseeable future. 
And third, we remain uniquely positioned to launch a steady stream of innovative new packaging solutions. We're investing in our innovation capabilities and network of global innovation centers so we can capitalize on what we believe is our greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation, and that is the demand for more sustainable packaging. 
Slide 13 highlights what we see as the 3 requirements for responsible packaging, and we're seeing clear progress on each of the 3: package design; waste management infrastructure; and consumer participation. In the past, we've highlighted examples of groundbreaking new product platforms like AmLite, AmPrima and AmSky, but we're also actively collaborating with others to develop solutions that address infrastructure and consumer participation. Most of these initiatives start small, but all have the benefit of demonstrating working models that can be scaled and leveraged across markets and customers. 
In Colombia, as an example, we partnered with one of our key customers and others across the value chain to achieve a fully circular bottle-to-bottle solution for amber-colored beverage containers where the color is critical for this particular brand. In Australia, we've enabled an iconic brand to transition confectionery packaging to a structure which incorporates 30% chemically recycled material. And finally, an example which is already functioning at scale globally, we've worked with the global market leader for single-serve premium coffee to increase the use of recycled aluminum, which is now at 80% for our core product line. 
In the next few weeks, we'll be releasing our 2021 sustainability report, which will describe our sustainability strategy and agenda more fully, and we'll provide more data in case studies to illustrate the strong progress we've made over the last 12 months. 
And finally, on Slide 14, a summary for today. Amcor delivered a solid first quarter results in line with expectations as we navigated well through a challenging external environment. This leaves us on track to meet our 2022 fiscal year guidance. And looking further ahead, we're better positioned strategically than ever before with a strong foundation for continued growth and value creation. 
So with that, operator, we'll close our opening remarks and open the line for questions. Thanks."

So our guidance is just from August, and factors in pretty much the volume growth that you would expect from us in any given year. We're sort of low single digits, a little slower this first quarter. But predominantly because of some of the constraints we had in the supply chain, we would expect through the rest of the year, those will abate over time. 
And as it relates to the pricing, we haven't historically seen a lot of elasticity in the demand for the products that we're providing packaging for. Considering that these are defensive consumer staples on the food side, even the more premium products have been pretty resilient to price. There's been a lot of price taken already in many of those segments. And then obviously, on the health care side, it's probably even less so."

There are times when labor is hard to come by. That's definitely true. But more -- for us, it's been a supply situation on the raw material side that's been limiting. And it's predominantly been in some specialty resins that affect the Flexibles business and also the Specialty Container part of Rigid Plastics. These are resins that are not used in large quantities, but provide some particular feature, barrier or otherwise that have been on particularly short supply and have put us on allocation and we, in turn, have put customers in allocation in several segments across the business, including medical, where we had a rebound and had some growth, but not as much as we could have had. So specialty resins is 1 area. 
In PET, which is a predominant raw material in our Rigid Packaging business, we've been searching for resin for much of the quarter. In fact, probably back into the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year as a number of our suppliers have had disruptions of a variety of different sorts and have encountered force majeure. And then even for some of the aluminum grades that we use in pharmaceutical packaging, we've had limitations. And so again, we've had customers on allocation in the pharma space as well. So that's where we're seeing it. 
Now I think there's reasons to believe that there's relief in sight. Many of those specialty resins, we're starting to get some increased allocations. PET, over the next quarter or 2, should start to normalize as well. But certainly, in the first quarter, it provided a bit of a headwind."

And firstly, I would point out, this is a North American set of circumstances. The Latin American business has performed quite well with strong volume growth and higher earnings. 
In North America, we've got a unique set of circumstances. So firstly, the demand has remained elevated for quite some time, particularly in the beverage space. That has led to a depletion of inventories. We've been running with historically low inventories pretty much for the whole calendar year, and we're running flat out at pretty much full capacity utilization. On top of which then, we've had some supply disruptions, as I just alluded to on the PET side, which is the primary input. 
So all of those things conspiring at once have led to some inefficiencies and, therefore, higher cost in the business. Now as we look forward, we see these conditions abating certainly through the second half. I think we're going to wear much of that continuing through Q2. But in the second half, we believe these will ease. And that's for a few reasons. 
Firstly, we've got more capacity coming on stream. And we've had capacity coming on through this calendar year as well, but it's been consumed through the year, but there's more coming on stream, as we've called out in previous calls. Secondly, we will start to build inventory now through the fiscal second quarter, the calendar fourth quarter that is -- tends to be the low season where inventories get built and we will be building through this quarter. And then thirdly, on the raw material side, some of the dislocations there are easing. So the allocation level that we are living with from a PET perspective are starting to increase, and some of the capacity upstream with the PET resin suppliers is starting to come back to more normal levels. So we do see reasons to be optimistic, particularly around the second half, but we're going to wear these conditions now for the next few months for sure."

And health care for us is, broadly speaking, medical device packaging, which you alluded to, and then pharmaceutical packaging as well. And both of those segments have been impacted through COVID and have had demand at much lower levels than we would historically see. We would typically see mid-single-digit growth each year in both of those segments. And it's -- these are 2 attractive segments, high margins, high levels of differentiation, lots of innovation. So they are about as good places you can play in flexible packaging.
Medical has started to come back a bit. Demand conditions improved in the first quarter. We did see a bit of an uptick in some of the elective procedures that you referred to, which drive consumption of medical device packaging. So we saw some improvement through the quarter, but again, we were limited with some of the specialty resins that go into those products, and we ended up having to put some customers on allocation and not capturing the full rebound in demand. We would only anticipate demand to continue to build and get back to more normalized levels and some of the raw material challenges to ease, although we know we're not out of the woods yet on at least a couple of particular resins. 
On the pharmaceutical side, we've seen a very, very modest improvement in demand, not to the same extent as medical. And in particular, in that business in Europe, it's predominantly foil-based set of products. We've had some limitations on foil supply as well, which has held us back. But we would expect that, over time, as COVID recedes a bit and people get back to normal, these normal behavioral patterns that pharmaceutical consumption will return back to the levels it was prepandemic as well. So we're pretty bullish on these 2 segments long term, and there's just some, I guess, another couple of rigs here as we get back to normal."

And as Ron mentioned in the earlier comments, the teams have been really focused, not only on securing supply for us and making sure we've got as much as we can to service customers, but also getting that raw material recovery through the marketplace. And we were really pleased with where we got to in the quarter. 
You might recall at the end of Q4 last year, we had $100 million roughly flow through the sales line this quarter, all up around $280 million with $210 million of that in Flexibles. So pretty significant recovery. We did see some headwinds, particularly in Flexibles from that so -- but it was manageable. And outside of that, you saw that in our margins, where, year-on-year, the Flexibles margins actually were maintained at 13%. So we were pretty pleased with that result because if you take the raw material recovery out of the mix, margins in effect would have been about 100 basis points higher, so closer to 14% without that raw material recovery pass-through. 
So we're pretty pleased with where we got to in the quarter. We'd expect that there's still further recovery to come, obviously. And in Q2, we are contemplating still some lag in that price cost recovery as we work through the next quarter. And -- but the indices are quite mixed. Some indices are suggesting that the raw materials are perhaps tailing off a little and have reached their peak. In other areas and certain geographies around the world, still looking at some increases. So a little bit of a mixed position there as well, John. But that's all factored into our guidance range that we put out there for the full year."

So that's been an ongoing journey. We've got some capacity that's come on stream -- coming out stream this quarter and will continue in the next couple of quarters. 
As it relates to Flexibles, we have flagged a number of investments, including a new plant in China, which is midway through its construction. It's in the south of China, in the Guangdong province, which is going to add capacity for the health care business there as well as some of the other segments that we service in that area. We've been expanding and adding capacity on some of the sustainability platforms. There's more sustainable platforms that we've flagged. So we've talked about AmLite in the past and AmPrima. We're putting capital to work in both of those -- for both of those products as 2 examples. So I'd say the Flexibles capacity is targeted at those areas where we have the most differentiation, predominantly in emerging markets and also the more sustainable structures."

And in some cases, their businesses might be more labor intensive or energy intensive, and then they've got more acute impacts from those areas. And that has a ripple effect back up the chain. If the customers are not running their plant, we are limited in how much material we can ship. I think that particularly in North America, labor has been an issue. There's a lot of theories as to why that is. But our customers and Amcor are doing everything we can to keep our plants fully staffed. 
Transport, at times, has been a constraint as well. But we would expect that with investments that are being made, not by Amcor necessarily, but throughout the value chain and the supporting industries adjacent to it, that, that eventually will subside. I mean I don't think that we're going to adapt -- we're going to certainly adapt the supply chain to such pronounced shortages. I'm just not sure that's -- where this is all going to head."

Flexibles is a little bit mixed, and it's a bit of -- it's a story of individual materials, as I said, but there's more reasons for optimism than concern as it relates to Flexibles going forward as some of these materials ramp up and return to more normal production levels."

We are a net bigger buyer than any 1 customer, and we've been able to get resin to keep some of those beverage customers supplied. 
We've got a couple of other examples in Flexibles. In the medical space, we've taken share at a customer in the medical device area by being able to supply material that our competitors could not supply. So I think that no one likes to be on allocation. And certainly, that's not where we want to be.

So on the corporate cost side, yes, there's definitely some phasing element in there, more so in the prior year. In Q1, we had and an insurance claim we had to provide for in Q1 last year, and that's really the key difference in the corporate costs. We'd expect by the half, the phasing there more normalizes to be more in line with the corporate costs position at the half last year. So that's kind of the impact on that front. And corporate costs, generally, in the first half is lighter than the second half just as we share our provisions and accruals and things like employee incentives and how they tend to happen in the second half as we progress through the year. So that's really the key difference there from the June quarter. 
In relation to the cash flow and the seasonality, yes, I mean our cash flow is seasonally stronger in the second half, definitely. And that's really on the back of several areas. Firstly, second half earnings are typically stronger and in particular Q4. So our Q4 earnings are our biggest quarter for the year. And typically, they're $100 million more than any other quarter in EBITDA. So you're getting stronger cash flow there. From a working capital standpoint, we tend to -- we tend to build working capital as we head through the year, getting into the summer period in Northern Hemisphere. And then you start to see some release of that as we head into the Q4 period. We clearly have a stronger focus on working capital as we close out the year, and we have some commercial terms that are favorable in the back half of the year. So when you put all that together, we've consistently delivered a stronger cash flow in the second half. And that's pretty -- where we are today is right in line with where we expect it to be.
On the working capital front, we've obviously had some headwind from the raw material pass-through as that gets through the cycling of the business. But that's more a timing situation than anything, and we expect that to improve as we head through the year. So from where we sit here today, the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion outlook, we feel really confident in. And that's -- we're in the normal cycle of the business cash flow seasonality."

I mean when we issued the outlook, that full year guidance, you recall, we did that back in August. And at that time, we contemplated a range of external factors, including the continuing raw material inflation and general inflation. We were already experiencing supply chain constraints and raw material shortages at that time, and the demand was volatile. So that was -- some of that was already factored into the guidance that we put out there back in August. As we said, Q1 actually was pretty well right in line with where we expect it to be at the end of Q1. Some puts and takes in the result, but generally, the double-digit EPS growth was right where we expected it to be. And that gave us the confidence to reaffirm the guidance today around that 7% to 11% comparable constant currency growth. And that's just taking into account that range of factors that we've talked about. 
So to be at the upper end of that range, we'd expect things like a quicker recovery in the health care and medical and pharmaceutical business that we've touched on during the call, perhaps a quicker recovery in the raw material pricing or abatement sooner than we're anticipating and perhaps less prolonged supply constraints. So that would get us to the upper end and the opposite is true for the lower end. If we see prolonged supply constraints further into the second half, then we anticipate then that could get us to the lower end as to if raw materials continue to increase. So that's all factored into our guidance that we gave back in August. And as I said, we are on track at the end of Q1, which gave us the confidence to reaffirm."

One is as you expand your protein business in Europe, do you have that managed by a sort of single person or area? Is that an initiative that's encapsulated from a managerial point of view? Second, are there particular subsegments you're targeting there? I'm learning that proximity to customers is important for that business, so do you need new plants? And are there any products like an EVOH sort of based film that I'm not sure if you have or need? And how many years is it going to take to achieve the harmonization of sales between these North America and Europe?

Look, it is one of the biggest growth opportunities we have. So I'm glad you asked the question. I might just start by talking about the approach globally, and firstly, why we like this space and then our approach globally. The reason we like",448,"Yes. Okay. Look, it is one of the biggest growth opportunities we have. So I'm glad you asked the question. I might just start by talking about the approach globally, and firstly, why we like this space and then our approach globally. 
The reason we like this space is because there is a lot of technology and a lot of material science required to package protein in a way that provides barrier protection and shelf life and also provides a consumer with an aesthetically pleasing option and something that stands out on the shelf. So there's a number of things required here. And some of these films, 9, 11 layers of different materials, all providing some sort of functionality and playing some sort of role. So this is a material science-based segment for the most part. That's common across the segments. In some segments, there are some other things required as well, including the right product format, whether it's bags or roll stock and sometimes a machinery offering as well to supplement it. 
So that's why we like the space. There's a lot to do there, and there's a lot of value to be created for our customers as they provide value to their consumers. And it's also not a space that everybody can play in because of the technology requirements. And so there's a couple of global player or players that compete in -- around the globe in this area, but there's not a very long list. So that's where we like it. 
Now as far as how we're managing it internally, our businesses generally decentralized, and a lot of the action happens on the ground in the different regions. But in this space, there is global coordination occurring in a couple of ways. Firstly, the product development agenda is global already. So we're not developing 1 product for a certain application in North America and then doing something different in Europe. There's a global product development, a road map, to support the protein space. 
And secondly, as it relates to capital, as we think about deploying capital in this space, we're going to do that in a coordinated way as well. And so we have a global capital plan to support the protein space. 
And maybe just a last point on -- as it relates to capital because you asked about plants. There's not any need that we can see for new factories, per se. The material will ship. Proximity is always important to a certain extent, but these are high-value products. So we don't anticipate new plants necessarily, but we will be expanding our capacity in the conversion assets.  Did I cover all of that?"

There's more national -- there's a collection of national markets in Europe versus a bit more of a homogeneous backdrop in North America. So that creates a little bit more complexity, which means things evolve generally more slowly in that -- on that continent. 
Look, I think these are medium-term growth opportunities. Protein would fall into the medium-term bucket. And what does that mean? That's the sort of 3- to 4-year range. And some of that is because the qualification periods are fairly lengthy. Some of it is because in certain subsegments, there's a system [ cell ] that's required, which creates a bit more lead time. And then there's just the pounding of the pavement and getting out in front of customers. So I would say it's more of a medium term. It's not necessarily a this year thing, although this segment is growing for us and has actually -- right through the pandemic, we've had mid-single-digit growth in protein around the world and some quarters higher than that.

That's a good question. I think best we can do is give you an estimate. We'd say it was a couple of percentage points overall and, basically, have kept us from getting to the growth rates that we would expect in this business, which is low single digit.
In Flexibles, best we could estimate, it probably was 1% to 2%. And again, that's in some of the segments we've already talked about, including medical, where we did have good growth. But we're not as much as we would have liked, including protein and meat, back to Larry's question, to name 2, and certainly, in pharma. And then in Rigid Packaging, it's almost hard to quantify, but there would have been at least 2% to 3% as we could estimate. And that probably doesn't take into account the full demand in beverage. And the beverage space in liquid refreshment beverages packaged in PET containers has continued to just grow very, very well. And so that 2% to 3% is probably understating what the real demand is. That's probably a constrained view of demand as our customers would express it. 
So I think put all that together, Adam, and we would say it's probably about 2%, low single digits, which is where the business typically is from a top line perspective."

And we were wearing some of that through the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year, last year, and then that's continued. We've had a couple of suppliers with real issues. One, in particular, in North America related to that winter storm and then taking some preventative downtime during hurricane season. Just a litany of issues leading to us being at less than 100% allocation. 
And we also had another supplier that we source from in South America. And we also time source up in North America to supplement who had a plant going fire in Brazil and take that plant down for quite some period of time. That actually happened in this most recent quarter. So in one way, shape or form, we've had supply disruptions on the PET resin side from -- early in this calendar year."

So did you see any volume impact from these movements? 
And related to sustainability, before you mentioned protein, you like the complexity of the material science and protein films, the multilayer, different types of materials there. But isn't this exactly what you're trying to change and simplify to make actually your films more sustainable to get away from this structure?"

It's not so much the number of layers, it's the composition of the layers. And we've got a number of innovations that are going to help us compete on the basis of better products in the protein space. We launched one last year called Eco-Tite, which is a recycle-ready PVDC-free shrink bag. So it becomes recyclable, not because it eliminates multiple layers. In fact, on the contrary, we'll continue to have multiple layers, but they will all be of the same chemistry so they're consistent with existing recycling streams. So that is a really important part of the protein opportunity for us is to innovate against the sustainability requirements that are now out there as compared to some of the legacy structures that haven't had those features in mind. So that's that one. 
On the first point, look, any of these single-use plastic bans that have been put in place around the world don't affect us because they're predominantly focused on food service items, shopping carrier bags, not the primary packaging that we're making for consumer food and health care products."

As Michael said, we're just there on about $200 million for the quarter in Flexibles alone, almost $300 million for the quarter overall.
