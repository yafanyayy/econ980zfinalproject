Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to 2020 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free",3525,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to 2020 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Fourth quarter shipments, margins and profitability were all well ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was primarily due to higher shipments of home standby generators from better-than-expected production output. We're also pleased that shipments of PowerCell Energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the quarter. The ongoing elevated level of power outages, combined with the emerging home is a sanctuary trend, continue to drive unprecedented levels of demand for home standby generators across the entire U.S. We continue to aggressively ramp production levels for home standby throughout the fourth quarter to all-time record daily build rates. 
Despite this expanding production, the ongoing robust demand created substantial backlog for these products at the end of the year, far exceeding anything previously experienced in the history of the product category. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased approximately 28% on a core growth basis as compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the dramatic increase in sales of home standby generators followed by the continued ramp of PowerCell Energy storage systems. In addition, the higher power outage activity also drove elevated shipments of portable generators and aftermarket service parts and shore products also improved at a strong rate as compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this significant strength was a decline in shipments of C&I products, given the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin expanded 180 basis points compared to the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin increased 380 basis points over the prior year to an impressive 25.7%, which was the highest margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I wanted to provide some full year 2020 financial highlights as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. First and foremost, I want to highlight the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As I'm extremely proud of our team's efforts in responding to the crisis as we focus on maintaining our operations to the fullest extent possible. This was particularly important considering that our products and services are both essential and critical to help keep a variety of networks and infrastructure up and running, including hospitals, health care clinics, 911 call centers and wireless networks. Equally as important, we accomplished this while at the same time, implementing a wide range of preventative measures to address the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities across the world where we operate and do business. Through the tireless execution of our nearly 7,000 employees globally during 2020, Generac achieved another year of record financial results across the board as several metrics far exceeded the previous record level seen for the full year 2019. 
Revenue grew 13% for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA coming in at $584 million, an expansion of 290 basis points to 23.5%, and we generated $427 million of free cash flow during the year. Our ability to execute on the step function increase in demand for residential products that has emerged from the new Home as a Sanctuary megatrend, was an important accomplishment during 2020. 
In addition, the building out of our clean energy market opportunity with the significant ramp in shipments of PowerCell Energy Storage systems was a key highlight. We also expanded our product and services portfolio with the acquisitions of Energy Systems, our industrial distributor located in Northern California; and Mean Green, a leading manufacturer of an innovative line of battery-powered turf care products. 
We also made the very strategic acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, which enables our entrants into the developing market for grid services. We launched important new products during the year with the introduction of the 24-kilowatt home standby generator, the market's most powerful air-cooled unit with built-in energy monitoring. We also introduced the industry's largest rich burn industrial natural gas generator set at 1 megawatt of output, allowing us to target new market opportunities. All of these key accomplishments as well as our execution on a number of other strategic initiatives, enabled us to make important progress on our continuing evolution to an energy technology solutions company. Our prior year accomplishments provide us with tremendous momentum as we head into 2021. The guidance we are initiating this morning calls for significant revenue growth of between 25% to 30%, highlighted by unprecedented home standby demand, continuing expansion of the clean energy markets and recovering C&I markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to expand to 24% to 25%, for the full year 2021. Despite near-term supply chain concerns related to capacity constraints, increasing cost pressures and logistics delays across the business as we enter the new year. York will provide more details on our 2021 guidance and the outlook portion of our prepared remarks today. 
Now let me provide a few more details on our accomplishments across the business for the fourth quarter and for full year 2020. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continue to be exceptionally strong during the fourth quarter. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year. Broad-based strength was experienced across the U.S. during the fourth quarter, similar to the trends seen in recent quarters, with the vast majority of states showing triple digit growth, which we believe provides further validation for the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend. 
Activations also grew at a strong rate compared to the prior year, led by significant increases in the South Central, Southeast and Northeast regions. The power outage severity environment also continued to be quite favorable and trended well above the long-term baseline average. Benefiting from a record Atlantic hurricane season, early winter storms and continued power shutoffs in California. We also ended the fourth quarter with approximately 7,300 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 dealers over the last 12 months. This includes the addition of a significant number of new dealers in California during the year as we ended 2020 with approximately 550 dealers in the state. 
Importantly, thus far, in the first quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to prior year levels. Home consultations are tracking at approximately double the prior year levels through early February. We believe this increase can be attributed to several factors that are leading to the product category becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work from home, learn from home, entertain from home and shop from home. 
With demand for home standby generators at all-time highs, we continue to aggressively ramp our supply chain and production output, and we achieved progressively higher record daily build rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect to further expand capacity for these products with our announcement yesterday of plans to open a new manufacturing assembly and distribution operation in Trenton, South Carolina. The facility will support increased demand for home standby generators and certain other energy technology products and serve as a distribution center to customers in the southeastern part of the country. Creating approximately 450 new jobs over the next 2 years. 
The facility is expected to be operational by midyear and once fully ramped, is projected to increase home standby capacity by approximately 75% relative to our previous normal levels as we entered 2020, with the ability to further expand the facility well beyond its current size in the future. 
Our operations teams did an amazing job during 2020, ramping production of production output of home standby generators to record daily build rates by the end of the year. But despite the significant increase in output, lead times for home standby generators continue to expand from the approximately 18 weeks at the end of 2020 to approximately 20 weeks today. 
As a result, the substantial backlog for these products continues to grow so far here in the first quarter, despite our normal seasonal low point for residential products as home consultations and orders remain very robust. 
Now I want to provide an update this morning on our rapidly expanding energy storage systems effort and recent entrants into the grid services market. We made tremendous progress during 2020 with our continuing transformation into an Energy Technology solutions company. As we significantly ramp deliveries of our PowerCell Energy storage system and with our entry into the market for grid services through the Enbala acquisition last October. 
The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring, and energy management systems remains very compelling and has considerable momentum as we head into 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell Energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the fourth quarter. As revenue for these products continue to ramp as they increased approximately 75% on a sequential basis and were a key contributor to the company's year-over-year growth. 
Overall, for 2020, shipments of PWRcell Energy storage systems increased significantly during the first year of commercial launch. Particularly during the second half, and we're in line with our previous guidance of approximately $115 million for the full year. The tremendous growth in energy storage from essentially a start-up business was due to the important advances we have made in growing our capabilities around marketing, distribution, product development and sourcing of these products. 
We further developed and refined our targeted marketing and home consultation processes and have been very encouraged by the trends with sales leads for PWRcell systems as they continue to be strong during the fourth quarter and have increased further here in the early parts of the first quarter. 
System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, also continued to ramp notably during the fourth quarter, with this strength continuing so far through the early part of 2021. An important element of expanding our sales and marketing efforts for clean energy is the progress we continue to make building out the distribution network for these products. As we trained approximately 4,200 energy storage consultants or contractors in 2020. 
We continue to receive positive feedback from our growing dealer base regarding the ease of installation, the whole home power and capacity of the PWRcell systems and the qualified sales leads being generated for them. We have continued -- also continue to advance our supply chain capabilities through increased volume and reduced system costs and achieved our first full quarter of profitability during Q4. We also had several important new product introductions last year, and we have a very strong pipeline of innovative new clean energy-related products that will be coming to market over the next several quarters. This includes deep integration with our legacy generator products and includes the launch later this year of a purpose-built generator solution that can be combined with a solar and storage system to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid. 
Additionally, we will be launching the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell storage system to an existing solar installation. And later in 2021, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PowerView energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe this system will be an industry -- will be industry-leading in terms of the technology and cost and will enable far greater control at the circuit level than is available today. When added as part of a solar and storage installation, a homeowner could effectively tailor their system to optimize for lowest cost or longest duration or some combination depending on their preferences or certain other factors. An example would be to allow the system to react to a power outage by prioritizing those loads deemed critical by a homeowner to extend the duration of their available energy storage. 
We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole house storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide the energy independence and flexibility we believe consumers really want in these systems. The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly. And we expect to see significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as shipments of PWRcell Energy Storage systems are anticipated to increase substantially as we're expecting them to grow approximately 50% to 75% as compared to 2020 levels. 
Recall early in the fourth quarter that we closed on the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, a leading distributed energy Resources technology company based in Denver, Colorado. Enbala's  best-in-class software platform called, gives utilities, grid operators and energy retailers, the ability to connect and utilize distributed energy resources, also known as DERs, to help support the operational stability of the power grid thereby enabling us to participate in the nascent and growing market opportunity for grid services. 
DER assets, which include our legacy residential and C&I generators, PWRcell Energy storage systems and load management devices can be connected to the concerto platform and can be aggregated into a decentralized and virtual power plant network or VPP. 
VPP provides flexible capacity to address peaks and electricity demand variability in supply due to increasing use of renewables and when resiliency is needed as a result of power outages. While still very early in the integration process, we have made progress in developing a road map for integrating Enbala software into our existing generator products and energy storage systems as part of an overall plan to provide a full suite of solutions for utilities, energy retailers, grid operators and end users. 
As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe the integration of Enbala's   technology will enable us to not only improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products, but will also allow us to participate and develop new revenue streams in the years ahead. The solutions will be built around our products that generate, store and manage power and that can be aggregated and controlled, resulting in the potential for revenue from sales of software platforms turnkey operations services and ultimately, Performance services that can deliver megawatts of power. 
All of these efforts are targeted at enabling the equipment we provide to be connected more seamlessly as DERs in grid services applications. And in turn, improve the value proposition of these assets, which we -- which we believe will lead to increased demand for our products. 
Now shifting gears, let me provide an update on C&I. As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse impact on the overall market for global C&I power generation and related equipment given major declines in GDP growth rates around the world. While uncertainty remains around the pandemic, we are encouraged that the year-over-year revenue decline moderated as certain end markets began to show signs of recovery. As expected, shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers continued to decline significantly during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. As we dealt with the challenging demand environment for mobile products throughout 2020, we focused our efforts on cost reductions and other restructuring actions, which we began implementing during the second quarter of last year. As we enter 2021, we expect shipments to improve from prior year levels as national account rental customers increase their spending on fleet equipment. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products as an expected fleet replacement cycle begins and the compelling mega trend that remains intact around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could potentially benefit from economic stimulus. Shipments to national telecom customers increased at a significant rate during the quarter as compared to the prior year. With the magnitude of the increase pacing ahead of our prior expectations. 
We continue to see indications from several of our large telecom customers of an improving outlook, and we expect that to translate into very strong growth in shipments during 2021. Recall that demand trends for these customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of their capital spending and their project planning cycles. Historically, however, demand for telecom backup power tends to increase after periods of elevated power outage activity. Similar to what was experienced with the outage environment during the second half of 2020. 
In addition, revenue growth during the current year is expected to benefit from the power security mandate in California, which requires a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all cell tower locations. We estimate that this new requirement in the state, which went into the effect at the beginning of this year could lead to purchases of between $100 million to $200 million in new equipment from wireless operators over the next 3 years. Also shipments to other national account customers are expected to show a considerable ramp in 2021 as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives through increasing quote activity and improving project close rates for our natural gas generators, which are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. 
Lastly, net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were lower in the quarter as expected due to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2019, which created a difficult prior year comparison. As mentioned on our last call, project quoting activity is largely recovered since the onset of the pandemic during the second quarter, contributing to a higher backlog and improved overall order outlook for this channel. And as a result, we're expecting growth to resume during 2021. We're also expecting growth from the Energy Systems business, our industrial distributor located in Northern California that we acquired on July 1 last year as our investments in integration activities begin to produce results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. 
Internationally, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a negative impact on C&I product demand during the fourth quarter as well. As GDP growth rate slowed materially around the world in 2020, revenues for our international segment in the fourth quarter declined approximately 6% on a core basis when compared to the prior year. This decline was driven by continued weakness in a number of key regions around the world. But overall, international revenue during the fourth quarter was largely in line with our expectations. Similar to our domestic C&I products business, the international year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter was at a notably lesser rate relative to recent quarters as signs of recovery began to appear in certain regions. While COVID-19 impacts are still being felt, larger project quoting and order activity is increasing, and we expect the international segment to return to solid growth during 2021. 
Also, it's important to reiterate that our international teams remain focused on several critical global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications, expanding our share in the wireless telecom backup power segment globally and entering the emerging energy storage market for both residential and C&I applications. 
In closing this morning, in recent years, we have continued to make important progress on evolving our business model from a focus on clean energy products with a focus on clean energy products, solutions and services, aligned with the changing legacy electric utility model. 
In 2019, we began providing energy storage, monitoring and management systems as clean energy solutions for residential use. And last year, we entered the market for grid services involving distributed energy optimization and control software that will help support the operational stability of the power grid. We've also been focused over the last several years on connecting the legacy standby generators we manufacture. Including building out our digital platform that creates tremendous value for our customers and our distribution partners over the product life cycle. As the leader in backup power solutions, we believe we are in the unique position to enable the potential utilization of these products as distributed energy resources on a very large scale, thereby providing us with a distinct advantage as the nascent market for grid services expands over the next several years. 
Going forward, we intend to further build out our capabilities as an energy technology solutions provider through organic investment and continued acquisitions. We expect to expand our energy storage capabilities beyond residential applications into C&I markets and eventually globally and further expand our capabilities with energy monitoring and management devices and grid services. These are incredibly exciting times at Generac as we've now built an incredible foundation for growth and we have the financial flexibility to be a major player in developing the energy grid of the future. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter results and some outlook details for 2021. York?"
78749412,702555833,2205798,"Generac Holdings Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Generac Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record. As compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The comb",2751,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record. As compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from the energy systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2020 increased 12.7% to approximately $2.5 billion, also an all-time record for the company. 
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 54.6% to $498.7 million, as compared to $322.5 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which accelerated to over 40% during the fourth quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell Energy storage systems continue to significantly ramp during the quarter as the solar plus storage market expands at a rapid pace in the U.S. and we continue to build out our capabilities selling into this -- into the clean energy space. Also contributing to the growth were a large increase in shipments of portable generators during the quarter which benefited from the much higher power outage activity as compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, shipments of core products were also much higher during the quarter as the Home as a Sanctuary trend positively impacted demand for outdoor power equipment. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 declined 8.5% to $198.6 million as compared to $217.1 million in the prior year quarter. The weakness in shipments of C&I products was experienced both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in our national rental account customers to defer capital spending for our mobile products. And shipments to our industrial distributors also declined against a particularly strong prior year comparison. 
Partially offsetting these declines was a significant increase in shipments to national telecom account customers due to the capital spending outlook improving for these customers. Internationally, C&I products declined due to the continued weakness in demand across the majority of regions around the world as a result of pandemic. As mentioned, while still experiencing a year-over-year sales decline during the fourth quarter, the rate of decline for C&I products continue to moderate as certain end markets begin to recover. 
Net sales for the other products and services products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 24.4% to $63.8 million as compared to $51.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the energy systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. 
In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity during the second half of the year. A larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus the prior year. Gross profit margin improved 180 basis points to 39.4% compared to 37.6% in the prior year fourth quarter. 
Operating expenses increased $11.4 million or 9.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, but declined 270 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest as defined in our earnings release, was $195.8 million or a very strong 25.7% of net sales as compared to $129.1 million or 21.9% of net sales in the prior year. This 380 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter, primarily due to the favorable sales mix, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. 
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests came in at an all-time record of $584 million, resulting in an attractive 23.5% margin or a 290 basis point increase compared to the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 37.2% to $645.1 million as compared to $470.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $188 million for 29.1% of net sales as compared to $122.9 million in the prior year or 26.1% of net sales. 
For the full year 2020, domestic segment sales increased 19.8% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 27%, representing a 240 basis point increase compared to the prior year. International segment sales, which consists primarily of C&I products, declined 4.1% to $116 million as compared to $120.9 million in the prior year quarter. 
Foreign currency had a net favorable impact of approximately 140 basis points on revenue growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $7.8 million or 6.8% of net sales as compared to $6.2 million or 5.2% of net sales in the prior year. 
For the full year 2020, International segment sales declined 14.1% over the prior year to $396 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 5.1% of net sales during the 2020 compared to 5.5% of net sales in the prior year. 
Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $125 million as compared to $69.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $39 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.8% as compared to $13.4 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in pretax income in the current year, while the prior year quarter was impacted by more favorable discrete tax items, including a year-end revaluation adjustment related to a reduction in the blended state income tax rate. 
For the full year, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 22.2% compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.97 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $135.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.12 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $96.5 million in the prior year or $1.53 per share. Cash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $34.9 million as compared to $8.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects a cash income tax rate of 17.9% for the full year 2020, which is an increase from the approximately 16% rate previously expected for 2020. 
This also compares to the prior year rate of 15%. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year was primarily due to higher pretax income, which is taxed at the higher domestic statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was robust at $218.2 million as compared to $175.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $190.7 million as compared to $160.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the current year quarter, partially offset by the lower monetization of working capital and higher capital expenditures relative to the prior year. 
Before discussing our guidance initiation for 2021, I want to make a few comments regarding our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we had nearly $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of $655 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2023. 
Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $885 million, net of unamortized original issued discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was only 1.5x on an as-reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026, we do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low-cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. 
Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile, and for the full year 2020, free cash flow was easily an all-time record of $427 million as compared to $251 million in 2019, which was our previous record. Uses of cash during 2020 included $69 million for acquisitions, $62 million for capital expenditures and $25 million for the net repayment of debt. 
Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities. 
With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2021. Key demand metrics for home standby generators, including home consultations and orders continue to trend much higher during the fourth quarter relative to prior year levels, and this strength has continued thus far in the first quarter. Due to this ongoing unprecedented demand, which has extended lead times for these products, there was a substantial backlog awards for home standby generators at the end of 2020, which has further increased thus far in the first quarter. As we expand manufacturing capacity during 2021 with a new facility coming online, we expect to further ramp production levels for home standby generators, helping to alleviate this backlog. 
In addition, the solar plus storage market is expected to experience significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as storage attachment rates continue to climb, leading to the expectation of substantial growth in shipments of PWRcell Energy Storage Systems as we continue to build out our presence in this market. Although demand for C&I products during 2020 was negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year-over-year revenue declines continue to moderate, and shipments for these products are expected return to growth during 2021 across a number of key end markets and geographies. 
As a result of this positive top line outlook, we are initiating guidance for 2021 that anticipate significant revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Net sales are expected to increase between 25% to 30% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes shipments of residential products increased at a very robust rate during 2021 and a rate that is similar to the year-over-year growth rate experienced in 2020. Revenue for C&I products is expected to rebound at a strong rate as compared to the softer prior year comparisons, a rate approximately in the mid-teens range. 
Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages during the year in line with the long-term baseline average. However, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage venturing the year such as the category 3 or higher landed hurricane. Given current capacity constraints for home standby, the upside of a major power outage event would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2021 meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage event would most likely spill over into 2022. Due to the significant home standby backlog at the end of 2020, we're expecting the quarterly seasonality in 2021 to be more level loaded relative to normal historical patterns, with sales in the first half being approximately 48% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 52% weighted. 
As a result, total year-over-year growth is forecasted to be approximately 50% for each of the first and second quarters of the year. Looking at margin profile as we enter 2021, there are near-term cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain, which are resulting in higher input costs, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs and higher wages. We expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs to be largely offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our profit enhancement program. As a result, we expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be similar to the second half of 2020 run rate. 
In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, which is an increase from the 23.5% reported for the full year 2020. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the first half of the year to be moderately lower between 50 to 100 basis points relative to the second half of 2021. Given the full realization benefit from pricing and cost reduction issues in the back half of the year. 
As is our normal practice, we are providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. For 2021, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 23.5% to 24.5% as compared to the 22.2% full year rate for 2020. This increase is driven by higher pretax income and a higher mix of domestic pretax income relative to the prior year. Based on our guidance provided for 2021, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $135 million to $140 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2021 cash income tax rate of between 20.5% to 21.5%. As compared to the 17.9% rate for the full year 2020. 
As a reminder, our approximate $30 million per year tax shield that originated from the LBO transaction in 2006 fully expires at the end of this year. As a result, 2021 is the last year that adjusted earnings will benefit from a notably lower cash income tax rate relative to our GAAP income tax rate. 
Beginning in 2022, the cash tax rate is expected to be more in line with the GAAP tax rate in the 25% to 27% range. In 2021, we expect interest expense to be approximately $34 million assuming no additional principal payments during the year and flat LIBOR rates throughout 2021. Our capital expenditures for 2021 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity, and are projected to be between 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. This CapEx guidance includes the new and South Carolina facility and related equipment that we expect to bring online during the second half of 2021. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $40 million in 2021, given our assumed capital spending guidance. 
GAAP intangible amortization expenses in 2021 is expected to be approximately $34 million to $35 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $20 million to $24 million for the year. For our full year 2021, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow, expected to be approximately 90% for the year. 
Finally, our full year diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately $64 million to $64.5 million shares. This compares to $63.7 million shares in 2020. 
This 2021 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

It's -- I mean, obviously, capacity right now, Phil, is we're -- as you say, we're flat out. And we're starting to see actually capacity pressures even in our C&I business, which, thankfully, we have a brand-new plant down in Mexico that we brought online last year. We haven't talked a ton about it, but it's a beautiful facility. It's primarily there to serve the Latin American market, consolidation of our previous operations down in Mexico City. But we can use that facility as well for other things, and we'll probably end up doing some products for the U.S. and Canada down there simply just because we're, we're going to be up against some capacity things here, too, especially in the smaller C&I ranges for telecom, the telecom business is looking like it's -- the lineup there is pretty strong relative to demand. But on the -- back on the home standby side, yes, the new facility in Trenton is going to be a big boost. You're right. The 75% improvement that we say are increased that we've been indicating and capacity was off of the previous capacity limitations as we entered 2020. So we did raise those numbers over the course of 2020. So in effect, with that new facility coming online, we can get more capacity. And then that site is actually expandable. About 2, 2.5x it's existing size today if we choose to go that route. So to answer your question, when do we see catching this? We're going to be working hard all year-long to do that. 
Remember, recall that we do have some temporary production that we stood up in one of our other facilities here in Wisconsin. The initial plan was to take that down as we ramped up the Trenton facility over the summer. We could choose to leave -- if demand remains strong and every indication right now is that, that will be the case, we could leave that temporary capacity add online, which gives us kind of an incremental bump above where kind of we would be if it was just white water and Trenton. So -- but the way we've sized the equipment and everything in the Trenton facility, we think we'll be ramping throughout the full year and we'll kind of hit the ground running here midyear and hopefully be at kind of max rates by the end of the year, that would be the goal."

Lots of interest in the call. Well, anyway, I'll get to the questions here. So I wanted to talk about some of the demand dynamics you've seen around the Home as a Sanctuary theme. Have you discerned anything different in terms of the demographics or anything you pick up on the types of customers whose leads you're qualifying or maybe through channel conversations you've commented that it's a much broader swell of demand geographically. So many more states, for example. So that -- so it's clear that that's changed. I just wonder, for years and years, you've had a pretty pretty good insight into the types of folks who are interested in your products demographic wise? And I just wonder if you're seeing any shifts there as a part of this trend."

So unde",522,"Yes, it's a great question, Tommy, that the -- we do a ton of work around the demographics of the customer bases that buy those products over the years. It's just as the leader in that category and is building it out, we had to develop the market. So understanding who the buyer was and where the opportunities were. And frankly, one of the things we learned in that is understanding the buyer wasn't, right? So who wasn't buying the products and why? Who went through the sale process and didn't buy and why didn't they buy? Those are all important considerations. And to answer your question, though, demographically, typically, the product category historically is skewed older, right? So something on the order of 70% of the customers have been over age 50 historically. And that's really because homeownership kind of follows those trends. We have seen indications early in the pandemic, what we saw and it's a little bit dicey when we talk about this because you have to talk about that expansion in the geography. As an example, Florida was such a hot market last year for us and it's just typically demographically is an older market. So we actually saw our demo shift older. But when you strip out Florida, actually, the demo for other states was shifting younger, which is really fascinating. And I think what it speaks to, Florida was an interesting dynamic because you had a lot of people who went down over the winter last year, the pandemic started to take hold February and March, they chose to kind of shelter in place and stay in Florida. If they didn't own a generator, they came to the conclusion very quickly, they needed 1, because they were going to be basically stuck in Florida, and they would start to get worried about something that if you're not living there, you don't worry about over the summer, which is the hurricane season. So we saw marked interest in Florida by that market, and that led to kind of a skew towards older. But everywhere else, it was younger. And so what we're seeing is younger families, in particular, people who are moving out of cities, metro areas and into homes. And again, they're working from home now, in particular, they're not driving back into the city to go into an office. They're staying in their home. And so they start to connect the dots, and maybe they experience their first or their first outage in their new home, and they figure out very quickly just how vulnerable they are. And so you hear us use this term power security. We started introducing in the terminology here. And it's not an unfamiliar term for those around the industry, but this idea of making sure that you've got a continuous source of power to protect your home, your family, your livelihood is, I think, is really resonating across -- certainly across geographies as we talked. 
But demographically, I think it's resonating, in particular, with people who are shifting to that work from home model and learn from home model."

What is the potential ramp there look like here in North America? Maybe because you have such great market share on the resi side, not many others have talked about that concept, but it sounds like you have some product innovation in the pipeline that may enable it. And so I'm curious what the opportunity set looks like."

It's something that as part of the thesis behind the acquisition of Enbala was that, obviously, we make we make a lot of products that could be used as distributed energy resources, right?

It's something that as part of the thesis behind the acquisition of Enbala was that, obviously, we make we make a lot of products that could be used as distributed energy resources, right? So we have 2 million home standby generators on the ground. We have literally hundreds of megawatts of C&I product that we put in the market every year. It's actually -- if you step back and you think of the potential and it's -- I called it out in the prepared remarks, we think we're in this incredibly unique position, given the scale that we can bring to this with the assets that we already -- not only that we already have on the ground, but certainly that we put into the market on a year in and year out basis. And those assets, combined now with the technology, which is Enbala, the platform is the enablement of those assets to be used in a much more fulsome way, right? To the benefit of the end users, grid operators, utility companies, ourselves, right Generac. I mean there's an opportunity for us to participate in that. We haven't given really clear kind of longer-range guidance on this yet. Because we're trying to get our arms around, just what are the different business models that are out there and available to us, and there are a lot of them. I talked about a few of them in the script here today, but there's a lot of different ways we could play this. I think the opportunity doesn't begin, though, until we get the products to be connected to the Enbala network. And that's what our effort is here in the early innings. So we just closed on this acquisition in really the beginning of in October. So we've been diligently working on our road maps to make sure we can take our existing residential generators, our existing C&I generators, our existing PWRcell storage devices and then some of our newer load management products that I talked about on the call today, we're going to make all of those, what we refer to as Enbala ready. And by doing that, in effect, we have an asset that can be much more strongly positioned with a much higher value proposition for an end user beyond -- well beyond just emergency standby in the case of our legacy products. 
And so again, I'm not answering your question directly, only because we're still kind of working through how do we want to speak to this? What is the potential? How easy or hard will it be to monetize that potential, right? And then what does that monetization look like for us specifically. So I think in the end, one thing we are convinced about is we're going to be able to sell more assets, right? I mean the assets we sell today, we're selling a lot of assets today. Primarily on the premise of emergency backup. If now those assets could be deployed as part of a virtual power plant or distributed grid and they have much more utility and value. Suddenly, you take an asset like a home standby that doesn't have a payback for a homeowner. That's not why a homeowner buys it. And you turn it into something that could provide a payback for that homeowner if the generator were to be switched on by the Enbala network by a grid operator or an energy retailer several times a year, several hours a year, for the benefit of reducing the premium they pay on the open market when there are supply demand imbalances on the grid. So it is a super exciting area for us. And more to come. More to come from us on that and really looking forward to, again, our unique position with grid services."

And those are investments, multiyear, multi tens of millions of dollars that we've been putting in that facility to ramp production there. And honestly, we came into this year, we put a bunch of automation in that facility early in the year. Even well before the pandemic hit. So we thought we were in pretty good shape. And then the demand curve has just been -- you talk about the loss of words and superlatives. Mike's running out of things in the stores here to every time we write these prepared remarks, trying to figure out how else to describe what we're seeing because it is, it's really something. And I guess while we're not quoting a distinct number, I'll just get to the heart of it. At the end of the year, I think we said in Q3 call, we said our lead times on home standby generators were between 16 to 20 weeks. So pick the midpoint on that. It's about 18 weeks is kind of where we exited the year at, if you ordered one, it was 18 weeks out. 
Today, we stand at about 20 weeks. So it's actually gone the wrong way on us. And that's -- again, we're at all-time daily records. We're hitting every day at our facility there, that Trenton facility can't come online fast enough. It's -- I wish we had a better answer for people. Our customers are really patient. I think the 1 thing that the 1 saving grace, if there is 1 here is this is a home improvement project. So people are somewhat acclimated to home improvement projects generally taking a long time. There's permitting involved, there's inspections involved. It's not just a kind of a one-and-done deal where you have something you order and then it gets shipped to your house. This is this is -- there's contractors involved and other authorities and jurisdictional authorities and things like that. So I think -- I'm not trying to say we have some cover for the longer lead times, but they get accepted to a degree. Lead times are long, but we don't see a ton of cancellations. It's a very sticky backlog. To answer your question about as compared to when we exited 2012 into 2013 after Sandy, it's orders of magnitude higher, hundreds of millions. And it's a huge number. You can do some of the back of the envelope math. If you look at our HSB kind of pacing and you kind of think about our normal lead times of 1 to 2 weeks and being out '18 at the end of the year and then that growing another 2 weeks, you can kind of model that out and probably arrive at some a range there of some thoughts around what the backlog might look like, but it's not an English word, but ginormous is one of the words we can use to describe it."

So close to the company average by the end of 2020 is the plan. And then obviously, we're going to be ramping up our operating expenses to really go fast after this market. So expecting EBITDA margins to grow throughout the year as well, along with gross margins, maybe hitting double digits there by the end of the year for EBITDA margins."

So making really good progress on the distribution front, that's your question. I think in the prepared remarks, you said like, we trained over 4,200 energy, we call them contractors.

I think in the prepared remarks, you said like, we trained over 4,200 energy, we call them contractors. We sell kind of in a multiple of ways there into the channels. We 2-step through electrical wholesalers, clean energy, electrical wholesalers, and we also sell in some cases, direct to large national partners like Sunnova, who's one of our partners, a great partner of ours. And then we serve a number of other kind of larger, independent kind of long tail energy, clean energy companies directly. So really made good progress, though, and it's been a -- I think it's -- 1 thing we learned with the home standby business is you really got to have a lot of points of light, especially in something that's growing, that's not as penetrated, right? And certainly, storage, it's a lot like the parallels there between home standby in terms of the early days of home standby 20 years ago and what storage looks like today are similar, super low penetration rate, super low awareness, pretty expensive, kind of kind of lacked kind of availability in terms of where you could access the product, market access. So we knew the road map we had to take to change that. So we've been really focused heavily on that here. And I think our sales and marketing efforts, the efforts to put together sales processes for these channel partners and pass leads to them, right? I mean 1 of their barriers to growth has always been customer acquisition costs. And here we are, given our channel partners leads for free. We're paying. And they're not free. Of course, we're spending millions and millions on advertising to drive the leads into our hands, but we're giving them to our channel partners so that they can see -- they can have success because if they have success, we have success. It's a symbiotic relationship. So again, I don't know if I'm getting to the heart of your question, but really focused on building out that distribution network."

So I think the 1 thing that we've done is we're basically going to market from a differentiated standpoint, the way we differentiate is we focus on whole home backup, whole home power capability, right? So we have the largest inverter in the industry, which allows for more to be connected to the system at any 1 point in time, right? So people we compete with have smaller inverters, and therefore, the capacity constraints that are -- that manifest as a result of that mean that you can't take everything in your home and try and run it at the same time. There's just serious limitations to that if you have a smaller invert. So one of the reasons we really like the Pike energy system is it had a very high capacity inverter. And also the battery cabinets and the battery capacity, we believe we have one of the largest capacity availabilities in the industry. So you get longer duration. Then if the outage lasts more than 4 hours, 8 hours, you start to run into trouble, but we definitely can do quite a bit with the current size of the system. So that's our -- that's how we differentiate. Are we getting our fair share? I think so. I mean, we're growing very quickly. You can look at growth rates from others who are in this industry and how they describe their own growth in Q4 in clean energy and in particular, around storage, right, if we just want to focus on that. And I would say our a 75% growth rate is best-in-class, at least for those companies that have talked about it openly. So we feel like we're making good headway. We feel like we're building the brand in the space there, adding the distribution. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we've got it. We've got a huge pipeline of really cool new stuff coming that I think is going to only continue to separate us from the pack here as the market grows."

So as you think about the business and kind of climbing that efficiency, but also where there's freely available resilient that parabolic curve, if you will. What we think about Home as a Sanctuary, it seems like we're sort of in that first order, which is I've got a rolling blackout and so -- or I've got a storm or a fire that hit. And so I don't want that to happen again. So I want to make my home more resilient. But when you think broader sort of away from the coast, and you look at the policy that's being pushed out right now in terms of the -- for decarbonization, it seems like there's a much bigger play here in terms of that that discussion along resiliency and efficiency where even these great results are kind of first inning type stuff. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that."

I mean we -- when you look at I would take our -- start with our legacy business, right, which we've been focused on for over 60 years. And it's about emergency backup. And an emergency backup system is, frankly, it's about cost, right? It's about first piece cost and what that system is capable of in terms of output, right? And so efficiency rarely, if ever, comes into the consideration, right, for a homeowner or even a business owner for that matter. It's -- what's the cost of the system? What is my potential loss during an outage and how long could I run if I needed to, right? And so the efficiency was never really a consideration. Of course, we're concerned about things like that. In fact, I might point out, one of the reasons we've been able to successfully go larger with like our air-cooled solution, as an example, we introduced the 24 KW air-cooled unit is because we did focus on efficiency, right? We looked at the internal workings of the machine itself, both at the engine and at the alternator and made some design changes that allowed us to get a more efficient connected output to convert the mechanical energy to electrical. So that was an example where it's allowed us to position with the industry's leading product line. Now thinking forward, you're right. As you think about a distributed energy network or you think of the grid 2.0 or 3.0, depending on your viewpoints on what you want to call it. I think that the new grid, this changing energy landscape, it's about a focus on decarbonizing digitizing, right, and decentralizing, right, the 3Ds of that transition and that transformation that's underway. And so efficiency does play an important role there. But that being said, I think that the ability, though, to take an asset, which was primarily viewed only in the context of resiliency. And for an emergency duty and to use it more frequently. For peak times, right? If you want to think about peak times, there is a significant benefit to that. When you think about that machine's usefulness over its life, right? So as it sits there today, a machine delivered for emergency backup only, will run a very limited amount of time in its life. That machine is fully capable of running much more. But unless it's called upon, it doesn't. And so -- but with the Enbala platform and with the idea of expanding grid services, it could be put into that type of mode. And that's an exciting advancement as we talked, on the prepared remarks and then on some of this Q&A. 
And I think we are very early in the innings in this transformation. And as I said before, I think one of the really interesting things as we look across what's going on in our business today, all the demand for home standby is about resiliency, primarily, right? And so most of those customers who are buying a home standby today are clamoring for 1 really aren't even thinking about that, that could be used in a different way. We're going to be educating people that it could. And I think that's going to open up even more opportunity and potential with the category, those existing categories, the legacy products. And that's what makes it so exciting, I think, because again, we just -- we think that the added value prop, the improved value prop of those products is going to help us sell a lot more of them. So I think that's why when you think about where this is going and our unique position as the asset manufacturer coming at this, right? I think a lot of others in this industry that we're competing against have come at it from maybe the software aspect or maybe the clean energy aspect. We're coming out from an asset production aspect, and we're saying, let's enable those assets to do a lot more because we know they can. And by the way, the majority of those assets, they're natural gas fired. So they're very clean in terms of the overall carbon footprint. So it's just -- we think it's just a really good setup."

And then the first part of your question on the connectability so we've got 2 million home Standbys in the field. I'll just focus on residential because I think it's a little bit easier to get our arms around the answer of the question. And frankly, the numbers are just big. 2 million machines that we put out in the field over the last, call it, 20, 25 years. Starting with the products in 2008, those versions of products, those are connectable through our WiFi solutions. Starting in, I think it was 2018, they began coming out of the box as standard with WiFi connectability. But the 10 years of product, the generation of product previous to that, you can buy a device from us, an accessory device to make those connectable. That represents about $1.5 million of the $2 million. Going from 2008 forward. So think about -- in terms of ease of connectability, you can still connect the previous generation products, the 500,000 are out there. It's just a little bit harder. The software and the hardware is a little more complicated. Those machines are older and that it's quite -- obviously, they've been out in the market for some time, anything pre 2008. These machines have a life cycle of 15 to 20 years. So now just taking this 1 step further, what we have on our WiFi and cellular platforms today is about 0.25 million machines that are actively talking to us every day. So I think that's pretty exciting. I mean you just look at the scale of that, 0.25 million since really, 2018, the number of machines that are out there. That's pretty meaningful. We haven't really talked about that. So it's kind of an important data point that we haven't given before. But -- and it's rapidly growing. And we have -- there's obviously subscription revenues to some of the services. We do it. Some of them are sold through our channel partners, we call them fleet subscriptions. Some of them are just consumer subscriptions. It's actually a pretty cool business. And it's growing quite nicely. But what's really important about that is those machines, those core machines for the most part, you're just talking about a software update, right? And all of those machines today, by the way, everything that's been coming out standard since 2018, you can do over-the-air updates with the firmware and software, which is awesome. So any new features like the Enbala platform, we can send it across the airwaves as an update to that equipment. So that's pretty powerful stuff. It's not unlike what you're hearing from others out there in different industries. We have that capability. We thought that, that was going to be really important for us to make sure that was in the technology road map here and the technology stack, and it is. So anyway, kind of bringing it to closure, though, there's a -- this is actively ramping. There's a lot of machines out there that we're getting data from and that we can enroll in those platforms. And then going forward, the road map we want to make Enbala standard, much the same as we made WiFi connectable technology standard in 2018, we believe that every machine by the end of this year, every home standby shipping will have it will be in Enbala ready , if you will, in store. And our storage devices as well."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to 2020 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free",3517,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to 2020 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Fourth quarter shipments, margins and profitability were all well ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was primarily due to higher shipments of home standby generators from better-than-expected production output. We're also pleased that shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the quarter. The ongoing elevated level of power outages, combined with the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend, continue to drive unprecedented levels of demand for home standby generators across the entire U.S. We continue to aggressively ramp production levels for home standby throughout the fourth quarter to all-time record daily build rates. 
Despite this expanding production, the ongoing robust demand created substantial backlog for these products at the end of the year, far exceeding anything previously experienced in the history of the product category. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased approximately 28% on a core growth basis as compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the dramatic increase in sales of home standby generators followed by the continued ramp of PWRcell energy storage systems. In addition, the higher power outage activity also drove elevated shipments of portable generators and aftermarket service parts and Chore products also improved at a strong rate as compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this significant strength was a decline in shipments of C&I products, given the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gross margin expanded 180 basis points compared to the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin increased 380 basis points over the prior year to an impressive 25.7%, which was the highest margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I wanted to provide some full year 2020 financial highlights as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. First and foremost, I want to highlight the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as I'm extremely proud of our team's efforts in responding to the crisis as we focused on maintaining our operations to the fullest extent possible. This was particularly important considering that our products and services are both essential and critical to help keep a variety of networks and infrastructure up and running, including hospitals, health care clinics, 911 call centers and wireless networks. Equally as important, we accomplished this while at the same time, implementing a wide range of preventative measures to address the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities across the world where we operate and do business. Through the tireless execution of our nearly 7,000 employees globally during 2020, Generac achieved another year of record financial results across the board as several metrics far exceeded the previous record levels seen for the full year 2019. 
Revenue grew 13% for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA coming in at $584 million, an expansion of 290 basis points to 23.5%, and we generated $427 million of free cash flow during the year. Our ability to execute on the step function increase in demand for residential products that has emerged from the new Home as a Sanctuary megatrend, was an important accomplishment during 2020. 
In addition, the building out of our clean energy market opportunity with the significant ramp in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems was a key highlight. We also expanded our product and services portfolio with the acquisitions of Energy Systems, our industrial distributor located in Northern California; and Mean Green, a leading manufacturer of an innovative line of battery-powered turf care products. 
We also made the very strategic acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, which enables our entrance into the developing market for grid services. We launched important new products during the year with the introduction of the 24-kilowatt home standby generator, the market's most powerful air-cooled unit with built-in energy monitoring. We also introduced the industry's largest rich-burn industrial natural gas generator set at 1 megawatt of output, allowing us to target new market opportunities. All of these key accomplishments as well as our execution on a number of other strategic initiatives, enabled us to make important progress on our continuing evolution to an energy technology solutions company. 
Our prior year accomplishments provide us with tremendous momentum as we head into 2021. The guidance we are initiating this morning calls for significant revenue growth of between 25% to 30%, highlighted by unprecedented home standby demand, continuing expansion of the clean energy markets and recovering C&I markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to expand to 24% to 25% for the full year 2021 despite near-term supply chain concerns related to capacity constraints, increasing cost pressures and logistics delays across the business as we enter the new year. York will provide more details on our 2021 guidance and the outlook portion of our prepared remarks today. 
Now let me provide a few more details on our accomplishments across the business for the fourth quarter and for full year 2020. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continue to be exceptionally strong during the fourth quarter. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year. Broad-based strength was experienced across the U.S. during the fourth quarter, similar to the trends seen in recent quarters, with the vast majority of states showing triple-digit growth, which we believe provides further validation for the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend. 
Activations also grew at a strong rate compared to the prior year, led by significant increases in the South Central, Southeast and Northeast regions. The power outage severity environment also continued to be quite favorable and trended well above the long-term baseline average, benefiting from a record Atlantic hurricane season, early winter storms and continued power shutoffs in California. We also ended the fourth quarter with approximately 7,300 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 dealers over the last 12 months. This includes the addition of a significant number of new dealers in California during the year as we ended 2020 with approximately 550 dealers in the state. 
Importantly, thus far, in the first quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to prior year levels. Home consultations are tracking at approximately double the prior year levels through early February. We believe this increase can be attributed to several factors that are leading to the product category becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work from home, learn from home, entertain from home and shop from home. 
With demand for home standby generators at all-time highs, we've continued to aggressively ramp our supply chain and production output, and we achieved progressively higher record daily build rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect to further expand capacity for these products with our announcement yesterday of plans to open a new manufacturing, assembly and distribution operation in Trenton, South Carolina. The facility will support increased demand for home standby generators and certain other energy technology products and serve as a distribution center to customers in the southeastern part of the country, creating approximately 450 new jobs over the next 2 years. 
The facility is expected to be operational by midyear and, once fully ramped, is projected to increase home standby capacity by approximately 75% relative to our previous normal levels as we entered 2020, with the ability to further expand the facility well beyond its current size in the future. 
Our operations teams did an amazing job during 2020, ramping production output of home standby generators to record daily build rates by the end of the year. But despite the significant increase in output, lead times for home standby generators continue to expand from the approximately 18 weeks at the end of 2020 to approximately 20 weeks today. 
 
As a result, the substantial backlog for these products continues to grow so far here in the first quarter, despite our normal seasonal low point for residential products as home consultations and orders remain very robust. 
Now I want to provide an update this morning on our rapidly expanding energy storage systems effort and recent entrance into the grid services market. We made tremendous progress during 2020 with our continuing transformation into an energy technology solutions company, as we significantly ramped deliveries of our PWRcell energy storage system and with our entry into the market for grid services through the Enbala acquisition last October. 
The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring and energy management systems remains very compelling and has considerable momentum as we head into 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the fourth quarter, as revenue for these products continued to ramp as they increased approximately 75% on a sequential basis and were a key contributor to the company's year-over-year growth. 
Overall, for 2020, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems increased significantly during the first year of commercial launch, particularly during the second half, and we're in line with our previous guidance of approximately $115 million for the full year. The tremendous growth in energy storage from essentially a start-up business was due to the important advances we have made in growing our capabilities around marketing, distribution, product development and sourcing of these products. 
We further developed and refined our targeted marketing and home consultation processes and have been very encouraged by the trends with sales leads for PWRcell systems as they continue to be strong during the fourth quarter and have increased further here in the early parts of the first quarter. 
System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, also continued to ramp notably during the fourth quarter, with this strength continuing so far through the early part of 2021. An important element of expanding our sales and marketing efforts for clean energy is the progress we continue to make building out the distribution network for these products as we trained approximately 4,200 energy storage consultants or contractors in 2020. 
We continue to receive positive feedback from our growing dealer base regarding the ease of installation, the whole home power and capacity of the PWRcell systems and the qualified sales leads being generated for them. We have continued -- also continued to advance our supply chain capabilities through increased volume and reduced system costs and achieved our first full quarter of profitability during Q4. 
We also had several important new product introductions last year, and we have a very strong pipeline of innovative new clean energy-related products that will be coming to market over the next several quarters. This includes deep integration with our legacy generator products and includes the launch later this year of a purpose-built generator solution that can be combined with a solar and storage system to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid. 
Additionally, we will be launching the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell storage system to an existing solar installation. And later in 2021, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe this system will be an industry -- will be industry-leading in terms of the technology and cost and will enable far greater control at the circuit level than is available today. When added as part of a solar and storage installation, a homeowner could effectively tailor their system to optimize for lowest cost or longest duration or some combination depending on their preferences or certain other factors. An example would be to allow the system to react to a power outage by prioritizing those loads deemed critical by a homeowner to extend the duration of their available energy storage. 
We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole house storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide the energy independence and flexibility we believe consumers really want in these systems. The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly. And we expect to see significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems are anticipated to increase substantially as we're expecting them to grow approximately 50% to 75% as compared to 2020 levels. 
Recall early in the fourth quarter that we closed on the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, a leading distributed energy resources technology company based in Denver, Colorado. Enbala's best-in-class software platform called Concerto gives utilities, grid operators and energy retailers the ability to connect and utilize distributed energy resources, also known as DERs, to help support the operational stability of the power grid, thereby enabling us to participate in the nascent and growing market opportunity for grid services. 
DER assets, which include our legacy residential and C&I generators, PWRcell energy storage systems and load management devices, can be connected to the Concerto platform and can be aggregated into a decentralized and virtual power plant network, or VPP. 
VPP provides flexible capacity to address peaks in electricity demand, variability in supply due to increasing use of renewables and when resiliency is needed as a result of power outages. While still very early in the integration process, we have made progress in developing a road map for integrating Enbala's software into our existing generator products and energy storage systems as part of an overall plan to provide a full suite of solutions for utilities, energy retailers, grid operators and end users. 
As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe the integration of Enbala's technology will enable us to not only improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products, but will also allow us to participate and develop new revenue streams in the years ahead. The solutions will be built around our products that generate, store and manage power and that can be aggregated and controlled, resulting in the potential for revenue from sales of software platforms, turnkey operation services and ultimately, performance services that can deliver megawatts of power. 
All of these efforts are targeted at enabling the equipment we provide to be connected more seamlessly as DERs in grid services applications. And in turn, improve the value proposition of these assets, which we believe will lead to increased demand for our products. 
Now shifting gears, let me provide an update on C&I. As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse impact on the overall market for global C&I power generation and related equipment given major declines in GDP growth rates around the world. While uncertainty remains around the pandemic, we are encouraged that the year-over-year revenue decline moderated as certain end markets began to show signs of recovery. As expected, shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers continued to decline significantly during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. 
As we dealt with the challenging demand environment for mobile products throughout 2020, we focused our efforts on cost reductions and other restructuring actions, which we began implementing during the second quarter of last year. As we enter 2021, we expect shipments to improve from prior year levels as national account rental customers increase their spending on fleet equipment. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products as an expected fleet replacement cycle begins and the compelling megatrend that remains intact around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could potentially benefit from economic stimulus. 
Shipments to national telecom customers increased at a significant rate during the quarter as compared to the prior year, with the magnitude of the increase pacing ahead of our prior expectations. We continue to see indications from several of our large telecom customers of an improving outlook, and we expect that to translate into very strong growth in shipments during 2021. Recall that demand trends for these customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of their capital spending and their project planning cycles. Historically, however, demand for telecom backup power tends to increase after periods of elevated power outage activity, similar to what was experienced with the outage environment during the second half of 2020. 
In addition, revenue growth during the current year is expected to benefit from the power security mandate in California, which requires a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all cell tower locations. We estimate that this new requirement in the state, which went into effect at the beginning of this year, could lead to purchases of between $100 million to $200 million in new equipment from wireless operators over the next 3 years. Also shipments to other national account customers are expected to show a considerable ramp in 2021 as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives through increasing quote activity and improving project close rates for our natural gas generators, which are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. 
Lastly, net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were lower in the quarter as expected due to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2019, which created a difficult prior year comparison. As mentioned on our last call, project quoting activity has largely recovered since the onset of the pandemic during the second quarter, contributing to a higher backlog and improved overall order outlook for this channel. And as a result, we're expecting growth to resume during 2021. We're also expecting growth from the Energy Systems business, our industrial distributor located in Northern California that we acquired on July 1 last year as our investments in integration activities begin to produce results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. 
Internationally, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a negative impact on C&I product demand during the fourth quarter as well. As GDP growth rate slowed materially around the world in 2020, revenues for our international segment in the fourth quarter declined approximately 6% on a core basis when compared to the prior year. This decline was driven by continued weakness in a number of key regions around the world. But overall international revenue during the fourth quarter was largely in line with our expectations. 
Similar to our domestic C&I products business, the international year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter was at a notably lesser rate relative to recent quarters as signs of recovery began to appear in certain regions. While COVID-19 impacts are still being felt, larger project quoting and order activity is increasing, and we expect the international segment to return to solid growth during 2021. 
Also, it's important to reiterate that our international teams remain focused on several critical global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications, expanding our share in the wireless telecom backup power segment globally and entering the emerging energy storage market for both residential and C&I applications. 
In closing this morning, in recent years, we have continued to make important progress on evolving our business model from a focus on clean energy products -- with a focus on clean energy products, solutions and services, aligned with the changing legacy electric utility model. 
In 2019, we began providing energy storage, monitoring and management systems as clean energy solutions for residential use. And last year, we entered the market for grid services involving distributed energy optimization and control software that will help support the operational stability of the power grid. We've also been focused over the last several years on connecting the legacy standby generators we manufacture, including building out a digital platform that creates tremendous value for our customers and our distribution partners over the product life cycle. As the leader in backup power solutions, we believe we are in the unique position to enable the potential utilization of these products as distributed energy resources on a very large scale, thereby providing us with a distinct advantage as the nascent market for grid services expands over the next several years. 
Going forward, we intend to further build out our capabilities as an energy technology solutions provider through organic investment and continued acquisitions. We expect to expand our energy storage capabilities beyond residential applications into C&I markets and eventually globally and further expand our capabilities with energy monitoring and management devices and grid services. These are incredibly exciting times at Generac as we've now built an incredible foundation for growth, and we have the financial flexibility to be a major player in developing the energy grid of the future. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter results and some outlook details for 2021. York?"

Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record as compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combi",2750,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record as compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2020 increased 12.7% to approximately $2.5 billion, also an all-time record for the company. 
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 54.6% to $498.7 million, as compared to $322.5 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continued to experience robust year-over-year growth, which accelerated to over 40% during the fourth quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems continue to significantly ramp during the quarter as the solar plus storage market expands at a rapid pace in the U.S., and we continue to build out our capabilities selling into this -- into the clean energy space. Also contributing to the growth were a large increase in shipments of portable generators during the quarter which benefited from the much higher power outage activity as compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, shipments of Chore products were also much higher during the quarter as the Home as a Sanctuary trend positively impacted demand for outdoor power equipment. 
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 declined 8.5% to $198.6 million as compared to $217.1 million in the prior year quarter. The weakness in shipments of C&I products was experienced both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in our national rental account customers to defer capital spending for our mobile products. And shipments to our industrial distributors also declined against a particularly strong prior year comparison. 
Partially offsetting these declines was a significant increase in shipments to national telecom account customers due to the capital spending outlook improving for these customers. Internationally, C&I products declined due to the continued weakness in demand across the majority of regions around the world as a result of the pandemic. As mentioned, while still experiencing a year-over-year sales decline during the fourth quarter, the rate of decline for C&I products continued to moderate as certain end markets begin to recover. 
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 24.4% to $63.8 million as compared to $51.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. 
In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity during the second half of the year. A larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus the prior year. 
Gross profit margin improved 180 basis points to 39.4% compared to 37.6% in the prior year fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased $11.4 million or 9.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, but declined 270 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest as defined in our earnings release, was $195.8 million or a very strong 25.7% of net sales as compared to $129.1 million or 21.9% of net sales in the prior year. This 380 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter, primarily due to the favorable sales mix, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. 
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests came in at an all-time record of $584 million, resulting in an attractive 23.5% margin or a 290 basis point increase compared to the prior year. 
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 37.2% to $645.1 million as compared to $470.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $188 million or 29.1% of net sales as compared to $122.9 million in the prior year or 26.1% of net sales. 
For the full year 2020, domestic segment sales increased 19.8% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 27%, representing a 240 basis point increase compared to the prior year. 
International segment sales, which consists primarily of C&I products, declined 4.1% to $116 million as compared to $120.9 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency had a net favorable impact of approximately 140 basis points on revenue growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $7.8 million or 6.8% of net sales as compared to $6.2 million or 5.2% of net sales in the prior year. 
For the full year 2020, International segment sales declined 14.1% over the prior year to $396 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 5.1% of net sales during 2020 compared to 5.5% of net sales in the prior year. 
Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $125 million as compared to $69.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $39 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.8% as compared to $13.4 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in pretax income in the current year, while the prior year quarter was impacted by more favorable discrete tax items, including a year-end revaluation adjustment related to a reduction in the blended state income tax rate. 
For the full year, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 22.2% compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.97 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $135.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.12 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $96.5 million in the prior year or $1.53 per share. Cash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $34.9 million as compared to $8.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects a cash income tax rate of 17.9% for the full year 2020, which is an increase from the approximately 16% rate previously expected for 2020. This also compares to the prior year rate of 15%. 
The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year was primarily due to higher pretax income, which is taxed at the higher domestic statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was robust at $218.2 million as compared to $175.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $190.7 million as compared to $160.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the current year quarter, partially offset by the lower monetization of working capital and higher capital expenditures relative to the prior year. 
Before discussing our guidance initiation for 2021, I want to make a few comments regarding our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we had nearly $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of $655 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2023. 
Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $885 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was only 1.5x on an as-reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. 
Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile, and for the full year 2020, free cash flow was easily an all-time record of $427 million as compared to $251 million in 2019, which was our previous record. Uses of cash during 2020 included $69 million for acquisitions, $62 million for capital expenditures and $25 million for the net repayment of debt. 
Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities. 
With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2021. Key demand metrics for home standby generators, including home consultations and orders, continue to trend much higher during the fourth quarter relative to prior year levels, and this strength has continued thus far in the first quarter. Due to this ongoing unprecedented demand, which has extended lead times for these products, there was a substantial backlog awards for home standby generators at the end of 2020, which has further increased thus far in the first quarter. As we expand manufacturing capacity during 2021 with a new facility coming online, we expect to further ramp production levels for home standby generators, helping to alleviate this backlog. 
In addition, the solar plus storage market is expected to experience significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as storage attachment rates continue to climb, leading to the expectation of substantial growth in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems as we continue to build out our presence in this market. Although demand for C&I products during 2020 was negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the year-over-year revenue declines continue to moderate, and shipments for these products are expected to return to growth during 2021 across a number of key end markets and geographies. 
As a result of this positive top line outlook, we are initiating guidance for 2021 that anticipate significant revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Net sales are expected to increase between 25% to 30% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes shipments of residential products increase at a very robust rate during 2021, a rate that is similar to the year-over-year growth rate experienced in 2020. Revenue for C&I products is expected to rebound at a strong rate as compared to the softer prior year comparisons, a rate approximately in the mid-teens range. 
Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages during the year in line with the long-term baseline average. However, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year such as the category 3 or higher landed hurricane. Given current capacity constraints for home standby, the upside of a major power outage event would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2021, meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage event would most likely spill over into 2022. Due to the significant home standby backlog at the end of 2020, we're expecting the quarterly seasonality in 2021 to be more level loaded relative to normal historical patterns, with sales in the first half being approximately 48% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 52% weighted. 
As a result, total year-over-year growth is forecasted to be approximately 50% for each of the first and second quarters of the year. Looking at margin profile as we enter 2021, there are near-term cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain, which are resulting in higher input costs, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs and higher wages. We expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs, to be largely offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our profit enhancement program. As a result, we expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be similar to the second half of 2020 run rate. 
In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, which is an increase from the 23.5% reported for the full year 2020. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the first half of the year to be moderately lower between 50 to 100 basis points relative to the second half of 2021, given the full realization benefit from pricing and cost reduction issues in the back half of the year. 
As is our normal practice, we are providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. For 2021, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 23.5% to 24.5% as compared to the 22.2% full year rate for 2020. This increase is driven by higher pretax income and a higher mix of domestic pretax income relative to the prior year. Based on our guidance provided for 2021, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $135 million to $140 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2021 cash income tax rate of between 20.5% to 21.5%, as compared to the 17.9% rate for the full year 2020. 
As a reminder, our approximate $30 million per year tax shield that originated from the LBO transaction in 2006 fully expires at the end of this year. As a result, 2021 is the last year that adjusted earnings will benefit from a notably lower cash income tax rate relative to our GAAP income tax rate. 
Beginning in 2022, the cash tax rate is expected to be more in line with the GAAP tax rate in the 25% to 27% range. In 2021, we expect interest expense to be approximately $34 million assuming no additional principal payments during the year and flat LIBOR rates throughout 2021. Our capital expenditures for 2021 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity, and are projected to be between 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. This CapEx guidance includes the new Trenton, South Carolina facility and related equipment that we expect to bring online during the second half of 2021. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $40 million in 2021, given our assumed capital spending guidance. 
GAAP intangible amortization expenses in 2021 is expected to be approximately $34 million to $35 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $20 million to $24 million for the year. For our full year 2021, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow, expected to be approximately 90% for the year. 
Finally, our full year diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately 64 million to 64.5 million shares. This compares to 63.7 million shares in 2020. This 2021 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions."

It's -- I mean, obviously, capacity right now, Phil, is -- we're -- as you say, we're flat out. And we're starting to see actually capacity pressures even in our C&I business, which, thankfully, we have a brand-new plant down in Mexico that we brought online last year. We haven't talked a ton about it, but it's a beautiful facility. It's primarily there to serve the Latin American market, consolidation of our previous operations down in Mexico City. But we can use that facility as well for other things, and we'll probably end up doing some products for the U.S. and Canada down there simply just because we're going to be up against some capacity things here, too, especially in the smaller C&I ranges for telecom. The telecom business is looking like it's -- the lineup there is pretty strong relative to demand. 
But on the -- back on the home standby side, yes, the new facility in Trenton is going to be a big boost. You're right. The 75% improvement that we say or increase that we've been indicating in capacity was off of the previous capacity limitations as we entered 2020. So we did raise those numbers over the course of 2020. So in effect, with that new facility coming online, we can get more capacity. And then that site is actually expandable about 2, 2.5x its existing size today if we choose to go that route. So to answer your question, when do we see catching this? We're going to be working hard all year-long to do that. 
Remember, recall that we do have some temporary production that we stood up in one of our other facilities here in Wisconsin. The initial plan was to take that down as we ramped up the Trenton facility over the summer. We could choose to leave -- if demand remains strong and every indication right now is that, that will be the case, we could leave that temporary capacity add online, which gives us kind of an incremental bump above where kind of we would be if it was just Whitewater and Trenton. So -- but the way we've sized the equipment and everything in the Trenton facility, we think we'll be ramping throughout the full year and we'll kind of hit the ground running here midyear and hopefully be at kind of max rates by the end of the year. That would be the goal."

Lots of interest in the call. Well, anyway, I'll get to the questions here. So I wanted to talk about some of the demand dynamics you've seen around the Home as a Sanctuary theme. Have you discerned anything different in terms of the demographics or anything you pick up on the types of customers whose leads you're qualifying or maybe through channel conversations? You've commented that it's a much broader swell of demand geographically, so many more states, for example. So that -- so it's clear that that's changed. I just wonder, for years and years, you've had a pretty good insight into the types of folks who are interested in your products demographic-wise. And I just wonder if you're seeing any shifts there as a part of this trend."

The -- we do a ton of work around the demographics of the customer bases that buy those products over the years. It's just as the leader in that category and as building it out, we had to develop the market. So understanding who the buyer was and where the opportunities were. And frankly, one of the things we learned in that is understanding who the buyer wasn't, right? So who wasn't buying the products and why? Who went through the sale process and didn't buy and why didn't they buy? Those are all important considerations. And to answer your question, though, demographically -- typically, the product category historically is skewed older, right? So something on the order of 70% of the customers have been over age 50 historically. And that's really because homeownership kind of follows those trends. 
We have seen indications early in the pandemic what we saw and it's a little bit dicey when we talk about this because you have to talk about that expansion in the geography. As an example, Florida was such a hot market last year for us and it's just typically demographically is an older market. So we actually saw our demo shift older. But when you strip out Florida, actually, the demo for other states was shifting younger, which is really fascinating. And I think what it speaks to, Florida was an interesting dynamic because you had a lot of people who went down over the winter last year. The pandemic started to take hold February and March. They chose to kind of shelter in place and stay in Florida. 
If they didn't own a generator, they came to the conclusion very quickly, they needed 1, because they were going to be basically stuck in Florida, and they would start to get worried about something that if you're not living there, you don't worry about over the summer, which is the hurricane season. So we saw marked interest in Florida by that market, and that led to kind of a skew towards older. But everywhere else, it was younger. And so what we're seeing is younger families, in particular, people who are moving out of cities, metro areas and into homes. And again, they're working from home now, in particular. They're not driving back into the city to go into an office. They're staying in their home. 
And so they start to connect the dots, and maybe they experience their first or their first outage in their new home, and they figure out very quickly just how vulnerable they are. And so you hear us use this term power security we started introducing in the terminology here. And it's not an unfamiliar term for those around the industry. But this idea of making sure that you've got a continuous source of power to protect your home, your family, your livelihood is -- I think is really resonating across -- certainly across geographies as we talked. But demographically, I think it's resonating, in particular, with people who are shifting to that work from home model and learn from home model."

And specifically, you made some comments around the potential to enroll natural gas generators whether they be on the resi or the C&I side into that kind of platform. What does the potential ramp there look like here in North America? Maybe because you have such great market share on the resi side, not many others have talked about that concept, but it sounds like you have some product innovation in the pipeline that may enable it. And so I'm curious what the opportunity set looks like."

It's something that as part of the thesis behind the acquisition of Enbala was that, obviously, we make a lot of products that could be used as distributed energy resources, right?

It's something that as part of the thesis behind the acquisition of Enbala was that, obviously, we make a lot of products that could be used as distributed energy resources, right? So we have 2 million home standby generators on the ground. We have literally hundreds of megawatts of C&I product that we put in the market every year. It's actually -- if you step back and you think of the potential and it's -- I called it out in the prepared remarks. We think we're in this incredibly unique position, given the scale that we can bring to this with the assets that we already -- not only that we already have on the ground, but certainly that we put into the market on a year in and year out basis. And those assets, combined now with the technology, which is Enbala, I can share the platform is the enablement of those assets to be used in a much more fulsome way, right, to the benefit of the end users, grid operators, utility companies, ourselves, right, Generac. I mean there's an opportunity for us to participate in that. 
We haven't given really clear kind of longer-range guidance on this yet, because we're trying to get our arms around just what are the different business models that are out there and available to us, and there are a lot of them. I talked about a few of them in the script here today. But there's a lot of different ways we could play this. I think the opportunity doesn't begin, though, until we get the products to be connected to the Enbala network. And that's what our effort is here in the early innings. So we just closed on this acquisition in really the beginning of Q4 in October. So we've been diligently working on our road maps to make sure we can take our existing residential generators, our existing C&I generators, our existing PWRcell storage devices and then some of our newer load management products that I talked about on the call today. 
We're going to make all of those what we refer to as Enbala ready. And by doing that, in effect, we have an asset that can be much more strongly positioned with a much higher value proposition for an end user beyond -- well beyond just emergency standby in the case of our legacy products. And so again, I'm not answering your question directly, only because we're still kind of working through how do we want to speak to this? What is the potential? How easy or hard will it be to monetize that potential, right? And then what does that monetization look like for us specifically. 
So I think in the end, one thing we are convinced about is we're going to be able to sell more assets, right? I mean the assets we sell today, we're selling a lot of assets today, primarily on the premise of emergency backup. If now those assets could be deployed as part of a virtual power plant or distributed grid and they have much more utility and value, suddenly, you take an asset like a home standby that doesn't have a payback for a homeowner. That's not why a homeowner buys it. And you turn it into something that could provide a payback for that homeowner if the generator were to be switched on by the Enbala network by a grid operator or an energy retailer several times a year, several hours a year, for the benefit of reducing the premium they pay on the open market when there are supply-demand imbalances on the grid. So it is a super exciting area for us and more to come, more to come from us on that and really looking forward to, again, our unique position with grid services."

We have been making some major investments in our Whitewater facility, where -- which has been the primary center of gravity for manufacturing of those products. And those are investments, multiyear -- multi tens of millions of dollars that we've been putting in that facility to ramp production there. And honestly, we came into this year. We put a bunch of automation in that facility early in the year, even well before the pandemic hit. So we thought we were in pretty good shape. And then the demand curve has just been -- you talk about the loss of words and superlatives. Mike's running out of things in the stores here to -- every time we write these prepared remarks trying to figure out how else to describe what we're seeing because it's really something. 
And I guess while we're not quoting a distinct number, I'll just get to the heart of it. At the end of the year, I think we said -- in Q3 call, we said our lead times on home standby generators were between 16 to 20 weeks. So pick the midpoint on that. So about 18 weeks is kind of where we exited the year at, if you ordered one. It was 18 weeks out. Today, we stand at about 20 weeks. So it's actually gone the wrong way on us. And that's -- again, we're at all-time daily records we're hitting every day at our facility there. That Trenton facility can't come online fast enough. It's -- I wish we had a better answer for people. Our customers are really patient. 
I think the 1 thing that -- the 1 saving grace, if there is 1 here is this is a home improvement project. So people are somewhat acclimated to home improvement projects generally taking a long time. There's permitting involved. There's inspections involved. It's not just a kind of a one-and-done deal where you have something you order and then it gets shipped to your house. This is -- there's contractors involved and other authorities and jurisdictional authorities and things like that. So I think -- I'm not trying to say we have some cover for the longer lead times, but they get accepted to a degree. Lead times are long, but we don't see a ton of cancellations. It's a very sticky backlog. 
To answer your question about as compared to when we exited 2012 into 2013 after Sandy, it's orders of magnitude higher, hundreds of millions. And it's a huge number. You can do some of the back of the envelope math. If you look at our HSB kind of pacing in Q4 and you kind of think about our normal lead times of 1 to 2 weeks and being out 18 at the end of the year and then that growing another 2 weeks. You can kind of model that out and probably arrive at some -- a range there of some thoughts around what the backlog might look like, but it's not an English word, but ginormous is one of the words we can use to describe it."

And then we serve a number of other kind of larger, independent kind of long tail energy -- clean energy companies directly. So really made good progress, though. And it's been a -- I think it's -- 1 thing we learned with the home standby business is you really got to have a lot of points of light, especially in something that's growing, that's not as penetrated, right? And certainly, storage, it's a lot like the parallels there between home standby in terms of the early days of home standby 20 years ago and what storage looks like today are early similar. 
Super low penetration rate, super low awareness, pretty expensive, kind of lacked kind of availability in terms of where you could access the product, market access.

So people we compete with have smaller inverters, and therefore, the capacity constraints that are -- that manifest as a result of that mean that you can't take everything in your home and try and run it at the same time. There's just serious limitations to that if you have a smaller inverter. So one of the reasons we really like the Pika Energy system is it had a very high capacity inverter. And also the battery cabinets and the battery capacity -- we believe we have one of the largest capacity availabilities in the industry. 
So you get longer duration. Then if the outage lasts more than 4 hours, 8 hours, you start to run into trouble, but we definitely can do quite a bit with the current size of the system. So that's our -- that's how we differentiate. Are we getting our fair share? I think so. I mean, we're growing very quickly. You can look at growth rates from others who are in this industry, how they describe their own growth in Q4 in clean energy and in particular around storage, right, if we just want to focus on that. And I would say our 75% growth rate is best-in-class, at least for those companies that have talked about it openly. So we feel like we're making good headway. We feel like we're building the brand in the space there, adding the distribution. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we've got a huge pipeline of really cool new stuff coming that I think is going to only continue to separate us from the pack here as the market grows."

Great job all the way around. So Aaron, just if I think about resiliency and efficiency, I think, most people and investors tend to think, well, both are positives, but many don't realize that you're diametrically opposed between resiliency and efficiency. So as you think about the business and kind of climbing that efficiency, but also where there's freely available resilient -- that parabolic curve, if you will. If we think about Home as a Sanctuary, it seems like we're sort of in that first order, which is I've got a rolling blackout and so -- or I've got a storm or a fire that hit. And so I don't want that to happen again. So I want to make my home more resilient. But when you think broader sort of away from the coast, and you look at the policy that's being pushed out right now in terms of the -- for decarbonization, it seems like there's a much bigger play here in terms of that discussion along resiliency and efficiency where even these great results are kind of first inning type stuff. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that."

And an emergency backup system is -- frankly, it's about cost",715,"Yes, absolutely, Jed. I mean we -- when you look at -- I would take our -- start with our legacy business, right, which we've been focused on for over 60 years. And it's about emergency backup. And an emergency backup system is -- frankly, it's about cost, right? It's about first piece cost and what that system is capable of in terms of output, right? And so efficiency rarely, if ever, comes into the consideration, right, for a homeowner or even a business owner for that matter. It's -- what's the cost of the system? What is my potential loss during an outage and how long could I run if I needed to, right? And so the efficiency was never really a consideration. Of course, we're concerned about things like that. In fact, I might point out. One of the reasons we've been able to successively go larger with like our air-cooled solution, as an example, we introduced the 24 kW air-cooled unit, is because we did focus on efficiency, right? 
We looked at the internal workings of the machine itself, both at the engine and at the alternator and made some design changes that allowed us to get a more efficient connected output to convert the mechanical energy to electrical. So that was an example where it's allowed us to position with the industry's leading product line. Now thinking forward, you're right. As you think about a distributed energy network or you think of the Grid 2.0 or 3.0, depending on your viewpoints on what you want to call it, I think that the new grid, this changing energy landscape, it's about a focus on decarbonizing, digitizing, right, and decentralizing, right, the 3Ds of that transition and that transformation that's underway. And so efficiency does play an important role there. 
But that being said, I think that the ability, though, to take an asset, which was primarily viewed only in the context of resiliency and for an emergency duty and to use it more frequently for peak times, right? If you want to think about peak times, there is a significant benefit to that when you think about that machine's usefulness over its life, right? So as it sits there today, a machine delivered for emergency backup only, will run a very limited amount of time in its life. That machine is fully capable of running much more. But unless it's called upon, it doesn't. And so -- but with the Enbala platform and with the idea of expanding grid services, it could be put into that type of mode. And that's an exciting advancement as we talked on the prepared remarks and then on some of this Q&A. 
And I think we are very early in the innings in this transformation. And as I said before, I think one of the really interesting things as we look across what's going on in our business today. All the demand for home standby is about resiliency, primarily, right? And so most of those customers who are buying a home standby today are clamoring for 1 really aren't even thinking about that, that could be used in a different way. We're going to be educating people that it could. And I think that's going to open up even more opportunity and potential with the category, those existing categories, the legacy products. And that's what makes it so exciting, I think, because again, we just -- we think that the added value prop, the improved value prop of those products is going to help us sell a lot more of them. 
So I think that's why when you think about where this is going and our unique position as the asset manufacturer coming at this, right? I think a lot of others in this industry that we're competing against have come at it from maybe the software aspect or maybe the clean energy aspect. We're coming at it from an asset production aspect. And we're saying, let's enable those assets to do a lot more because we know they can. And by the way, the majority of those assets, they're natural gas fired. So they're very clean in terms of the overall carbon footprint. So it's just -- we think it's just a really good setup."

And then the first part of your question on the connectability. So we've got 2 million home standbys in the field. I'll just focus on residential because I think it's a little bit easier to get our arms around the answer of the question. And frankly, the numbers are just big. 2 million machines that we put out in the field over the last, call it, 20, 25 years. Starting with the products in 2008, those versions of products, those are connectable through our WiFi solutions. Starting in, I think it was 2018, they began coming out of the box as standard with WiFi connectability. But the 10 years of product -- the generation of product previous to that, you can buy a device from us, an accessory device to make those connectable. That represents about 1.5 million of the 2 million going from 2008 forward. So think about -- in terms of ease of connectability, you can still connect the previous generation products, the 500,000 are out there. 
It's just a little bit harder. The software and the hardware is a little more complicated. Those machines are older and that it's quite -- obviously, they've been out in the market for some time, anything pre 2008. These machines have a life cycle of 15 to 20 years. So now just taking this 1 step further, what we have on our WiFi and cellular platforms today is about 0.25 million machines that are actively talking to us every day. So I think that's pretty exciting. I mean you just look at the scale of that, 0.25 million since really, 2018, the number of machines that are out there. That's pretty meaningful. We haven't really talked about that. So that's kind of an important data point that we haven't given before. 
But -- and it's rapidly growing. And we have -- there's obviously subscription revenues to some of the services. We do it. Some of them are sold through our channel partners. We call them fleet subscriptions. Some of them are just consumer subscriptions. It's actually a pretty cool business. And it's growing quite nicely. But what's really important about that is those machines -- those, call it, earlier machines for the most part, you're just talking about a software update, right? And all of those machines today, by the way, everything that's been coming out standard since 2018, you can do over-the-air updates with the firmware and software, which is awesome. So any new features like the Enbala platform, we can send it across the airwaves as an update to that equipment. So that's pretty powerful stuff. 
It's not unlike what you're hearing from others out there in different industries. We have that capability. We thought that, that was going to be really important for us to make sure that was in the technology road map here and the technology stack, and it is. So anyway, kind of, bringing it to closure, though. There's a -- this is actively ramping. There's a lot of machines out there that we're getting data from and that we can enroll in those platforms. And then going forward, the road map we want to make Enbala standard, much the same as we made WiFi connectable technology standard in 2018. We believe that every machine by the end of this year, every home standby shipping we'll have, it will be Enbala ready, if you will."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were incredibly strong as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all-time records for Generac, despite Q1 historically being the low point for",2839,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Our first quarter results were incredibly strong as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all-time records for Generac, despite Q1 historically being the low point for the year seasonally for our business. First quarter revenue margins and profitability were all significantly ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was very broad-based and was heightened -- highlighted by increased shipments of residential products, primarily due to home standby and portable generators. 
Home standby build rates were ahead of plan for the quarter, and demand further accelerated due to continuing traction with the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend as well as being driven by significantly higher power outage activity in recent quarters, including the major event in Texas, which also led to a sharp increase in demand for portable generators. 
Revenue from C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter domestically with our industrial distributors, national telecom customers and rental customers as well as internationally, mostly in the European region. 
Also in terms of profitability, adjusted EBITDA margin came in considerably higher than our previous forecast, driven mostly by greater operating leverage from the significantly higher revenue achieved during the quarter. 
Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 70% to $807 million and also increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020, which was our previous all-time record. Growth in the quarter was broad-based, led by a dramatic increase for residential products that more than doubled compared to prior year as shipments for home standby generators were much higher due to record production levels. 
Shipments of portable generators also increased driven by the major outage event in Texas and higher outage activity overall in recent quarters. Deliveries of Chore products and clean energy products, such as our PWRcell energy storage system, also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and shipments of C&I products returned to strong growth in the quarter. 
Gross margin expanded 370 basis points compared to prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 840 basis points over the prior first quarter to 26.5%, which was the highest EBITDA margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the major outage event that occurred in Texas in mid-February. This was a very unique winter event with unusually cold weather in a state that represents our second largest addressable market opportunity for home standby generators and highlighted yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current electrical utility model. This was a high-profile power outage. In fact, the fifth largest event recorded since we began tracking outages more than a decade ago, with rolling blackouts across the state that lasted for several days and impacted over 4.5 million utility customers at its peak. 
With the backdrop of the ongoing Home as a Sanctuary trend, we believe the outage in Texas was a dramatic reminder of the pain of losing power in today's day and age and further amplify the importance of having power security for your home or your business. Driven by this event, we experienced yet another dramatic acceleration in demand for home standby generators from the already elevated levels, increasing our lead times to approximately 28 weeks for our most popular models as of today. 
As a result, we have further increased our capacity expansion plans for home standby as we target even higher production levels in the second half of the year through a faster ramp of our New South Carolina facility and further expansion of capacity at our Wisconsin facilities. When combined with the broad-based strengthening of demand across the rest of our business, including a significant recovery in C&I products, which are also benefiting from the major Texas event, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. We'll provide additional details regarding our updated guidance and the outlook portion of our prepared remarks this morning. 
Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continue to be exceptionally strong and rose even further during the first quarter benefiting from the major event in Texas. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year, with year-over-year appointments more than 5x higher during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The strength was broad-based across the U.S., with the vast majority of states showing triple-digit growth once again which we believe provides further validation of the need for backup power given the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend. 
Activations, which are a proxy for installations, grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year and were also broad-based in strength across all U.S. regions. The power outage severity environment continues to be very active during the quarter and trended well above the long-term baseline average, driven by the Texas event, but also ice storms in several states, severe storms in the Pacific Northwest, outage events in California and smaller scale rolling blackouts in other states due to severe cold temperatures. 
In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the first quarter with approximately 7,700 residential dealers, a sequential increase of about 400 new dealers as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately 1,200 dealers higher over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas. 
Early here in the second quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to last year as home consultations are running more than double the prior year's level through April. We continue to believe that the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work more from home, learn from home, entertain from home and shop from home. 
Now I want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring and energy management remains very compelling and has gained further momentum so far here in 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and demand paced ahead of our expectations during the first quarter. 
In addition to the strong demand, key performance indicators for our clean energy-related initiatives continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations grew rapidly as compared to the prior year and were very encouraging sequentially as compared to the fourth quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, also grew at a tremendous rate during the first quarter as compared to prior year, and orders for clean energy products were very strong on a sequential basis during the first quarter, and this strength has continued here in April. 
We also have had encouraging success further building out our installer network as we've trained and certified approximately 2,000 dealers as of the end of the quarter, with approximately 800 dealers registered on our Powerplay CE selling system. 
As we discussed during the last earnings call, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products, which are expected to come to market throughout the current year. New product launches include deep integration of our PWRcell storage systems with our legacy generator products, the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell system to an existing solar installation and the launch of a new purpose-built generator that can be combined with solar and storage to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid. 
Additionally, later this year, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PowerView energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole home storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide both the energy independence and flexibility that we believe consumers really want in these types of systems. 
The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly within the U.S., and we are making good progress in building considerable momentum for our energy storage products. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year revenue outlook as a result of higher demand and our expanded distribution in this growing market. We now expect shipments of clean energy products to increase between 75% to 100% as compared to the prior year levels of approximately $115 million, which is an increase from the previous forecast of 50% to 75% growth. 
In addition, we achieved the second consecutive quarter of profitability for clean energy products during the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue sequentially for the remainder of the year as we further scale PWRcell system volumes. 
Recall that in October of last year, we acquired Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider, and I'd like to provide a quick update on the progress we're making in developing a road map for integrating Enbala's software platform into our existing generator and energy storage products. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe integrating Enbala's technology will allow us -- will enable us to improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products as well as allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will include the existing software as a service platform that Enbala offers as well as a variety of operational services that enable a more turnkey solution and, ultimately, performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers. 
During the first quarter, we began marketing our initial solutions, which involve our legacy products delivered with built-in capabilities to connect to the Enbala platform. These Enbala generic assets, known as distributed energy resources, or DERs can be available to bundle together to form a virtual power plant or VPP solution. We're excited to currently offer this initial capability with our C&I natural gas generators and, as the year progresses, we will begin to introduce this feature with our home standby generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems. 
Also, over the last several quarters, the Enbala and Generac commercial sales teams have been working closely together on potential projects with utilities, energy cooperatives and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities during the first quarter. 
In addition to the great performance of residential products to start the year, C&I products were also very strong as revenue returned to growth during the first quarter and increased at a strong rate compared to the prior year broadly across a number of markets and geographies as demand continues to recover at a faster pace than we had previously expected. 
Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel returned to solid growth in the quarter, with project quoting activity continuing to recover from the beginning of the pandemic last year and once again growing at a solid rate as compared to 2019 levels. This is leading to an improved overall order outlook for the sales channel and, as a result, we're expecting attractive growth during the year. 
We also are expecting solid growth from the Energy Systems business. This is our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last July, as our investments in integration activities are producing results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. 
Shipments to telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year, and we're well ahead of our expectations. Several of our larger telecom customers have materially raised their capital spending outlook for the year leading us to now expect a substantial increase in telecom shipments during the current year relative to our prior forecast. 
The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical can be attributed to a number of factors, including the elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' next-generation networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications networks as this infrastructure shifts to the next-generation 5G architecture. 
Additionally, we gained further traction in the quarter with our lead gas initiatives through increased quote activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators that are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. This is an emerging part of our C&I business that already had good momentum entering the year. And the major outages in Texas have created additional demand for these products. 
Shipments of mobile products to national account rental customers were lower during the first quarter, but exceeded our previous expectations as the rate of decline slowed relative to recent quarters, and we expect a return to growth for these products during the second quarter. As we mentioned during our last call, we expected shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve from prior year levels as national rental account customers increased their spending on fleet equipment due to improving utilization and rental rates. 
Several of our large national rental customers have recently increased their capital spending plans even further. And as a result, we're increasing our outlook for these products as it appears a fleet replacement cycle has begun. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products with the compelling megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans recently announced by the current administration. 
Outside of North America, we returned to growth during the first quarter with revenue increasing at a solid core rate of 10% compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in the European region that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. While COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still being felt in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, leading to a significant increase in our international backlog at the end of the first quarter. As a result, our revenue outlook for the international segment has further improved as we now expect strong growth for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin expected to expand considerably year-over-year, benefiting from improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes. 
Lastly, our international teams continue to make encouraging progress on several important global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications and expanding our share in the market for telecom backup power in key regions around the world. 
In closing this morning, 2021 is developing into a year where our megatrends and macular secular themes -- macro secular themes appear to have significant momentum and are moving in the same direction as we anticipated as we are anticipating tremendous growth for our residential products and a significant rebound in demand for C&I products as compared to the prior year. 
A key focus for our teams is expanding capacity across the business, both within our own facilities as well as ramping our supply chain to enable our ability to continue to scale. Our operations and supply chain teams have been working aggressively to address ongoing sourcing and logistics delays, component availability constraints and the increasing cost pressures we have been experiencing. We have largely mitigated the impact of these issues up to this point, but the situation remains fluid. That being said, we believe we have appropriately risk-adjusted our latest guidance to reflect potential disruptions and additional inflationary pressures that will likely continue to materialize as the year progresses. 
Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to our more than 7,000 employees at Generac that have helped us successfully navigate the pandemic while still providing an incredible level of service to our customers and our partners around the world. The hyperscale growth that we are experiencing is a reflection of their commitment to the execution of our strategy and their dedication to our success. 
When you combine the strength of our team, with our financial strength, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to aggressively invest in a number of strategic initiatives to further accelerate our strategy and build out our capabilities as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2021. York?"

Looking at first quarter 2021 results in more detail.

The combination of contribu",2450,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 70% to $807.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $475.9 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 3% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. 
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales more than doubled to $542.1 million as compared to $257.6 million in the prior year, representing a 110% increase. Also, residential products improved 9% on a sequential basis as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, benefiting from the significant backlog for home standby generators entering 2021, which is in contrast to the normal seasonally lower volumes experienced during the first quarter that have averaged a 26% sequential decline over the past 5 years. 
As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which more than doubled during the first quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. 
Portable generators also experienced dramatic growth versus the prior year due to the much higher power outage activity, highlighted by the impact from the major event in Texas. 
In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, as the solar plus storage market in the U.S. continues to expand and as we build out our capabilities selling into the clean energy space. 
Lastly, shipments of Chore products were also much higher during the quarter, in part due to the Home as a Sanctuary trend continuing to positively impact demand for outdoor power equipment. 
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2021 increased 18% to $202.4 million as compared to $172.1 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a return to growth for C&I products for the first time since the third quarter of 2019, with the previous 4 quarters being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The strength in shipments was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, both domestically and internationally in the following areas. 
Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers due to capital spending, further improving for these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives. 
Internationally, the increase in C&I products, as previously mentioned, was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European region, that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, which began during the first quarter of last year. 
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring, subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 36% to $62.9 million as compared to $46.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. 
In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity in recent quarters. A larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus prior year. 
Gross profit margin improved 370 basis points to 39.9% compared to 36.2% in the prior year first quarter. Operating expenses increased $23.2 million or 21.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2020, but declined 610 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter. 
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $214.2 million or a very strong 26.5% of net sales as compared to $86 million or 18.1% of net sales in the prior year. This substantial 840 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter due to favorable sales mix, improved pricing and favorable overhead absorption, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. 
Note, the favorable impact to margins during the first quarter were partially offset by the onset of higher input costs, primarily relating to higher commodities, currencies, labor, freight and logistics costs, and these are expected to have more of an impact on properly starting in the second quarter. 
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased a robust 84% to $693 million as compared to $376 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $207.1 million, representing a very healthy 30% margin as compared to $82.8 million in the prior year or 22% of net sales. 
International segment sales increased 15% to $115 million as compared to $100 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of currency, increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $7.1 million or 6.2% of net sales as compared to $3.3 million or 3.3% of net sales in the prior year. 
Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $149 million as compared to $44.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $35.4 million or an effective tax rate of 19.1% as compared to $9.4 million or an effective tax rate of 17.9% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in the mix of domestic pretax income in the current year, which is taxed at an approximate 25% statutory rate. 
Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.33 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.68 in the prior year. 
Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $152.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.38 per share, which is also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $55.1 million in the prior year or $0.87 per share. 
Cash income taxes for the first quarter of 2021 were $37.9 million as compared to $7.3 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20.5% for the full year 2021, which is at the lower end of the previously expected range of 20.5% to 21.5% for 2021. This compares to the prior year rate of 14% that was anticipated in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate. 
Cash flow from operations was robust at $152.5 million as compared to $11.3 million in the prior year first quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $125.8 million as compared to a negative $1 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented seasonal records for the first quarter of a year. The substantial increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher net income and a lower level of working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher capital expenditures, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. 
Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I wanted to comment briefly on our healthy liquidity position at the end of the first quarter of '21, which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy. 
As of March 31, 2021, we had over $1 billion of liquidity comprised of $745 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $872 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was only 1.2x on an as reported basis. 
In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. 
We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months of $554 million. 
I'd now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for the full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. The major outages in Texas have led to an acceleration in demand and backlog for home standby generators. And as a result, our operations team has further increased their capacity expansion plans, and this is leading to a significant increase in the shipment outlook for these products for the full year 2021. 
The Texas outages also had a notable impact on portable generator shipments and, with an active sell-through at retail, we are increasing our outlook for these products as well. Also contributing to the improved outlook is higher demand for our PWRcell energy storage systems as we continue to make further progress in building our distribution partners in the clean energy market. 
The outlook for C&I products has also improved considerably with a significant pick up demand for telecom national account customers, stronger outlook for domestic industrial distributors, traction with certain projects and beyond standby applications, a further recovery in demand for mobile products and an improved outlook for C&I products within the international markets. 
As a result of these incrementally positive end market trends, we are increasing our full year 2020 net sales guidance to now be approximately 40% to 45% growth compared to the prior year, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous as reported guidance of 25% to 30%. At the midpoint of the range, this updated sales growth guidance would result in a year-over-year increase in net sales of over $1 billion. This revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increased at a very robust rate of over 50% as compared to the prior year. 
Revenue for C&I products is now expected to rebound at an even stronger rate as compared to the softer prior year comparison, a rate approximately in the mid-20% range. 
Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages in line with the longer-term baseline average for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year. 
Given the additional capacity expansion for home standby generators that is targeted to increase as the year progresses, we are now expecting the seasonality for revenue in 2021 to be a bit more weighted towards the second half of the year, with sales in the first half being approximately 47% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 53% weighted. 
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021. As we've discussed, there continues to be significant cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain, which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs and higher wages. Furthermore, we still expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs, to be offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our profit enhancement program. 
As a result, we expect gross margins for the full year 2021 to expand approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year. 
In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. However, due to the much higher anticipated sales volumes, we should experience improved leverage on our operating expenses relative to previous guidance. 
As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25.5%, which is an increase from the 24% to 25% previously expected and an expansion from the 23.5% margin in the prior year. 
From a seasonality perspective, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the second and third quarters to be moderately lower relative to the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of rising input costs. However, we believe this impact will be temporary, with adjusted EBITDA margins forecasted to improve in the fourth quarter back to first quarter levels, as the rising cost pressures are anticipated to be offset by more favorable mix, additional pricing and cost reduction initiatives that are expected to be realized towards the end of the year. 
Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year '21 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5%, which is slightly lower as compared to the 23.5% to 24.5% previously expected. 
Our capital expenditures for 2021 as a percentage of forecasted net sales are still projected to be in the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3%, although with a much higher revenue outlook, this represents an increase in absolute dollar investment compared to our prior expectations, primarily due to additional capacity expansion. The remaining guidance items provided in our previous earnings call are not expected to change. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

On Enbala, I think our confidence grows daily with that acquisition. It just continues to reinforce our strategic direction around participating more fully in the shift to Grid 2.0, right? I mean that's really what that ac",580,"Sure. No, good questions, Tommy. On Enbala, I think our confidence grows daily with that acquisition. It just continues to reinforce our strategic direction around participating more fully in the shift to Grid 2.0, right? I mean that's really what that acquisition was about. It really was about helping us take our legacy assets, our generators, if you will, as well as our clean energy assets like PWRcell and our load management devices and really expose those distributed energy resources for the benefit of grid operators, utilities, energy aggregators and ultimately the end customers, the owner operators of those pieces of equipment. 
What I can say over the last quarter is we continue to dive pretty deep into the pipeline that Enbala had previous to our acquisition. It is substantially larger today than it was, that pipeline -- substantially larger today than it was when we acquired it. We believe there are a couple of reasons for this. One, during the acquisition, of course, that was -- COVID was -- we were in the middle of that, and there was some retrenchment by utilities and others on a lot of things. But certainly, programs like grid services were kind of put down -- they were set down and as they were working on other things. But the volumes have picked up dramatically here based on the fact that COVID has abated. But probably more importantly, many of these customers are telling us that they feel like now they get that Enbala has a partner in Generac that is, one, financially stable and, two, has access to all these wonderful assets, right? 
So what Enbala was selling before was software, and it's agnostic software to the OEM and agnostic to even the type of DER, be it storage or be it a generating asset, but -- and we want to maintain that because we think that's important. But I think having the opportunity to provide a full turnkey solution to a utility is really important. It really reduces the friction around which platform should the utility choose, if our assets deeply integrate with it, and they have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute in our financial wherewithal to be able to do that. What we believe that's led to is just a lot more opportunities that we're seeing. So really good things to see there. 
On the product pipeline, you mentioned the -- we keep calling it this purpose-built generator. This is really our off-grid generator, if you will. It's a machine that will produce direct current power. So it will be able to charge a battery. It won't provide power to your home during a blackout, but it will be able to provide power to your battery as you deplete the battery, which could be during a blackout or some other time. We think that's a really important kind of critical missing link for those homeowners that really want to defect from the grid. And so think of it as a grid defection enabler. That product will be available later this year. And we're pretty excited about it. We've got a lot of interest in it. We'll see how many people really want to truly defect from the grid. They'll be able to do that after this product hits the market, but it's going to be an exciting launch. We're going to launch it at SPI here in September. So it should be a lot of fun."

And this is where I'll give a huge shout-out to our operations teams are. It's a fight every day, every hour. I mean they literally have hour by hour kind of metrics that they're pacing against, not only obviously for output, but the ability to hit the kinds of output levels that we're achieving and do it safely and to continue to produce a quality product. These are top of mind for everything we do. It's just -- it's amazing. In full disclosure, I think if you had asked me as the CEO of this company even 6 months ago, if we'd be able to achieve the levels we are at today in the existing footprint, I would have probably taken the under on that bet. I just -- I'm maybe more of a realist at heart and maybe just would have -- you never want to bet against your own team. But these these folks on our team just continue to outperform. They're working very closely with our supply chain. That's obviously a major component of this to make sure we get continuous supply. 
We've been expanding our supply chain to dual and triple source, which has been incredibly helpful. That was an initiative we actually started back a couple of years ago now, but it's paying off very handsomely. We invested very heavily in automation over the last several years, which is also paying off quite nicely. And really, the way the teams -- to answer your question at the root of it, is the teams are continually looking at ways to improve the operations of the business. So how do we -- squeezing out 0.5 point of efficiency or 0.25 point of productivity out of our equipment, out of our teams, out of our supply chain makes a big difference at the kinds of rates that we're running right now. 
Again, we don't know what the future holds. Supply chain is just a really challenging area right now, everything from logistics to component availability. Everybody's talking about this. And we're no different. We have taken a pretty, I would say, I think we've properly reflected that in the guidance. We'll just say that. I think we kind of handicapped it in a way that we believe these numbers that we're going to put out are achievable based on everything we know today. 
If we have some improvement in the supply chain situation, maybe they go higher. We'll see. But I'm just -- I'm incredibly proud of the team. They're just -- they're doing a great job. And really, I can't say more about it."

So we're effectively -- we are going to double our capacity. Where we're at today is somewhat kind of double where we were running maybe a little more than a year ago, maybe 12 to 18 months ago. And we had a pretty good line of sight to exit this year at that level. We felt pretty good that we -- we started tuning into the backlog pretty well. Notwithstanding, again, to your point about an active hurricane season, that was going to be a wildcard. 
But what happened here in between kind of our last plan and today was Texas. And so as the Texas event was unfolding, we basically went back to the drawing board. And we said, look, we had a plan, it's not enough. How do we get more? We can't have lead times going out. 28 weeks is terrible, and that's the average across all channels, all customers, all products. But those lead times are -- that's too long to wait. And we're working hard to bring those in. But that recalibration of the capacity plan, simply put, just without getting too detailed, is to take our level that we're at today which we anticipated would go up somewhat by the end of this year as we brought Trenton online. But effectively, we've now made investments and plans to completely double where we're at today a year from now. So that will ramp throughout the year. And the way we're going to do that is we're going to bring Trenton up quicker. So we're going to need more people, we're going to need more equipment, and we're going to -- we've made those investments, we've made those decisions, and we're executing against that. But we're also making more investments here in Wisconsin. 
So the initial decision was to shift to a secondary location down in Trenton, that's not going to be enough. So we had stood up a temporary line in one of our facilities just outside of Whitewater, Wisconsin, where we build the lion's share of these products. And that temporary line, we're going to actually add another line in that facility, and we're going to augment that production through some subcontracting of component supply. So our constraints are a couple of the major components that go into the units. We're going to subcontract supply. We've got a line of sight on that. That will come online here really kind of end of Q3, beginning of Q4. So that, call it, second line in Wisconsin in that temporary facility. 
So the second line that we're adding in Wisconsin, the quicker ramp of Trenton and then bringing on more equipment early next year is what gets us to doubling kind of where we're at today to where we can be tomorrow. So if we do get an active hurricane season, we feel like that we'd be ready for that. We may still have longer lead times exiting the year than we want. But the kinds of capacity numbers we're talking about here, by the time we get out 12 months from now, are really quite big. So the ability to scale even further, I think, is going to be is going to be possible once we get through that investment process."

No, Mark, it's an important question, and there's 2 types of headwinds here. There's cost headwinds and then there's availability headwinds.

There's cost headwinds and then there's availability headwinds. And so from a cost headwind standpoint, we use a lot of copper, aluminum and steel in our products. So obviously, as those have run here over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen a sizable increase, and that's kind of the cost pressures that York was alluding to on the last question. And we're offsetting that with pricing and other cost out actions. 
Interestingly enough, the second headwind, which is availability, we're also seeing some availability issues within some of those basic materials, which is not something we've typically experienced. So finding electrical-grade steel as an example for the alternators we manufacture, which is the business entity of a generator. That's been challenging. Having to go out to the mills and buy coil stock. We're kind of jumping the supply chain in a lot of cases to get upstream to find rock coil stock to provide to our electrical grade steel lamination manufacturers. So that would be one instance of it. 
I would say more broadly, the electrical components are  in terms of availability. We use a lot of semiconductors, a lot of microprocessors in all of our products. I would say, much more heavier use on our clean energy products, much lighter use on products like Chore products. But nonetheless, there are still a lot of microprocessors across the board. I think that one thing for us, maybe just a little bit of how we've been insulated from some of the current shortfalls you're reading about in automotive and some other areas, as much as I'd love to say, we're an incredibly lean supply chain in terms of inventory levels and whatnot. The fact of the matter is, because of the nature of our business in terms of needing to react to exogenous elements of demand, we have to keep a fair amount of safety stock, and our suppliers have to keep a fair amount of safety stock on hand to feed us when we need to double or triple our output. So there was a fair amount of inventory in the channel, if you will, our supply chain channel, that is, as well as our own inventories. And so that's been helpful in kind of absorbing some of those shortfalls. 
And that being said, we definitely are looking at some problem areas ahead. Now again, we've reflected this, we think, appropriately in our guidance. So there are some areas of our business that I'll just point out clean energy. I mean the demand for clean energy is much higher than what we can produce, simply because of some of the constraints we have on availability at the electronics level, also battery cell production levels. There's constraints there as well. And we're monitoring that, and we're looking at ways we can mitigate that. But we've more heavily reflected that in the guidance for that business. And still, we're saying we're up 75% to 100% in clean energy year-over-year. So -- but it's been a challenge. We're going to continue to manage it the best of our ability. But there's quite a few headwinds out there, but I think our teams have a pretty good handle on it, and we're going to continue to keep fighting here."

As we've said in the past, the replacement rate is roughly about 10% today. We get quarterly updates. That's up nicely. We get quarterly updates on what the replacement rates are. We ask -- we survey people who buy products. Are they buying for replacement? Are they buying it as a new home? Are they buying it as an existing home? So in new construction, it's 15% to 20% of the products going into new construction. So both of those trends are favorable and have been favorable over the long haul. The replacement trend, I think, is maybe the most favorable because when you really just peel back the math on it, and I think we showed this a couple of years ago at an Investor Day, and we may have to update this coming up here in our Investor Day in September, but that -- the replacement rate itself was worth quite a bit of money there, just over the long haul. And so -- and that, I think, as technology continues to improve and the products and, in particular, as those products become grid services enabled, right, in Enbala-ready, the idea of the newer products being in Enbala-ready and the old ones not, that becomes an asset that could be producing for somebody in a different way than just protecting their home. It could be something that is able to be monetized. So pretty interesting stuff there. 
The remote monitoring capabilities that we've added to products over the years also don't exist in generational products 10, 15 years ago. So really interesting trends longer term, and I think they're bullish for us and bullish for the category."

I think, Jed, it might be a little early to be saying it's reading through today, maybe a little bit, but really we've always looked at the sales cycle and just that -- those products because they're budgetary items generally for a business or even a hospital, in some cases. Those are a little more quote-driven. But really, we bifurcate the C&I world into 2 markets. There's the quote-driven and then there's the optional standby markets within just purely standby, right? So quote-driven markets are clear, where you've got to provide backup power because of a wastewater treatment plan, a hospital, some other installation where quotes require that. That's a simple bid process and would be something that is about half of the market. 
The other half of the market then is made up of what we refer to as this optional standby market. And that's really a decision for a business or a business owner, who says, look, I have interruption of my -- maybe it's my revenue streams or I have spoilage of inventory or I have some other thing that happens when the power goes out, it's a negative for my business, and I want to protect that and protect against that, so I invest in backup power. I think the idea there and what we've typically seen is we'll see a follow-on period here for a couple of years, especially after an event like Texas, the magnitude of that event. We'll see increased quotations activity which we're seeing today, increased activity around what types of solutions make sense. You can talk to the specifying engineering firms that are involved in projects like this, down in that region of the country. And they will tell you that there's a lot of inbound interest around businesses and other types of properties looking at adding a backup generator. 
I think what gets really interesting for me is when you can take that backup generator, and C&I is really -- it makes a lot of sense here. You can turn it into a distributed energy resource. Now you're talking about a big chunky block of power that you can take 400, 500, 1 megawatt -- 400 kw 500 kw, 1 megawatt, 2 megawatts of power in a single installation with a single owner that you can put back into the grid. And that's incredibly valuable for or for any of the other -- PJM -- any of the other grid operators out there or utility companies even themselves who can use that asset to help them balance supply and demand. And so that's kind of the new frontier, right? And that's why we invested in Enbala. 
You're going to see us continue to push even further in this. And I mentioned it just briefly in the prepared remarks about, we call it our lead gas initiatives here, which is really about using a natural gas generator for those purposes because in those instances, you're just talking about a cleaner burning machine. The economics are much better around gas. We use a rich burn configuration machine. So it can do quick startup to protect against blackouts as well as provide power back to the grid. So we're the leader in that industry and have been for many, many years. And we're incredibly excited. And that's where we've been getting the most interest actually with the Enbala acquisition. 
As I was mentioning, those sales teams, Enbala and our teams working together many of the projects that we're talking about are natural gas generator projects and larger blocks of power for distribution centers, for manufacturing plants, for other types of installations, critical or noncritical. And I think that's going to be really important because that's really more of energy as a service. If you think about it down the line, that's what it turns into. And I think that's going to be a really exciting part of the growth story for C&I as we go forward."

We're doing well to take some good market share there in a growing market, which is awesome. And we continue to roll out new products, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. But as it relates to supply chain and capacity, I mentioned briefly the battery cell capacity constraints, which anybody, who's electrifying anything today, is dealing with the same situations, and we're no different. We brought on a second source here in the first quarter to augment our primary source of battery cells, battery packs. We'll be bringing on in the second half of the year a third and potentially even fourth source to continue to kind of broaden the supply base for those products. 
That being said, again, we -- as I said before, we've kind of reflected in our guidance. Even though we're talking about a 75% to 100% growth rate year-over-year for clean energy products, we're really -- it could be higher. The demand is much higher. I mean the inbound demand that we're seeing in those product categories is phenomenal, and it's very exciting. And I think this is really ahead of any kind of -- all the major policy changes that are being proposed out there, right? We really didn't even touch on that today much, but the current administration has a whole host of kind of plans and proposals out there related to increasing and extending the investment tax credit, actually giving an ITC credit, making that available for storage only, which is something that would be very interesting, I think, for people, who are looking to add storage to an existing solar array or use storage perhaps as an arbitrage opportunity. 
So we need to continue to work on capacity as, I think, the takeaway here. Our teams are looking at that very hard. And longer term, I think that we're going to need to do some other things there that I think we're probably prepared to talk a little bit more deeply about once we get to our Investor Day in September.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
Our first quarter results were incredibly strong as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all-time records for Generac, despite Q1 historically being the low point for the year seasonally for our business. First quarter revenue margins and profitability were all significantly ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was very broad-based and was heightened -- highlighted by increased shipments of residential products, primarily due to home standby and portable generators.
Home standby build rates were ahead of plan for the quarter, and demand further accelerated due to continuing traction with the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend as well as being driven by significantly higher power outage activity in recent quarters, including the major event in Texas, which also led to a sharp increase in demand for portable generators.
Revenue from C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter domestically with our industrial distributors, national telecom customers and rental customers as well as internationally, mostly in the European region.
Also in terms of profitability, adjusted EBITDA margin came in considerably higher than our previous forecast, driven mostly by greater operating leverage from the significantly higher revenue achieved during the quarter.
Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 70% to $807 million and also increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020, which was our previous all-time record. Growth in the quarter was broad-based, led by a dramatic increase for residential products that more than doubled compared to prior year as shipments for home standby generators were much higher due to record production levels.
Shipments of portable generators also increased driven by the major outage event in Texas and higher outage activity overall in recent quarters. Deliveries of Chore products and clean energy products, such as our PWRcell energy storage system, also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and shipments of C&I products returned to strong growth in the quarter.
Gross margin expanded 370 basis points compared to prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 840 basis points over the prior first quarter to 26.5%, which was the highest EBITDA margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013.
Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the major outage event that occurred in Texas in mid-February. This was a very unique winter event with unusually cold weather in a state that represents our second largest addressable market opportunity for home standby generators and highlighted yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current electrical utility model. This was a high-profile power outage. In fact, the fifth largest event recorded since we began tracking outages more than a decade ago, with rolling blackouts across the state that lasted for several days and impacted over 4.5 million utility customers at its peak.
With the backdrop of the ongoing Home as a Sanctuary trend, we believe the outage in Texas was a dramatic reminder of the pain of losing power in today's day and age and further amplify the importance of having power security for your home or your business. Driven by this event, we experienced yet another dramatic acceleration in demand for home standby generators from the already elevated levels, increasing our lead times to approximately 28 weeks for our most popular models as of today.
As a result, we have further increased our capacity expansion plans for home standby as we target even higher production levels in the second half of the year through a faster ramp of our New South Carolina facility and further expansion of capacity at our Wisconsin facilities. When combined with the broad-based strengthening of demand across the rest of our business, including a significant recovery in C&I products, which are also benefiting from the major Texas event, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. We'll provide additional details regarding our updated guidance in the outlook portion of our prepared remarks this morning.
Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continue to be exceptionally strong and rose even further during the first quarter benefiting from the major event in Texas. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year, with year-over-year appointments more than 5x higher during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The strength was broad-based across the U.S., with the vast majority of states showing triple-digit growth once again, which we believe provides further validation of the need for backup power given the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend.
Activations, which are a proxy for installations, grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year and were also broad-based in strength across all U.S. regions. The power outage severity environment continues to be very active during the quarter and trended well above the long-term baseline average, driven by the Texas event, but also ice storms in several states, severe storms in the Pacific Northwest, outage events in California and smaller scale rolling blackouts in other states due to severe cold temperatures.
In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the first quarter with approximately 7,700 residential dealers, a sequential increase of about 400 new dealers as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately 1,200 dealers higher over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas.
Early here in the second quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to last year as home consultations are running more than double the prior year's level through April. We continue to believe that the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work more from home, learn from home, entertain from home and shop from home.
Now I want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring and energy management remains very compelling and has gained further momentum so far here in 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and demand paced ahead of our expectations during the first quarter.
In addition to the strong demand, key performance indicators for our clean energy-related initiatives continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations grew rapidly as compared to the prior year and were very encouraging sequentially as compared to the fourth quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning also grew at a tremendous rate during the first quarter as compared to prior year, and orders for clean energy products were very strong on a sequential basis during the first quarter, and this strength has continued here in April.
We also have had encouraging success further building out our installer network as we've trained and certified approximately 2,000 dealers as of the end of the quarter, with approximately 800 dealers registered on our Powerplay CE selling system.
As we discussed during the last earnings call, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products, which are expected to come to market throughout the current year. New product launches include deep integration of our PWRcell storage systems with our legacy generator products, the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell system to an existing solar installation and the launch of a new purpose-built generator that can be combined with solar and storage to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid.
Additionally, later this year, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole home storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide both the energy independence and flexibility that we believe consumers really want in these types of systems.
The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly within the U.S., and we are making good progress in building considerable momentum for our energy storage products. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year revenue outlook as a result of higher demand and our expanded distribution in this growing market. We now expect shipments of clean energy products to increase between 75% to 100% as compared to the prior year levels of approximately $115 million, which is an increase from the previous forecast of 50% to 75% growth.
In addition, we achieved a second consecutive quarter of profitability for clean energy products during the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue sequentially for the remainder of the year as we further scale PWRcell system volumes.
Recall that in October of last year, we acquired Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider, and I'd like to provide a quick update on the progress we're making in developing a road map for integrating Enbala's Concerto software platform into our existing generator and energy storage products. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe integrating Enbala's technology will allow us -- will enable us to improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products as well as allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will include the existing software as a service platform that Enbala offers as well as a variety of operational services that enable a more turnkey solution and, ultimately, performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers.
During the first quarter, we began marketing our initial solutions, which involve our legacy products delivered with built-in capabilities to connect to the Enbala platform. These Enbala-ready Generac assets, known as distributed energy resources or DERs can be available to bundle together to form a virtual power plant or VPP solution. We're excited to currently offer this initial capability with our C&I natural gas generators and, as the year progresses, we will begin to introduce this feature with our home standby generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems.
Also, over the last several quarters, the Enbala and Generac commercial sales teams have been working closely together on potential projects with utilities, energy cooperatives and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities during the first quarter.
In addition to the great performance of residential products to start the year, C&I products were also very strong as revenue returned to growth during the first quarter and increased at a strong rate compared to the prior year broadly across a number of markets and geographies as demand continues to recover at a faster pace than we had previously expected.
Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel returned to solid growth in the quarter, with project quoting activity continuing to recover from the beginning of the pandemic last year and once again growing at a solid rate as compared to 2019 levels. This is leading to an improved overall order outlook for the sales channel and, as a result, we're expecting attractive growth during the year.
We also are expecting solid growth from the Energy Systems business. This is our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last July, as our investments in integration activities are producing results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. Shipments to telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year, and we're well ahead of our expectations. Several of our larger telecom customers have materially raised their capital spending outlook for the year leading us to now expect a substantial increase in telecom shipments during the current year relative to our prior forecast.
The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical can be attributed to a number of factors, including the elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' next-generation networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications networks as this infrastructure shifts to the next-generation 5G architecture.
Additionally, we gained further traction in the quarter with our lead gas initiatives through increased quote activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators that are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. This is an emerging part of our C&I business that already had good momentum entering the year. And the major outages in Texas have created additional demand for these products.
Shipments of mobile products to national account rental customers were lower during the first quarter, but exceeded our previous expectations as the rate of decline slowed relative to recent quarters, and we expect a return to growth for these products during the second quarter.
As we mentioned during our last call, we expected shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve from prior year levels as national rental account customers increased their spending on fleet equipment due to improving utilization and rental rates.
Several of our large national rental customers have recently increased their capital spending plans even further. And as a result, we're increasing our outlook for these products as it appears a fleet replacement cycle has begun. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products with the compelling megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans recently announced by the current administration.
Outside of North America, we returned to growth during the first quarter with revenue increasing at a solid core rate of 10% compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in the European region that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. While COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still being felt in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, leading to a significant increase in our international backlog at the end of the first quarter. As a result, our revenue outlook for the international segment has further improved as we now expect strong growth for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin expected to expand considerably year-over-year, benefiting from improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes.
Lastly, our International teams continue to make encouraging progress on several important global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications and expanding our share in the market for telecom backup power in key regions around the world.
In closing this morning, 2021 is developing into a year where our megatrends and macular secular themes -- macro secular themes appear to have significant momentum and are moving in the same direction as we anticipated -- as we are anticipating tremendous growth for our residential products and a significant rebound in demand for C&I products as compared to the prior year.
A key focus for our teams is expanding capacity across the business, both within our own facilities as well as ramping our supply chain to enable our ability to continue to scale. Our operations and supply chain teams have been working aggressively to address ongoing sourcing and logistics delays, component availability constraints and the increasing cost pressures we have been experiencing. We have largely mitigated the impact of these issues up to this point, but the situation remains fluid. That being said, we believe we have appropriately risk adjusted our latest guidance to reflect potential disruptions and additional inflationary pressures that will likely continue to materialize as the year progresses.
Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to our more than 7,000 employees at Generac that have helped us successfully navigate the pandemic while still providing an incredible level of service to our customers and our partners around the world. The hyperscale growth that we are experiencing is a reflection of their commitment to the execution of our strategy and their dedication to our success.
When you combine the strength of our team with our financial strength, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to aggressively invest in a number of strategic initiatives to further accelerate our strategy and build out our capabilities as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions company.
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2021. York?"

Looking at first quarter 2021 results in more detail.

The combination of contribu",2449,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 70% to $807.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $475.9 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 3% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales more than doubled to $542.1 million as compared to $257.6 million in the prior year, representing a 110% increase. Also, residential products improved 9% on a sequential basis as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, benefiting from the significant backlog for home standby generators entering 2021, which is in contrast to the normal seasonally lower volumes experienced during the first quarter that have averaged a 26% sequential decline over the past 5 years.
As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which more than doubled during the first quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. Portable generators also experienced dramatic growth versus the prior year due to the much higher power outage activity, highlighted by the impact from the major event in Texas.
In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, as the solar plus storage market in the U.S. continues to expand and as we build out our capabilities selling into the clean energy space. Lastly, shipments of Chore products were also much higher during the quarter, in part due to the Home as a Sanctuary trend continuing to positively impact demand for outdoor power equipment.
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2021 increased 18% to $202.4 million as compared to $172.1 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a return to growth for C&I products for the first time since the third quarter of 2019, with the previous 4 quarters being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The strength in shipments was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, both domestically and internationally in the following areas.
Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers due to capital spending, further improving for these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives.
Internationally, the increase in C&I products, as previously mentioned, was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European region, that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, which began during the first quarter of last year.
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 36% to $62.9 million as compared to $46.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency.
In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity in recent quarters, a larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus prior year.
Gross profit margin improved 370 basis points to 39.9% compared to 36.2% in the prior year first quarter. Operating expenses increased $23.2 million or 21.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2020, but declined 610 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $214.2 million or a very strong 26.5% of net sales as compared to $86 million or 18.1% of net sales in the prior year. This substantial 840 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter due to favorable sales mix, improved pricing and favorable overhead absorption, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control.
Note, the favorable impact to margins during the first quarter were partially offset by the onset of higher input costs, primarily relating to higher commodities, currencies, labor, freight and logistics costs, and these are expected to have more of an impact on properly starting in the second quarter.
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased a robust 84% to $693 million as compared to $376 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $207.1 million, representing a very healthy 30% margin as compared to $82.8 million in the prior year or 22% of net sales.
International segment sales increased 15% to $115 million as compared to $100 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of currency, increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $7.1 million or 6.2% of net sales as compared to $3.3 million or 3.3% of net sales in the prior year.
Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $149 million as compared to $44.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $35.4 million or an effective tax rate of 19.1% as compared to $9.4 million or an effective tax rate of 17.9% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in the mix of domestic pretax income in the current year, which is taxed at an approximate 25% statutory rate.
Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.33 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.68 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $152.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.38 per share, which is also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $55.1 million in the prior year or $0.87 per share.
Cash income taxes for the first quarter of 2021 were $37.9 million as compared to $7.3 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20.5% for the full year 2021, which is at the lower end of the previously expected range of 20.5% to 21.5% for 2021. This compares to the prior year rate of 14% that was anticipated in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate.
Cash flow from operations was robust at $152.5 million as compared to $11.3 million in the prior year first quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $125.8 million as compared to a negative $1 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented seasonal records for the first quarter of a year. The substantial increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher net income and a lower level of working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher capital expenditures, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina.
Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I wanted to comment briefly on our healthy liquidity position at the end of the first quarter of '21, which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy.
As of March 31, 2021, we had over $1 billion of liquidity comprised of $745 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $872 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs.
Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was only 1.2x on an as reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points.
We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months of $554 million.
I'd now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for the full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. The major outages in Texas have led to an acceleration in demand and backlog for home standby generators. And as a result, our operations team has further increased their capacity expansion plans, and this is leading to a significant increase in the shipment outlook for these products for the full year 2021.
The Texas outages also had a notable impact on portable generator shipments and, with an active sell-through at retail, we are increasing our outlook for these products as well. Also contributing to the improved outlook is higher demand for our PWRcell energy storage systems as we continue to make further progress in building our distribution partners in the clean energy market.
The outlook for C&I products has also improved considerably with a significant pickup demand for telecom national account customers, stronger outlook for domestic industrial distributors, traction with certain projects and beyond standby applications, a further recovery in demand for mobile products and an improved outlook for C&I products within the international markets.
As a result of these incrementally positive end market trends, we are increasing our full year 2020 net sales guidance to now be approximately 40% to 45% growth compared to the prior year, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous as reported guidance of 25% to 30%. At the midpoint of the range, this updated sales growth guidance would result in a year-over-year increase in net sales of over $1 billion.
This revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increased at a very robust rate of over 50% as compared to the prior year. Revenue for C&I products is now expected to rebound at an even stronger rate as compared to the softer prior year comparison, a rate approximately in the mid-20% range.
Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages in line with the longer-term baseline average for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year.
Given the additional capacity expansion for home standby generators that is targeted to increase as the year progresses, we are now expecting the seasonality for revenue in 2021 to be a bit more weighted towards the second half of the year, with sales in the first half being approximately 47% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 53% weighted.
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021. As we've discussed, there continues to be significant cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain, which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs and higher wages. Furthermore, we still expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs, to be offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our profit enhancement program.
As a result, we expect gross margins for the full year 2021 to expand approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year. In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. However, due to the much higher anticipated sales volumes, we should experience improved leverage on our operating expenses relative to previous guidance.
As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25.5%, which is an increase from the 24% to 25% previously expected and an expansion from the 23.5% margin in the prior year.
From a seasonality perspective, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the second and third quarters to be moderately lower relative to the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of rising input costs. However, we believe this impact will be temporary with adjusted EBITDA margins forecasted to improve in the fourth quarter back to first quarter levels, as the rising cost pressures are anticipated to be offset by more favorable mix, additional pricing and cost reduction initiatives that are expected to be realized towards the end of the year.
Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year '21 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5%, which is slightly lower as compared to the 23.5% to 24.5% previously expected.
Our capital expenditures for 2021 as a percentage of forecasted net sales are still projected to be in the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3%. Although with a much higher revenue outlook, this represents an increase in absolute dollar investment compared to our prior expectations, primarily due to additional capacity expansion.

On Enbala, I think our confidence grows daily with that acquisition. It just continues to reinforce our strategic direction around participating more fully in the shift to Grid 2.0, right? I mean that's really what that ac",580,"Sure. No, good questions, Tommy. On Enbala, I think our confidence grows daily with that acquisition. It just continues to reinforce our strategic direction around participating more fully in the shift to Grid 2.0, right? I mean that's really what that acquisition was about. It really was about helping us take our legacy assets, our generators, if you will, as well as our clean energy assets like PWRcell and our load management devices and really expose those distributed energy resources for the benefit of grid operators, utilities, energy aggregators and ultimately the end customers, the owner operators of those pieces of equipment.
What I can say over the last quarter is we continue to dive pretty deep into the pipeline that Enbala had previous to our acquisition. It is substantially larger today than it was, that pipeline -- substantially larger today than it was when we acquired it. We believe there are a couple of reasons for this. One, during the acquisition, of course, that was -- COVID was -- we were in the middle of that, and there was some retrenchment by utilities and others on a lot of things. But certainly, programs like grid services were kind of put down -- they were set down and as they were working on other things. But the volumes have picked up dramatically here based on the fact that COVID has abated. But probably more importantly, many of these customers are telling us that they feel like now they get that Enbala has a partner in Generac that is, one, financially stable and, two, has access to all these wonderful assets, right?
So what Enbala was selling before was software, and it's agnostic software to the OEM and agnostic to even the type of DER, be it storage or be it a generating asset, but -- and we want to maintain that because we think that's important. But I think having the opportunity to provide a full turnkey solution to a utility is really important. It really reduces the friction around which platform should the utility choose, if our assets deeply integrate with it, and they have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute in our financial wherewithal to be able to do that, what we believe that's led to is just a lot more opportunities that we're seeing. So really good things to see there.
On the product pipeline, you mentioned the -- we keep calling it this purpose-built generator. This is really our off-grid generator, if you will. It's a machine that will produce direct current power. So it will be able to charge a battery. It won't provide power to your home during a blackout, but it will be able to provide power to your battery as you deplete the battery, which could be during a blackout or some other time. We think that's a really important kind of critical missing link for those homeowners that really want to defect from the grid. And so think of it as a grid defection enabler. That product will be available later this year. And we're pretty excited about it. We've got a lot of interest in it. We'll see how many people really want to truly defect from the grid. They'll be able to do that after this product hits the market, but it's going to be an exciting launch. We're going to launch it at SPI here in September. So it should be a lot of fun."

And this is where I'll give a huge shout-out to our -- our operations teams are -- it's a fight every day, every hour. I mean they literally have hour by hour kind of metrics that they're pacing against, not only obviously for output, but the ability to hit the kinds of output levels that we're achieving and do it safely and to continue to produce a quality product. These are top of mind for everything we do. It's just -- it's amazing. In full disclosure, I think if you had asked me as the CEO of this company even 6 months ago, if we'd be able to achieve the levels we are at today in the existing footprint, I would have probably taken the under on that bet. I just -- I'm maybe more of a realist at heart and maybe just would have -- you never want to bet against your own team. But these -- these folks on our team just continue to outperform. They're working very closely with our supply chain. That's obviously a major component of this to make sure we get continuous supply.
We've been expanding our supply chain to dual and triple source, which has been incredibly helpful. That was an initiative we actually started back a couple of years ago now, but it's paying off very handsomely. We invested very heavily in automation over the last several years, which is also paying off quite nicely. And really, the way the teams -- to answer your question at the root of it, is the teams are continually looking at ways to improve the operations of the business. So how do we -- squeezing out 0.5 point of efficiency or 0.25 point of productivity out of our equipment, out of our teams, out of our supply chain makes a big difference at the kinds of rates that we're running right now.
Again, we don't know what the future holds. Supply chain is just a really challenging area right now, everything from logistics to component availability. Everybody's talking about this. And we're no different. We have taken a pretty -- I would say, I think we've properly reflected that in the guidance. We'll just say that. I think we kind of handicapped it in a way that we believe these numbers that we're going to put out are achievable based on everything we know today.
If we have some improvement in the supply chain situation, maybe they go higher. We'll see. But I'm just -- I'm incredibly proud of the team. They're just -- they're doing a great job. And really, I can't say more about it."

What kind of capacity do you have to be able to serve that increased demand? Can you help us bridge where you're at now relative to what that potential scenario could be? Any specifics? Can you talk about this capacity expansion plans, Aaron? I know you've talked about adding more in Wisconsin, more in South Carolina, and you can do it earlier. But to what degree can you quantify that? And the wait time is continuing to just go longer. Aaron, I think you talked about 28 weeks, but our recent dealer check suggests the dealers are waiting 35 weeks for the 22-kilowatt engine. So what is the plan to reduce that wait time, serve the busy season, if you will, when that comes in Q3 and 4?"

Thanks, Phil. There's -- capacity discussion here is a daily discussion. We had a plan that we had in place that we were going to bring Trenton online here midyear, which is effectively -- if you think of it this way, it's -- we're calling it a double-double, right? So we're effectively -- we are going to double our capacity. Where we're at today is somewhat kind of double where we were running maybe a little more than a year ago, maybe 12 to 18 months ago. And we had a pretty good line of sight to exit this year at that level. We felt pretty good that we -- we started tuning into the backlog pretty well. Notwithstanding, again, to your point about an active hurricane season, that was going to be a wildcard.
But what happened here in between kind of our last plan and today was Texas. And so as the Texas event was unfolding, we basically went back to the drawing board. And we said, look, we had a plan, it's not enough. How do we get more? We can't have lead times going out. 28 weeks is terrible, and that's the average across all channels, all customers, all products. But those lead times are -- that's too long to wait. And we're working hard to bring those in. But that recalibration of the capacity plan, simply put, just without getting too detailed, is to take our level that we're at today which we anticipated would go up somewhat by the end of this year as we brought Trenton online.
But effectively, we've now made investments and plans to completely double where we're at today a year from now. So that will ramp throughout the year. And the way we're going to do that is we're going to bring Trenton up quicker. So we're going to need more people, we're going to need more equipment, and we're going to -- we've made those investments, we've made those decisions, and we're executing against that. But we're also making more investments here in Wisconsin.
So the initial decision was to shift to a secondary location down in Trenton, that's not going to be enough. So we had stood up a temporary line in one of our facilities just outside of Whitewater, Wisconsin, where we build the lion's share of these products. And that temporary line, we're going to actually add another line in that facility, and we're going to augment that production through some subcontracting of component supply. So our constraints are a couple of the major components that go into the units. We're going to subcontract supply. We've got a line of sight on that. That will come online here really kind of end of Q3, beginning of Q4. So that, call it, second line in Wisconsin in that temporary facility.
So the second line that we're adding in Wisconsin, the quicker ramp of Trenton and then bringing on more equipment early next year is what gets us to doubling kind of where we're at today to where we can be tomorrow. So if we do get an active hurricane season, we feel like that we'd be ready for that. We may still have longer lead times exiting the year than we want. But the kinds of capacity numbers we're talking about here, by the time we get out 12 months from now, are really quite big. So the ability to scale even further, I think, is going -- is going to be possible once we get through that investment process."

No, Mark, it's an important question, and there's 2 types of headwinds here. There's cost headwinds and then there's availability headwinds. And so from a cost headwind standpoint, we use a lot of copper, aluminum and steel in our products. So obviou",559,"Yes. No, Mark, it's an important question, and there's 2 types of headwinds here. There's cost headwinds and then there's availability headwinds. And so from a cost headwind standpoint, we use a lot of copper, aluminum and steel in our products. So obviously, as those have run here over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen a sizable increase, and that's kind of the cost pressures that York was alluding to on the last question. And we're offsetting that with pricing and other cost-out actions.
Interestingly enough, the second headwind, which is availability, we're also seeing some availability issues within some of those basic materials, which is not something we've typically experienced. So finding electrical-grade steel as an example for the alternators we manufacture, which is the business entity of a generator. That's been challenging. Having to go out to the mills and buy coil stock. We're kind of jumping the supply chain in a lot of cases to get upstream to find raw coil stock to provide to our electrical grade steel lamination manufacturers. So that would be one instance of it.
I would say more broadly, the electrical components are, in terms of availability, we use a lot of semiconductors, a lot of microprocessors in all of our products. I would say, much more heavier use on our clean energy products, much lighter use on products like Chore products. But nonetheless, there are still a lot of microprocessors across the board. I think that one thing for us, maybe just a little bit of how we've been insulated from some of the current shortfalls you're reading about in automotive and some other areas, as much as I'd love to say, we're an incredibly lean supply chain in terms of inventory levels and whatnot.
The fact of the matter is, because of the nature of our business in terms of needing to react to exogenous elements of demand, we have to keep a fair amount of safety stock, and our suppliers have to keep a fair amount of safety stock on hand to feed us when we need to double or triple our output. So there was a fair amount of inventory in the channel, if you will, our supply chain channel, that is, as well as our own inventories. And so that's been helpful in kind of absorbing some of those shortfalls.
That being said, we definitely are looking at some problem areas ahead. Now again, we've reflected this, we think, appropriately in our guidance. So there are some areas of our business that I'll just point out clean energy. I mean the demand for clean energy is much higher than what we can produce, simply because of some of the constraints we have on availability at the electronics level, also battery cell production levels. There's constraints there as well. And we're monitoring that, and we're looking at ways we can mitigate that. But we've more heavily reflected that in the guidance for that business. And still, we're saying we're up 75% to 100% in clean energy year-over-year. So -- but it's been a challenge. We're going to continue to manage it the best of our ability. But there's quite a few headwinds out there, but I think our teams have a pretty good handle on it, and we're going to continue to keep fighting here."

As we've said in the past, the replacement rate is roughly about 10% today. We get quarterly updates. That's up nicely. We get quarterly updates on what the replacement rates are. We ask -- we survey people who buy products. Are they buying it for replacement? Are they buying it as a new home? Are they buying it as an existing home? So in new construction, it's 15% to 20% of the products going into new construction.
So both of those trends are favorable and have been favorable over the long haul. The replacement trend, I think, is maybe the most favorable because when you really just peel back the math on it, and I think we showed this a couple of years ago at an Investor Day, and we may have to update this coming up here in our Investor Day in September, but that -- the replacement rate itself was worth quite a bit of money there, just over the long haul.
And so -- and that, I think, as technology continues to improve and the products and, in particular, as those products become grid services enabled, right, Enbala-ready, the idea of the newer products being Enbala-ready and the old ones not, that becomes an asset that could be producing for somebody in a different way than just protecting their home. It could be something that is able to be monetized. So pretty interesting stuff there. The remote monitoring capabilities that we've added to products over the years also don't exist in generational products 10, 15 years ago. So really interesting trends longer term, and I think they're bullish for us and bullish for the category."

I think, Jed, it might be a little early to be saying it's reading through today, maybe a little bit, but really we've always looked at the sales cycle and just that -- those products because they're budgetary items generally for a business or even a hospital in some cases. Those are a little more quote-driven. But really, we bifurcate the C&I world into 2 markets. There's the quote-driven and then there's the optional standby markets within just purely standby, right? So quote-driven markets are clear, where you've got to provide backup power because of a wastewater treatment plan, a hospital, some other installation where quotes require that. That's a simple bid process and would be something that is about half of the market.
The other half of the market then is made up of what we refer to as this optional standby market. And that's really a decision for a business or a business owner, who says, look, I have interruption of my -- maybe it's my revenue streams or I have spoilage of inventory or I have some other thing that happens when the power goes out, it's a negative for my business, and I want to protect that and protect against that, so I invest in backup power. I think the idea there and what we've typically seen is we'll see a follow-on period here for a couple of years, especially after an event like Texas, the magnitude of that event, we'll see increased quotations activity which we're seeing today, increased activity around what types of solutions make sense. You can talk to the specifying engineering firms that are involved in projects like this down in that region of the country. And they will tell you that there's a lot of inbound interest around businesses and other types of properties looking at adding a backup generator.
I think what gets really interesting for me is when you can take that backup generator, and C&I is really -- it makes a lot of sense here. You can turn it into a distributed energy resource. Now you're talking about a big chunky block of power that you can take 400, 500, 1 megawatt -- 400 kw 500 kw, 1 megawatt, 2 megawatts of power in a single installation with a single owner that you can put back into the grid. And that's incredibly valuable for ERCOT or for any of the other -- PJM -- any of the other grid operators out there or utility companies even themselves who can use that asset to help them balance supply and demand. And so that's kind of the new frontier, right? And that's why we invested in Enbala.
You're going to see us continue to push even further in this. And I mentioned it just briefly in the prepared remarks about, we call it our lead gas initiatives here, which is really about using a natural gas generator for those purposes because in those instances, you're just talking about a cleaner burning machine. The economics are much better around gas. We use a rich burn configuration machine. So it can do quick startup to protect against blackouts as well as provide power back to the grid. So we're the leader in that industry and have been for many, many years. And we're incredibly excited. And that's where we've been getting the most interest actually with the Enbala acquisition.
As I was mentioning, those sales teams, Enbala and our teams working together many of the projects that we're talking about are natural gas generator projects and larger blocks of power for distribution centers, for manufacturing plants, for other types of installations, critical or noncritical. And I think that's going to be really important because that's really more of energy as a service. If you think about it down the line, that's what it turns into. And I think that's going to be a really exciting part of the growth story for C&I as we go forward."

We're doing well to take some good market share there in a growing market, which is awesome. And we continue to roll out new products, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. But as it relates to supply chain and capacity, I mentioned briefly the battery cell capacity constraints, which anybody who's electrifying anything today is dealing with the same situations, and we're no different. We brought on a second source here in the first quarter to augment our primary source of battery cells, battery packs. We'll be bringing on in the second half of the year a third and potentially even fourth source to continue to kind of broaden the supply base for those products.
That being said, again, we -- as I said before, we've kind of reflected in our guidance. Even though we're talking about a 75% to 100% growth rate year-over-year for clean energy products, we're really -- it could be higher. The demand is much higher. I mean the inbound demand that we're seeing in those product categories is phenomenal, and it's very exciting. And I think this is really ahead of any kind of -- all the major policy changes that are being proposed out there, right? We really didn't even touch on that today much, but the current administration has a whole host of kind of plans and proposals out there related to increasing and extending the investment tax credit, actually giving an ITC credit, making that available for storage only, which is something that would be very interesting, I think, for people, who are looking to add storage to an existing solar array or use storage perhaps as an arbitrage opportunity.
So we need to continue to work on capacity as, I think, the takeaway here. Our teams are looking at that very hard. And longer term, I think that we're going to need to do some other things there that I think we're probably prepared to talk a little bit more deeply about once we get to our Investor Day in September.

I'd like to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to our customers. Their dedication and tireless execution have helped us to largely overcome the incredible
[Audio Gap] 
guidance due to strong operational execution. Demand for home standby generators remains incredibly robust due to a variety of factors, including continued traction with the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend as well as significantly higher power outage activity over the past several quarters.
Revenue from global C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter, both domestically and internationally, highlighted by national telecom and rental customers and growth within the European region. The revenue outperformance in these areas was partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of portable generators primarily due to supply chain constraints, which has led to lower preseason stocking levels with our retail channel partners.
Adjusted EBITDA dollars were also ahead of our previous forecast, driven mainly by the higher shipping levels, but EBITDA margin was slightly below our expectations given the higher input costs in the quarter.
Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 68% to $920 million and also increased sequentially at a strong rate relative to the first quarter of 2021, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by broad-based strength across the business as both residential and C&I products grew dramatically as compared to the prior year. The growth in residential products was led by robust shipments of home standby generators, which nearly doubled over the prior year due to record production levels. Additionally, shipments of power cell energy storage systems experienced tremendous growth, both over the prior year and sequentially as demand for clean energy solutions continues to rise alongside the rapidly expanding solar plus storage market.
Shipments of C&I products also grew significantly in the quarter as demand continued to recover off the prior year COVID lows at an accelerated rate across a number of markets and geographies and are now solidly above 2019 levels.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 77% as compared to the prior year, with the corresponding margin increasing 120 basis points and adjusted EPS increasing 71%.
Now discussing our second quarter results in more detail, despite strong prior year comparisons due to the emergence of the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend and elevated outage levels, home consultations or sales leads for home standby generators remained strong during the second quarter and increased approximately 50% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the trends seen over the past year, the strength was broad-based across the U.S. with nearly all states experiencing growth again in the quarter, with more than half of all states showing triple growth -- triple-digit growth led by Texas. Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year, with broad-based strength across all U.S. regions, including exceptional growth in the Northeast and South Central regions.
Overall outage activity, as measured on a trailing 4-quarter basis continued to be much higher relative to the prior comparable period and was well above the long-term baseline average, helping to drive awareness of the home standby category. In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the second quarter with more than 8,000 residential dealers, adding over 300 new dealers in the quarter. The build-out of distribution remains a critical focus area as we have added approximately 700 dealers since the start of the year and 1,300 dealers over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas that represent nearly 1/3 of the increase.
Early in the third quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend even higher relative to prior year levels, including home consultations increasing at a strong double-digit rate. We believe the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they are working, learning, shopping, entertaining and in general, spending more time in their homes.
Earlier this month, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new manufacturing facility in Trenton, South Carolina. This facility will provide much needed capacity to further ramp our daily home standby build rates in an effort to reduce lead times, which remain elevated at approximately 28 weeks. With the successful start-up of Trenton combined with a number of other capacity expansion activities, we're now anticipating higher production levels relative to previous expectations. And as a result, we have moderately increased our shipment outlook for these products during the second half of 2021.
In addition, we remain on track to an approximate doubling of our current build rates by the end of the second quarter of 2022, which is nearly 4x greater than our previous baseline output levels at the beginning of last year.
I also want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, we experienced a dramatic increase in shipments of power cell energy storage systems during the second quarter, which was aided in part by a softer prior year comparison as the overall solar market was negatively impacted by a sharp drop in installations due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Shipments of power cell systems also experienced strong growth sequentially as we gain further traction in the rapidly expanding solar plus storage market.
In addition to the strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations expanded at very strong rates as compared to the prior year and sequential trends were also encouraging. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, grew at a tremendous rate during the second quarter as compared to the prior year and also improved on a sequential basis. In addition, we further built out our installer network during the quarter, and we ended the first half of the year with approximately 2,200 trained and certified dealers with nearly 900 of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE selling system.
As we indicated on the previous quarter's earnings call, demand for clean energy products has been outpacing supply, which is limiting our growth rates for the category. Throughout the second quarter, strong end market dynamics around energy storage, coupled with our marketing and distribution initiatives, resulted in further strengthening of demand for clean energy products. In addition, our teams made important progress during the quarter with our supply chain execution regarding power cell energy storage components. As a result, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook and now expect clean energy shipments to approximately double as compared to the prior year. In addition, we're driving profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain.
As we've also discussed on recent calls, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products expected to come to market over the next several quarters. These launches include generator integration with our power cell storage systems, the ability to more efficiently add a power cell system to an existing solar install, the launch of a new DC output generator that can be combined with solar and storage to allow an end user to operate independently in the power grid, and a new load management system that will be paired with our existing Power View energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption.
In addition, we're making our power cell systems smart grid ready, which will enable them to be used in virtual power plant applications using Enbala's Concerto software platform. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we look to further build out our clean energy offerings into a complete ecosystem of products and solutions for installers and end users.
Consistent with this approach, in early July, we entered the large and growing microinverter market for solar applications with the acquisition of Chilicon Power. Based in Los Angeles, California, Chilicon is the designer and provider of grid interactive microinverter and monitoring solutions for the solar market. Recall that the solar plus storage attachment rates are currently between 20% and 25%, which essentially means we weren't participating in 75% to 80% of the market that is focused on solar-only installations. This strategic acquisition will dramatically increase our served market and help us deepen our relationships with solar channel partners and installers as we expand our clean energy product suite to include microinverters.
Industry sources estimate the global market for micro inverters and optimizers used in residential applications, to be approximately $2.5 billion for 2020 and is projected to grow to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2023. We have a proven track record of developing leading energy solutions and we intend to apply the same playbook that we have previously used for other acquisitions in this space with a focus on scaling the business through our innovative lead generation capabilities, our omnichannel distribution approach, the implementation of a variety of cost-out actions and by leveraging Generac's extensive supply chain expertise.
I'd also like to provide a brief update on Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider that we acquired last fall. We are making good progress with the deep integration of Enbala's Concerto software platform with our existing products. And today, we now have this smart grid ready functionality available for all of our C&I natural gas generators, home standby generators and our power cell energy storage systems. Also, over the last several quarters, Enbala has been working closely with Generac's commercial sales teams on potential projects with utilities, cooperatives and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities for the business so far in 2021. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe combining our equipment hardware with Enbala's software is a critical first step by making Generac products smart grid ready thereby allowing them to operate as distributed energy resources known as DERs.
These DERs can be aggregated into a virtual power plant or VPP solution and bundled with turnkey services that should enable us to improve our value proposition to end users, utilities and grid operators, allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will not only include the existing Software-as-a-Service platform that Enbala currently offers, but could also include a variety of vertical operational services that enable a more turnkey solution. and ultimately, even performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers.
The recent heat waves experienced in the U.S. this summer are an important example of the growing need for utilities and grid operators to expand their use of grid services and DER assets. At one point in late June, Enbala enabled the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of its connected fleet to maintain grid stability, predominantly in the Pacific Northwest and Northeast in response to the extreme temperatures that created enormous demand spikes for power in those regions. In these instances, the combination of grid services, software and systems, along with DER assets were used for flexibility response purposes to supplement traditional power plants. We believe systems such as Enbala's concern platform and DER assets like those provided by Generac will become critically important going forward for utilities and grid operators who will be tasked with providing stability and resiliency across their networks as more renewable power, which is highly variable as brought online, and as end users dramatically increase their consumption with the electrification of everything from heating and cooling to transportation over the next decade.
In addition to the great performance of our residential products in the second quarter, our C&I products also had a tremendous quarter as demand across a number of markets and geographies continued to recover at a faster pace than we had previously expected.
Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channels grew again in the quarter at a solid rate, with quoting, project activity and order volumes, further recovering from the pandemic-related lows of last year with growth well ahead of 2019 levels, and we expect attractive growth for this channel for the full year.
We're also experiencing encouraging growth with the Energy Systems business. Our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last year. As our investments, integration activities and overall increased focus are producing excellent results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. Shipments and telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year and we're well ahead of our expectations as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers accelerated and led to a further increase in projected shipments during the current year.
The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications as this infrastructure shifts to the next-generation architecture.
Shipments of mobile-generated mobile products to national rental account customers were also higher during the second quarter as compared to the very soft prior year, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. We still expect shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve dramatically from prior year levels as national rental account customers significantly increased their spending on fleet equipment with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve.
Longer term, we remain optimistic about demand for mobile products with the compelling megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans being pursued by the current administration.
Additionally, we continue to gain important traction with our lead gas initiatives through increased quoting activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in microgrids or other distributed generation applications.
Quoting activity and the sales pipeline is growing significantly for these project opportunities. And revenue for these applications increased at a substantial rate during the second quarter as compared to the prior year, and the outlook has further increased for full year 2021. This is an emerging part of our C&I business that had good momentum entering the year. And with the major winter-related outages in Texas and the extreme heat waves occurring this summer, we're seeing increased interest and demand for these solutions.
To support the growing opportunities we see in our C&I business, we announced the closing of Deep Sea Electronics on June 1, and advanced controls designer and manufacturer headquartered in the United Kingdom. We believe Deep Sea's high level of technical expertise and the added engineering bandwidth their team will give us will be critical to helping us develop and accelerate our product road map for the future bolstering our electronics and control capabilities and supporting further innovation to meet dynamic needs of the evolving energy technology solutions market.
As we advance the use of our products and applications beyond standby power, the need for complex systems level controls for distributed generation, storage and other DDR assets used in microgrid applications will serve as a key enabler of the decentralization of the power grid in the future.
Similar to our domestic C&I products, demand internationally has also rebounded strongly in recent quarters with shipments increasing at a core rate of 45% in the second quarter compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily due to strength in the European and Latin American regions, which experienced a sharp increase in demand as end markets recovered off the pandemic-induced prior year lows. While some COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still lingering in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity continued to recover at a faster-than-expected pace. This is leading to growth in our international backlog at the end of the second quarter with the order strength continuing early on here in the third quarter.
Stronger organic growth, combined with the Deep Sea acquisition are both driving our revenue outlook for the International segment higher than previously expected for the full year. In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand considerably in the second half of the year, primarily benefiting from the impact of the inclusion of Deep Sea's results as well as from improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes.
In closing this morning, we believe our recent strategic acquisitions are important examples of our ability to leverage our strong financial position to further expand our capabilities and advance our strategy as we continue our transition into an energy technology solutions company. We remain focused on developing innovative solutions that enable, protect and improve the efficiency of next-generation power, communications, transportation and other critical infrastructure. And going forward, we intend to continue investing aggressively in a number of strategic initiatives both organically and through acquisitions that we believe can help to accelerate these efforts.

Looking at second quarter 2021 results in more detail.

Net sales increased 68% to $920 million during the second quarter of 2021, an all-time record as compared to $546.8 million in the prior year second quarter. The combination of the energy systems, Mean Green, Enbala and Deep Sea acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 76% to $600 million as compared to $341.4 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust growth, which nearly doubled during the second quarter as shipments benefited from much higher production levels for these products as compared to the prior year. Shipments of power cell energy storage systems also grew at a dramatic rate as compared to the prior year as the solar-plus-storage market in the U.S. continues to rapidly expand and as we build out our marketing and distribution capabilities, selling into the clean energy space.
Horrible generators also increased at a solid rate versus prior year due to the higher power outage severity in recent quarters, and shipments of Shore products also improved at a strong rate, in part due to the electrification of our product lines.
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2021 increased 64% to $254.3 million as compared to $154.9 million in the prior year quarter. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Deep Sea acquisition and favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was in part aided by the softer prior year comparison due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, C&I revenue also grew 6% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels. The strength in shipments compared to prior year was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at an accelerated rate, both domestically and internationally in the following areas.
Domestically, the growth was due to a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers, resulting from much higher capital spending as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Shipments of mobile products recovered significantly compared to the soft prior year comparison as our rental account customers accelerated their fleet replacement given higher utilization and rental rates.
Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives.
Internationally, the increase in C&I products as previously mentioned, was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European and Latin American regions that are recovering sharply from the impacts of the pandemic that existed during the prior year.
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings increased 30% to $65.7 million as compared to $50.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 9% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher power outage activity in recent quarters. A larger and growing installed base of our products and additional extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year.
Gross profit margin was 36.9% as compared to 38.2% in the prior year second quarter, which was impacted by higher input costs in the current year that were partially offset by improved pricing and more favorable overhead absorption from the higher sales volumes. 
Operating expenses increased $37.4 million or 31.3% as compared to the second quarter of 2020, but declined 460 basis points as a percentage of revenue excluding intangible amortization due to the strong operating leverage on substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $217.7 million or 23.7% of net sales as compared to $123.1 million or 22.5% of net sales in the prior year. This 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was primarily the result of the improved leverage of the fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes being partially offset by the aforementioned decline in gross margin.
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 70% to $784.1 million as compared to $460.8 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $203.9 million or 26% of net sales as compared to $121.3 million in the prior year or 26.3% of net sales.
International segment sales increased 57.8% to $135.8 million as compared to $86.1 million in the prior year quarter. With the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency contributing approximately 13% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Going forward, the financial results for Deep Sea Electronics will be included in our international segment, primarily within C&I product class. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests was $13.7 million or 10.1% of net sales as compared to $1.9 million or 2.2% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in international segment margin was primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and the impact of the Deep Sea acquisition.
Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $127 million as compared to $66.1 million for the second quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter was $46.4 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% as compared to $18.5 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item resulting from a legislative tax rate change in the United Kingdom, which revalue deferred tax liabilities by $7 million or approximately 4% tax rate impact during the current year quarter.
Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.02 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $153.2 million in the current year quarter or $2.39 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $88.5 million in the prior year or $1.40 per share.
Cash income taxes for the second quarter of 2021 were $37.4 million as compared to $13.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% for 2021, primarily the result of higher intangible amortization from the Deep Sea acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. Also, the 21% to 21.5% cash tax rate compares to the prior year rate of 17% that was anticipated in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate.
Cash flow from operations was once again robust at $122.5 million as compared to $101.8 million in the prior year second quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $96.3 million as compared to $89 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented records for the second quarter of the year. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher operating earnings in the current year quarter, which was partially offset by a higher level of income taxes paid and capital expenditures in the current year, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina.
Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I want to comment briefly on our strong liquidity position at the end of the second quarter of 2021. In May, we amended our ABL facility increasing its size from $300 million to $500 million and extending the maturity date from June 2023 to May 2026, along with reducing the LIBOR spread to 100 to 125 basis points depending on availability under the revolver. As of June 30, 2021, we had $830 million of liquidity comprised of $390 million of cash on hand and $440 million of availability on the ABL revolver. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $871 million, net of unamortized original issued discount and deferred financing costs.
Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was only 1.1x on an as-reported basis. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months at $561 million, which allows us to confidently operate our business, accelerate our strategy and further enhance shareholder value.
I would now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, there are several areas of the business where we are performing better than expected. And as a result, we are raising our full year revenue outlook for 2021. In particular, the company continues to make better-than-expected progress in increasing production rates for home standby generators. And as a result, we are moderately increasing our shipment outlook for these products for full year 2021. In addition, we are experiencing stronger-than-expected demand for our power cell energy storage systems and combined with additional supply chain execution and the closing of the recent Chilicon acquisition, we are also increasing our shipment outlook for clean energy products as well.
The outlook for C&I products has also improved due to a further broad-based rebound in demand highlighted by a continued pickup in activity from telecom national account customers, overall stronger demand from international markets and the closing of the Deep Sea acquisition. As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 net sales guidance to now be approximately 47% to 50% growth compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 3% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from our previous as reported guidance of 40% to 45% growth, with the majority of the improvement being organic growth. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages for the remainder of the year in line with the long-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year.
Looking at seasonality for the second half of the year. Revenue is expected to increase sequentially in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with an even higher sequential improvement anticipated for the fourth quarter as we further scale home standby production and clean energy shipments.
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021, we continue to experience higher input costs relative to our previous guidance due to rising commodities and significantly higher logistics costs. To address these higher input costs, we implemented additional pricing actions during the second quarter across our product lines, and we continue to focus on cost reduction initiatives through our profitability enhancement program. However, given our current backlog situation, we do not expect to realize these margin enhancements until the fourth quarter and into 2022. As a result of these factors, we now expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be approximately flat as compared to the prior year, which compares to the previous expectation of an approximate 50 basis point increase.
Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25% as compared to the previous guidance range of 24.5% to 25.5% and up from the 23.5% margin in the prior year.
From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the third quarter to be slightly lower relative to the second quarter primarily due to the start-up of the Trenton, South Carolina facility and higher operating expense investments. However, adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter, returning closer to the first quarter levels as a result of pricing realization, improved sales mix, favorable overhead absorption and other margin enhancement initiatives.
Several additional guidance items that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow also require updating for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% for 2021.
Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $32 million, assuming no additional principal payments and flat LIBOR rates for the remainder of the year. This compares to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million with the decline primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate for the year. Our capital expenditures for 2021 as a percentage of forecasted net sales are now projected to be at the higher end of the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3% due to additional capacity expansion actions.
GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecast to be approximately $49 million to $50 million as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million to $35 million, which is due to the closing of the Deep Sea and Chilicon acquisitions, and the related preliminary purchase price allocations.
Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $24 million, which is at the high end of the previous guidance range of between $20 million to $24 million, also due to the recent acquisitions.
Finally, the following remaining miscellaneous guidance items remain unchanged. Our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5% for the full year. Depreciation expense is still forecast to be approximately $40 million in 2021 given our assumed capital spending guidance. Operating and free cash flow generation for full year 2021 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%, and our full year diluted share count is still expected to be approximately 64 million to 64.5 million shares.
This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

The doubling is the max capacity that we would have in total for home standby products by Q2 of next year, the doubling that we refer to, the doubling of where we're at today once everything in Trenton is online. And again, we -- what we're trying to do is build some surge capacity into the system. We've lost that over the last couple of years as the market's growth in home standby has outstripped our pacing of output. So we're hoping to build some additional surge capacity because that business needs that. There's just -- the periods of growth are hallmarked by outage events and other types of things that happen in the external markets and you have to react to that. And again, we've lost a little bit of -- we've lost the ability to get some upside as a result of where we're at today. So that's what we're building out.
In terms of operational kind of milestones or things that we're focused on here over the next, call it, 9 months as we bring that facility fully online. Right now, we're in the initial start-up phase. We actually were fortunate to get in there right at the beginning of the month, which is amazing. It's 4.5 months from when we took occupancy of the facility. So what our team has done there, I'm incredibly proud of. They've worked very, very hard to bring that facility up. We've got about 300 and some employees in the facility today. We've just brought on a second shift. And so what we're pacing to is to have about 800 employees in that facility by the end of the year. And that won't get us to the doubling that we're talking about here.
What gets us even further is the addition of some further manufacturing tooling and automation equipment that we'll be adding into the facilities in Q1 and Q2. And so the addition of that equipment, those additional pieces of equipment is really what takes us to the full potential run rate of that facility by Q2 of next year."

What is the 28 weeks actually based on? We've written in our notes that we think the backlog is closer to $1 billion in dollar terms. I'm just trying to get a sense if that is build directionally in the right ballpark?"

So when we gave that update on the last earnings call, we were quoting it based off of what our expected production rate was going to be in the future. And that's how that's -- and based on order volume and the quantum of the backlog you noted there in your question. That all goes into calculating the backlog. So when we're giving that update again this quarter and the fact that it hasn't changed, but yet we have higher production levels in the future. We've also, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we've been experiencing higher incoming order rates. So that kind of matches up with the higher expected production at this stage.
Now what remains to be seen, as we've said throughout, is kind of how the season plays out in terms of hurricanes, in terms of power safety shutoffs around potential for wildfires out West and in other parts of the country, our guidance doesn't contemplate any of that in there. Now we're not guiding lead times, but what happened mathematically is as the order rate -- as the output -- excuse me, as the production rate kind of outstrips the order rate over time, the lead times would come in. We're still expecting a considerable backlog at this point by the end of the year. I don't know what that exactly will translate to in terms of lead time because we need to understand what the order rate is at that point and also where we're at on the output levels and how we're thinking about our ability to hit that doubling that we've talked about by Q2. So -- it's a -- there's a lot of math that goes into it. And then there's a bit of a forecast as well, obviously, on where we think things are going. But at this stage, it's -- the demand has been incredibly robust. We said this in the prepared remarks as well, we here early in the third quarter in July, our IHCs or home consultation sales leads for home standby are up again on very difficult comps compared to last year. So I mean, it's just -- it continues to amaze us the interest level in the category and how that's translating into real demand. So we're encouraged that, that's very supportive of where we're going with the category in terms of our expanded capacity. We think we're going to be in good shape for that. And then, again, as I said, we'll let the season play out here to see how kind of things shape up as we exit 2021 and go into 2022."

And one, obviously, we watch -- we're watching very closely mainly on the context that we were -- we've been unable -- largely unable to get ahead of demand with our output.

And essentially, what's going to amount to a quadrupling of our output, potentially a quadrupling of our output by Q2 of next year versus where we kind of came into the year last year as a baseline, if you want to use that as a baseline.
In terms of like adding additional capacity, I think a lot of that for us is going to come down to what kind of a season plays out this fall. I think we feel pretty good about -- and remember, capacity is not just about getting a building and equipment and hiring people. It's about the supply chain to support that. So today, we're actually -- this is a process we've gone through pretty rigorously over the last several years as we're constantly sizing the supply chain to be greater than our ability to produce. So we're oversizing the supply chain because it takes longer to get your supply chain to grow. It's just -- it's a longer -- a lot of times you're looking for secondary or even tertiary sources. You have to qualify you have not only find those sources you have to qualify them. and get them ramped. And that generally takes longer. As I said, it took us 4.5 months to get the building, get in there, get it ready to run and get it producing product. And while it's not producing at the top rate that we expected to at this point, we're there. It's kind of the start-up is getting behind us here and we're growing. But really, the supply chain. So we're sizing the supply chain actually larger than that point in Q2 of next year. And so if we see a really strong season this fall and surges in demand off of that, we could react. We do have some room to expand in Trenton. That facility, the area there that we acquired is expandable to about 2.5x its size if we chose to do that. We'd have to analyze whether or not that made sense or if maybe more of the growth is out West, it really kind of depends. It might make more sense to have a facility located closer to wherever we see the demand growth.
So we're going to watch it very closely. We're going to react very quickly. And I think we're going to be in pretty good shape given the expansion in our own capacity by Q2 and then also the supply chain expansion that we've been working on."

Today, it's contract manufacturer here in the U.S. We think that we can -- again, as we stated in the prepared remarks, we kind of put a playbook together here for our approach to this with what we did with Pika. Recall that PICO was also a start-up pretty nascent the demand. It was a very small company. And here we are, we're turning it into just an amazing growth engine for us going forward, we think Chilicon is going to be all of that. I mean, the reason we went after this, we love storage, and we think storage fits really, really well with our approach to the market from a resiliency standpoint in particular. But remember, you're only talking about attachment rates to new solar of 20% to 25%. So in effect, as we try and develop channel partners and as we try and develop our brands in this market, we're not participating in 75% to 80% of what goes on in the market on the solar-only side. So the acquisition of Chilicon is really a way for us to continue to build out what we're referring to internally as a supermarket. I think in our prepared remarks, we had an ecosystem of products, but this -- a suite of products, but this is truly a supermarket approach. We want to have a really broad product offering here from the microinverters themselves all the way through to the storage pieces to our power generation assets that have been also well received by the solar channel, the channel partners there. So in terms of step function change to answer your question directly, more to come on that. We've got an Investor Day here at the end of September. We are going to be debuting these products at the Solar Power International show down in New Orleans in mid-September. Our first kind of area of focus here is to take the existing Chilicon product. And in order to scale it, there are some things we have to do to it. There's some design for manufacturability, considerations alongside the development of the supply chain. We really intend to launch kind of a branded Generac portion of a Generac solution, if you will, of the kind of existing Chilicon technology sometime in really early Q2 of next year. And I think that's when you would see and we would expect to see some inflection. Much the same, again, it's like PICA. It took us a good 6 months by the end of the year. We bought that -- we bought Pike, I think it was in April or May of '19, and it took us until really the beginning of 2020 before we were in the market with a Generac-branded solution there. Kind of a similar -- again, similar playbook and a similar approach here and -- but I think that the result, I mean, look, the served market that we've basically acquired here, I mean, it's massive. I mean, it's a huge market that's dominated by 2 players. And everybody, at least in the U.S., and every particular channel partner that we've talked to on the solar side has told us that there's room for more competition. We're excited to hear that. We think that competition should have a Generac brand on it. We think we're going to be able to use a lot of the things that we've done to be successful in the short time we've been involved in this market with pipeline with Neurio, we think we're going to be able to replicate that success very quickly with Chilicon. So pretty exciting stuff ahead."

So I mean, we're -- that is a -- we're ripping higher with that product category, and we're looking for big things as we exit this year and go into 2022. I think, again, you combine that in my previous remarks here on Chilicon, you put that all together. And I think we're incredibly bullish about the future with clean energy. It's in terms of not only the size of the TAM and the speed at which it's growing, but when you think about storage, speed at which attachment is growing as well. I mean, their forecast for solar alone to grow 40% to 50% next year. 
Attachment rates are going to grow maybe 30% next year from the 2025 they're at this year. You put all that together and for us, it's -- as York said, demand is out shipping supply. So we're really scrambling to add additional supply so that we can satisfy that increase that is coming at us here. So a lot of effort being put on that internally and with our supply chain. And I feel like what we're building there is something that's going to be really exciting in the future."

I can see your point, we're looking to schedule an Analyst Day at the end of September, and that's when we would be updating our long-term targets. So appreciate the ability to get that out there. Relative -- the EBITDA margin bridge versus previous guidance, you're right, it only ticked down at the midpoint of the range. It's only about a 25 basis point moderation there. And -- there are some moving points inside there. So you're right about the cost bucket, the higher input costs, probably did have about a 1% impact on that guidance change, but we were able -- given the volume leverage on the higher sales volumes you're talking about, that's probably -- that probably clawed back about 50 basis points of that 1%. And then from an M&A and mix standpoint, maybe there's another 25 basis points that you're clawing back. So those were good guys offsetting the input cost bad guy. And so net-net, we just believe that there's going to be some moderation.
Once you get through the reality is steel costs have really gone up a lot since our last call, our last guidance, and so has logistics costs, just the cost of a 40-foot containers are up 4x in that window here. So just battling through that. And the good news is we've got some price increases out there. And when we start realizing those in Q4, we start ramping up and absorbing Trenton, South Carolina more and just the better mix when you ship more home standby, coupled with some other cost reduction efforts we're working on. That's why we just -- we feel confident that we're going to be able to bring our gross margins back up in Q4."

So interestingly enough, there's kind of a little bit of a something going on there in the portable industry. Many of the large customers are requesting or even mandating carbon on oxide shut-off technology be put on all portable generators. So the large DIY retail chains have done that, which has created a bit of a challenge around the technology itself is, as you can imagine, with the semiconductor limited supply, there's more technology there on board a portable generator than would traditionally have been involved. So that created a problem with the supply chain. We're working through it. Effectively, what's going to happen is we're not -- we weren't able to fill the channel to the level that the channel wanted nor that we wanted here in Q2 when we would normally do that ahead of the season. So we do have a lot of those products hopefully coming at us here in the third quarter. And I think the idea would be there may be more opportunity.
If the season plays out, there could be opportunity to not only satisfy that increase in demand, but also the channel restock on top of that. So could be a bit of a double hit if the season plays out strongly. We'll have to see how that works. Again, our guidance doesn't contemplate that at this point because we don't have any major outage events in our guide. But it's really kind of a unique thing with those product lines."

What we're finding is that the person who buys a home standby generator is worried about long duration outages. So multi-day events that the kind that you typically see during a hurricane or an ice storm or what you saw in Texas over that winter event or even some of the power safety shutoffs that have been multiple days in length. As much as we love the storage category today, the technology from a performance and cost standpoint are just not competitive with long-duration outage protection that you can get from an engine-driven genset. And where storage has been largely coming in and coming on strong as for somebody who's really already contemplating a solar system. So they're going to be able to generate their own power on the rooftop. And they want to store that power for use at a later time, either because they can sell it advantageously back to the utility or grid operator at a point in time when rates are higher during the day and gain that arbitrage. Between their cost to produce versus their cost of sale or they want some limited outage protection. Certainly, resiliency is a piece of what people are looking at in the storage market. But we would just -- as we've continued to say, throughout, there -- each of those kind of markets, the home standby market and the storage market are kind of concentric circles, and there's a bit of overlap, of course. And over time, as storage technology continues to improve and as the cost continues to come down, it's plausible that you could use storage products for long-duration outage but it's got a long way to go before it gets to that point on a cost-effective basis. So in fact, we actually see quite a few customers that who have a solar system and they have the storage device. They also want to add a generator for the long-duration production, right? So they have the short duration protection with the battery product and also the ability to arbitrage on rate, help them save some money on their power bills but then they want to have a generator also for long-duration outage protection. So we have customers that have all of the products actually. So very interesting to watch how the market develops. But at least at this stage, they seem to be very complementary to one another."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were incredibly strong with broad-based revenue growth of 68% and with all-time records once again for the company this quarter for net sales, adjusted EB",3033,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were incredibly strong with broad-based revenue growth of 68% and with all-time records once again for the company this quarter for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're particularly proud of achieving this tremendous top line growth, along with the record levels of adjusted earnings, despite the ongoing significant cost pressures, logistics challenge and various capacity constraints we faced in the quarter across the supply chain. 
I'd like to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to our customers. Their dedication and tireless execution have helped us to largely overcome the incredible supply chain challenges that have become commonplace in today's post-pandemic operating environment. 
Second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all ahead of our expectations. The revenue outperformance was highlighted by higher shipments of home standby generators as build rates for the quarter were ahead of our previous guidance due to strong operational execution. Demand for home standby generators remains incredibly robust due to a variety of factors, including continued traction with the Home as a Sanctuary mega trend, as well as significantly higher power outage activity over the past several quarters. 
Revenue from global C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter, both domestically and internationally, highlighted by national telecom and rental customers and growth within the European region. The revenue outperformance in these areas was partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of portable generators, primarily due to supply chain constraints, which has led to lower preseason stocking levels with our retail channel partners. 
Adjusted EBITDA dollars were also ahead of our previous forecast, driven mainly by the higher shipping levels, but EBITDA margin was slightly below our expectations given the higher input costs in the quarter. 
Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 68% to $920 million and also increased sequentially at a strong rate relative to the first quarter of 2021, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by broad-based strength across the business as both residential and C&I products grew dramatically as compared to the prior year. The growth in residential products was led by robust shipments of home standby generators, which nearly doubled over the prior year due to record production levels. Additionally, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems experienced tremendous growth, both over the prior year and sequentially as demand for clean energy solutions continues to rise alongside the rapidly expanding solar-plus-storage market. 
Shipments of C&I products also grew significantly in the quarter as demand continued to recover off the prior year COVID lows at an accelerated rate across a number of markets and geographies and are now solidly above 2019 levels. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 77% as compared to the prior year with the corresponding margin increasing 120 basis points and adjusted EPS increasing 71%.
Now discussing our second quarter results in more detail, despite strong prior year comparisons due to the emergence of the Home as a Sanctuary mega trend and elevated outage levels, home consultations or sales leads for home standby generators remained strong during the second quarter and increased approximately 50% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the trends seen over the past year, the strength was broad-based across the U.S. with nearly all states experiencing growth again in the quarter with more than half of all states showing triple growth -- triple-digit growth, led by Texas. Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year with broad-based strength across all U.S. regions, including exceptional growth in the Northeast and South Central regions. 
Overall outage activity, as measured on a trailing 4-quarter basis, continued to be much higher relative to the prior comparable period and was well above the long-term baseline average, helping to drive awareness of the home standby category. In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the second quarter with more than 8,000 residential dealers, adding over 300 new dealers in the quarter. The build-out of distribution remains a critical focus area as we have added approximately 700 dealers since the start of the year and 1,300 dealers over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas that represent nearly 1/3 of the increase. 
Early in the third quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend even higher relative to prior year levels, including home consultations increasing at a strong double-digit rate. We believe the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they are working, learning, shopping, entertaining and, in general, spending more time in their homes. 
Earlier this month, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new manufacturing facility in Trenton, South Carolina. This facility will provide much-needed capacity to further ramp our daily home standby build rates in an effort to reduce lead times, which remain elevated at approximately 28 weeks. With the successful start-up of Trenton, combined with a number of other capacity expansion activities, we're now anticipating higher production levels relative to previous expectations. And as a result, we have moderately increased our shipment outlook for these products during the second half of 2021. 
In addition, we remain on track to an approximate doubling of our current build rates by the end of the second quarter of 2022, which is nearly 4x greater than our previous baseline output levels at the beginning of last year. 
I also want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, we experienced a dramatic increase in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems during the second quarter, which was aided, in part, by a softer prior year comparison as the overall solar market was negatively impacted by a sharp drop in installations due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Shipments of PWRcell systems also experienced strong growth sequentially as we gained further traction in the rapidly expanding solar-plus-storage market. 
In addition to the strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations expanded at very strong rates as compared to the prior year and sequential trends were also encouraging. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, grew at a tremendous rate during the second quarter as compared to the prior year and also improved on a sequential basis. In addition, we further built out our installer network during the quarter, and we ended the first half of the year with approximately 2,200 trained and certified dealers with nearly 900 of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE selling system. 
As we indicated on the previous quarter's earnings call, demand for clean energy products has been outpacing supply, which is limiting our growth rates for the category. Throughout the second quarter, strong end market dynamics around energy storage, coupled with our marketing and distribution initiatives, resulted in further strengthening of demand for clean energy products. In addition, our teams made important progress during the quarter with our supply chain execution regarding PWRcell energy storage components. As a result, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook and now expect clean energy shipments to approximately double as compared to the prior year. In addition, we're driving profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain. 
As we've also discussed on recent calls, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products expected to come to market over the next several quarters. These launches include generator integration with our PWRcell storage systems, the ability to more efficiently add a PWRcell system to an existing solar install, the launch of a new DC output generator that can be combined with solar and storage to allow an end user to operate independently in the power grid and a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption.
In addition, we're making our PWRcell systems smart grid ready, which will enable them to be used in virtual power plant applications using Enbala's Concerto software platform. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we look to further build out our clean energy offerings into a complete ecosystem of products and solutions for installers and end users. 
Consistent with this approach, in early July, we entered the large and growing microinverter market for solar applications with the acquisition of Chilicon Power. Based in Los Angeles, California, Chilicon is the designer and provider of grid-interactive microinverter and monitoring solutions for the solar market. Recall that the solar-plus-storage attachment rates are currently between 20% and 25%, which essentially means we weren't participating in 75% to 80% of the market that is focused on solar-only installations. This strategic acquisition will dramatically increase our served market and help us deepen our relationships with solar channel partners and installers as we expand our clean energy product suite to include microinverters.
Industry sources estimate the global market for microinverters and optimizers used in residential applications to be approximately $2.5 billion for 2020 and is projected to grow to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2023. We have a proven track record of developing leading energy solutions, and we intend to apply the same playbook that we have previously used for other acquisitions in the space with a focus on scaling the business through our innovative lead-generation capabilities, our omnichannel distribution approach, the implementation of a variety of cost-out actions and by leveraging Generac's extensive supply chain expertise.
I'd also like to provide a brief update on Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider that we acquired last fall. We are making good progress with the deep integration of Enbala's Concerto software platform with our existing products. And today, we now have this smart grid ready functionality available for all of our C&I natural gas generators, home standby generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems. 
Also, over the last several quarters, Enbala has been working closely with Generac's commercial sales teams on potential projects with utilities, cooperatives and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities for the business so far in 2021. 
As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe combining our equipment hardware with Enbala's software is a critical first step by making Generac products smart grid ready, thereby allowing them to operate as distributed energy resources known as DERs. These DERs can be aggregated into a virtual power plant, or VPP, solution and bundled with turnkey services that should enable us to improve our value proposition to end users, utilities and grid operators, allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will not only include the existing Software-as-a-Service platform that Enbala currently offers but could also include a variety of vertical operational services that enable a more turnkey solution and ultimately even performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers.
The recent heat waves experienced in the U.S. this summer are an important example of the growing need for utilities and grid operators to expand their use of grid services and DER assets. At one point in late June, Enbala enabled the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of its connected fleet to maintain grid stability, predominantly in the Pacific Northwest and Northeast, in response to the extreme temperatures that created enormous demand spikes for power in those regions. 
In these instances, the combination of grid services, software and systems, along with DER assets, were used for flexibility response purposes to supplement traditional power plants. We believe systems, such as Enbala's Concerto platform and DER assets like those provided by Generac, will become critically important going forward for utilities and grid operators who will be tasked with providing stability and resiliency across their networks as more renewable power, which is highly variable as brought online, and as end users dramatically increase their consumption with the electrification of everything from heating and cooling to transportation over the next decade. 
In addition to the great performance of our residential products in the second quarter, our C&I products also had a tremendous quarter as demand across a number of markets and geographies continued to recover at a faster pace than we had previously expected. Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channels grew again in the quarter at a solid rate with quoting, project activity and order volumes further recovering from the pandemic-related lows of last year with growth well ahead of 2019 levels, and we expect attractive growth for this channel for the full year. 
We're also experiencing encouraging growth with the Energy Systems business, our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last year as our investments, integration activities and overall increased focus are producing excellent results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. 
Shipments and telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year, and we're well ahead of our expectations as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers accelerated and led to a further increase in projected shipments during the current year. 
The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications as this infrastructure shifts to the next-generation architecture. 
Shipments of mobile-generated -- mobile products to national rental account customers were also higher during the second quarter as compared to the very soft prior year, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. We still expect shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve dramatically from prior year levels as national rental account customers significantly increase their spending on fleet equipment with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve.
Longer term, we remain optimistic about demand for mobile products with the compelling mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans being pursued by the current administration.
Additionally, we continue to gain important traction with our lead gas initiatives through increased quoting activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in microgrids or other distributed generation applications.
Quoting activity and the sales pipeline is growing significantly for these project opportunities, and revenue for these applications increased at a substantial rate during the second quarter as compared to the prior year, and the outlook has further increased for full year 2021. 
This is an emerging part of our C&I business that had good momentum entering the year. And with the major winter-related outages in Texas and the extreme heat waves occurring this summer, we're seeing increased interest and demand for these solutions. 
To support the growing opportunities we see in our C&I business, we announced the closing of Deep Sea Electronics on June 1, an advanced controls designer and manufacturer headquartered in the United Kingdom. We believe Deep Sea's high level of technical expertise and the added engineering bandwidth their team will give us will be critical to helping us develop and accelerate our product road map for the future, bolstering our electronics and controls capabilities and supporting further innovation to meet dynamic needs of the evolving energy technology solutions market. 
As we advance the use of our products and applications beyond standby power, the need for complex systems level controls for distributed generation, storage and other DER assets used in microgrid applications will serve as a key enabler of the decentralization of the power grid in the future. 
Similar to our domestic C&I products, demand internationally has also rebounded strongly in recent quarters with shipments increasing at a core rate of 45% in the second quarter compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily due to strength the European and Latin American regions, which experienced a sharp increase in demand as end markets recovered off the pandemic-induced prior year lows. 
While some COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still lingering in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity continued to recover at a faster-than-expected pace. This is leading to growth in our international backlog at the end of the second quarter with the order strength continuing early on here in the third quarter.
Stronger organic growth, combined with the Deep Sea acquisition, are both driving our revenue outlook for the International segment higher than previously expected for the full year. In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand considerably in the second half of the year, primarily benefiting from the impact of the inclusion of Deep Sea's results as well as from improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. 
In closing this morning, we believe our recent strategic acquisitions are important examples of our ability to leverage our strong financial position to further expand our capabilities and advance our strategy as we continue our transition into an energy technology solutions company. We remain focused on developing innovative solutions that enable, protect and improve the efficiency of next-generation power, communications, transportation and other critical infrastructure. And going forward, we intend to continue investing aggressively in a number of strategic initiatives, both organically and through acquisitions, that we believe can help to accelerate these efforts. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook for 2021. York?"

Looking at second quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 68% to $920 million during the second quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $546.8 million in the prior year second quarter. The combination of the Ene",2473,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 68% to $920 million during the second quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $546.8 million in the prior year second quarter. The combination of the Energy Systems, Mean Green, Enbala and Deep Sea acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 76% to $600 million as compared to $341.4 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust growth, which nearly doubled during the second quarter, as shipments benefited from much higher production levels for these products as compared to the prior year. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a dramatic rate as compared to the prior year as the solar-plus-storage market in the U.S. continues to rapidly expand and as we build out our marketing and distribution capabilities selling into the clean energy space. 
Portable generators also increased at a solid rate versus prior year due to the higher power outage severity in recent quarters, and shipments of chore products also improved at a strong rate, in part, due to the electrification of our product lines. 
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2021 increased 64% to $254.3 million as compared to $154.9 million in the prior year quarter. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Deep Sea acquisition and favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was, in part, aided by the softer prior year comparison due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, C&I revenue also grew 6% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels. 
The strength in shipments compared to prior year was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at an accelerated rate, both domestically and internationally, in the following areas. 
Domestically, the growth was due to a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers, resulting from much higher capital spending as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Shipments of mobile products recovered significantly compared to the soft prior year comparison as our rental account customers accelerated their fleet replacement given higher utilization and rental rates. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives. 
Internationally, the increase in C&I products, as previously mentioned, was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European and Latin American regions that are recovering sharply from the impacts of the pandemic that existed during the prior year. 
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 30% to $65.7 million as compared to $50.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 9% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher power outage activity in recent quarters. A larger and growing installed base of our products and additional extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year. 
Gross profit margin was 36.9% as compared to 38.2% in the prior year second quarter, which was impacted by higher input costs in the current year that were partially offset by improved pricing and more favorable overhead absorption from the higher sales volumes.
Operating expenses increased $37.4 million or 31.3% as compared to the second quarter of 2020 but declined 460 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization, due to the strong operating leverage on substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter. 
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $217.7 million or 23.7% of net sales as compared to $123.1 million or 22.5% of net sales in the prior year. This 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was primarily the result of the improved leverage of the fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes being partially offset by the aforementioned decline in gross margin. 
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 70% to $784.1 million as compared to $460.8 million in the prior year quarter with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $203.9 million or 26% of net sales as compared to $121.3 million in the prior year or 26.3% of net sales. 
International segment sales increased 57.8% to $135.8 million as compared to $86.1 million in the prior year quarter with the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency contributing approximately 13% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Going forward, the financial results for Deep Sea Electronics will be included in our international segment, primarily within C&I product class. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests was $13.7 million or 10.1% of net sales as compared to $1.9 million or 2.2% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in international segment margin was primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and the impact of the Deep Sea acquisition.
Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $127 million as compared to $66.1 million for the second quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter was $46.4 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% as compared to $18.5 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item resulting from a legislative tax rate change in the United Kingdom, which revalued deferred tax liabilities by $7 million or approximately 4% tax rate impact during the current year quarter. 
Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.02 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $153.2 million in the current year quarter or $2.39 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $88.5 million in the prior year or $1.40 per share.
Cash income taxes for the second quarter of 2021 were $37.4 million as compared to $13.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% for 2021, primarily the result of higher intangible amortization from the Deep Sea acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Also, the 21% to 21.5% cash tax rate compares to the prior year rate of 17% that was anticipated in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate.
Cash flow from operations was once again robust at $122.5 million as compared to $101.8 million in the prior year second quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $96.3 million as compared to $89 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented records for the second quarter of the year. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher operating earnings in the current year quarter, which was partially offset by a higher level of income taxes paid and capital expenditures in the current year, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina.
Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I want to comment briefly on our strong liquidity position at the end of the second quarter of 2021. In May, we amended our ABL facility, increasing its size from $300 million to $500 million and extending the maturity date from June 2023 to May 2026, along with reducing the LIBOR spread to 100 to 125 basis points depending on availability under the revolver. As of June 30, 2021, we had $830 million of liquidity comprised of $390 million of cash on hand and $440 million of availability on the ABL revolver. 
Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $871 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was only 1.1x on an as-reported basis. 
Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months at $561 million, which allows us to confidently operate our business, accelerate our strategy and further enhance shareholder value.
I would now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, there are several areas of the business where we are performing better than expected. And as a result, we are raising our full year revenue outlook for 2021. In particular, the company continues to make better-than-expected progress in increasing production rates for home standby generators. And as a result, we are moderately increasing our shipment outlook for these products for full year 2021. In addition, we are experiencing stronger-than-expected demand for our PWRcell energy storage systems. And combined with additional supply chain execution and the closing of the recent Chilicon acquisition, we are also increasing our shipment outlook for clean energy products as well.
The outlook for C&I products has also improved due to a further broad-based rebound in demand highlighted by a continued pickup in activity from telecom national account customers, overall stronger demand from international markets and the closing of the Deep Sea acquisition. 
As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 net sales guidance to now be approximately 47% to 50% growth compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 3% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from our previous as-reported guidance of 40% to 45% growth with the majority of the improvement being organic growth. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages for the remainder of the year in line with the long-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year.
Looking at seasonality for the second half of the year, revenue is expected to increase sequentially in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with an even higher sequential improvement anticipated for the fourth quarter as we further scale home standby production and clean energy shipments.
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021, we continue to experience higher input costs relative to our previous guidance due to rising commodities and significantly higher logistics costs. To address these higher input costs, we implemented additional pricing actions during the second quarter across our product lines, and we continue to focus on cost-reduction initiatives through our profitability enhancement program. However, given our current backlog situation, we do not expect to realize these margin enhancements until the fourth quarter and into 2022. As a result of these factors, we now expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be approximately flat as compared to the prior year, which compares to the previous expectation of an approximate 50 basis point increase.
Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25% as compared to the previous guidance range of 24.5% to 25.5% and up from the 23.5% margin in the prior year. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the third quarter to be slightly lower relative to the second quarter, primarily due to the start-up of the Trenton, South Carolina facility and higher operating expense investments. However, adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter, returning closer to the first quarter levels as a result of pricing realization, improved sales mix, favorable overhead absorption and other margin enhancement initiatives.
Several additional guidance items that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow also require updating for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% for 2021.
Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $32 million, assuming no additional principal payments and flat LIBOR rates for the remainder of the year. This compares to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million with the decline primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate for the year. Our capital expenditures for 2021 as a percentage of forecasted net sales are now projected to be at the higher end of the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3% due to additional capacity expansion actions.
GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecast to be approximately $49 million to $50 million as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million to $35 million, which is due to the closing of the Deep Sea and Chilicon acquisitions and the related preliminary purchase price allocations.
Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $24 million, which is at the high end of the previous guidance range of between $20 million to $24 million, also due to the recent acquisitions.
Finally, the following remaining miscellaneous guidance items remain unchanged. Our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5% for the full year. Depreciation expense is still forecast to be approximately $40 million in 2021 given our assumed capital spending guidance. Operating and free cash flow generation for full year 2021 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%, and our full year diluted share count is still expected to be approximately 64 million to 64.5 million shares.
This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

And again, we -- what we're trying to do is build some surge capacity into the system. We've lost that over the last couple of years as the market's growth in home standby has outstripped our pacing of output, so we're hoping to build some additional surge capacity because that business needs that. There's just -- the periods of growth are hallmarked by outage events and other types of things that happen in the external markets, and you have to react to that. And again, we've lost a little bit of -- we've lost the ability to get some upside as a result of where we're at today. So that's what we're building out.
In terms of operational kind of milestones or things that we're focused on here over the next, call it, 9 months as we bring that facility fully online. Right now, we're in the initial start-up phase. We actually were fortunate to get in there right at the beginning of the month, which is amazing. It's 4.5 months from when we took occupancy of the facility. So what our team has done there, I'm incredibly proud of. They've worked very, very hard to bring that facility up. We've got about 300 and some employees in the facility today. We've just brought on a second shift. And so what we're pacing to is to have about 800 employees in that facility by the end of the year, and that won't get us to the doubling that we're talking about here.
What gets us even further is the addition of some further manufacturing tooling and automation equipment that we'll be adding into the facilities in Q1 and Q2. And so the addition of that equipment, those additional pieces of equipment is really what takes us to the full potential run rate of that facility by Q2 of next year."

In other words, when you quoted the 28 weeks last quarter, was that based on the capacity pre-Trenton, and now you're basing on the capacity with Trenton? Or how do we think about that? What is the 28 weeks actually based on? We've written in our notes that we think the backlog is closer to $1 billion in dollar terms. I'm just trying to get a sense if that is build directionally in the right ballpark?"

Ross, the way to think about that is the quoted lead time would be the lead time today, right? So when we gave that update on the last earnings call, we were quoting it based off of what our expected production rate was going to be in the future. And",458,"Yes. Ross, the way to think about that is the quoted lead time would be the lead time today, right? So when we gave that update on the last earnings call, we were quoting it based off of what our expected production rate was going to be in the future. And that's how that's -- and based on order volume and the quantum of the backlog you noted there in your question. That all goes into calculating the backlog. So when we're giving that update again this quarter and the fact that it hasn't changed, yet we have higher production levels in the future, we've also, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we've been experiencing higher incoming order rates. So that kind of matches up with the higher expected production at this stage.
Now what remains to be seen, as we've said throughout, is kind of how the season plays out in terms of hurricanes, in terms of power safety shutoffs, around potential for wildfires out West and in other parts of the country. Our guidance doesn't contemplate any of that in there. 
Now we're not guiding lead times, but what would happen mathematically is as the order rate -- as the output -- excuse me, as the production rate kind of outstrips the order rate over time, the lead times would come in. 
We're still expecting a considerable backlog at this point by the end of the year. I don't know what that exactly will translate to in terms of lead time because we need to understand what the order rate is at that point and also where we're at on the output levels and how we're thinking about our ability to hit that doubling that we've talked about by Q2. 
So it's a -- there's a lot of math that goes into it, and then there's a bit of a forecast as well, obviously, on where we think things are going. But at this stage, it's -- the demand has been incredibly robust. We said this in the prepared remarks as well. even here in the third quarter in July, our IHCs or home consultation sales leads for home standby are up again on very difficult comps compared to last year. 
So I mean, it's just -- it continues to amaze us, the interest level in the category and how that's translating into real demand. So we're encouraged that that's very supportive of where we're going with the category in terms of our expanded capacity. We think we're going to be in good shape for that. And then, again, as I said, we'll let the season play out here to see how kind of things shape up as we exit 2021 and go into 2022."

It's a good question, Phil, and one, obviously, we watch -- we're watching very closely, mainly on the context that we were -- we've been unable -- largely unable to get ahead of demand with our output. And that's why we've gone very heavy here with the Trenton investment. And essentially, what's going to amount to a quadrupling of our output, potentially a quadrupling of our output by Q2 of next year versus where we kind of came into the year last year as a baseline, if you want to use that as a baseline.
In terms of like adding additional capacity, I think a lot of that for us is going to come down to what kind of a season plays out this fall. I think we feel pretty good about -- and remember, capacity is not just about getting a building and equipment and hiring people. It's about the supply chain to support that. 
So today, we're actually -- this is a process we've gone through pretty rigorously over the last several years as we're constantly sizing the supply chain to be greater than our ability to produce. So we're oversizing the supply chain because it takes longer to get your supply chain to grow. It's just -- it's a longer -- a lot of times, you're looking for secondary or even tertiary sources. You have to qualify -- you have to not only find those sources. You have to qualify them and get them ramped, and that generally takes longer. As I said, it took us 4.5 months to get the building, get in there, get it ready to run and get it producing product. And while it's not producing at the top rate that we expected to at this point, we're there. It's kind of -- the start-up is getting behind us here, and we're growing. 
But really, the supply chain. So we're sizing the supply chain actually larger than that point in Q2 of next year. And so if we see a really strong season this fall and surges in demand off of that, we could react. We do have some room to expand in Trenton. That facility, the area there that we acquired is expandable to about 2.5x its size, if we chose to do that. We'd have to analyze whether or not that made sense or if maybe more of the growth is out West. It really kind of depends. It might make more sense to have a facility located closer to wherever we see the demand growth.
So we're going to watch it very closely. We're going to react very quickly. And I think we're going to be in pretty good shape given the expansion in our own capacity by Q2 and then also the supply chain expansion that we've been working on."

Let me try to unpack some of that, Brian, because they are really good questions. Chilicon is a -- we're very excited about this acquisition. It's a small company, basically a start-up today, really like the technology, really like what they've done",671,"Yes. Let me try to unpack some of that, Brian, because they are really good questions. Chilicon is a -- we're very excited about this acquisition. It's a small company, basically a start-up today, really like the technology, really like what they've done with the product line in its early stages. We've got work to do to scale it, of course. Today, it's contract manufacturer here in the U.S. 
We think that we can -- again, as we stated in the prepared remarks, we kind of put a playbook together here for our approach to this with what we did with Pika. Recall that Pika was also a start-up, pretty nascent. The demand was -- it was a very small company. And here we are, we're turning it into just an amazing growth engine for us going forward. We think Chilicon is going to be all of that. 
I mean the reason we went after this, we love storage, and we think storage fits really, really well with our approach to the market from a resiliency standpoint in particular. But remember, you're only talking about attachment rates to new solar of 20% to 25%. So in effect, as we try and develop channel partners and as we try and develop our brands in this market, we're not participating in 75% to 80% of what goes on in the market on the solar-only side. So the acquisition of Chilicon is really a way for us to continue to build out what we're referring to internally as a supermarket. I think in our prepared remarks, we had an ecosystem of products, but this -- a suite of products, but this is truly a supermarket approach. We want to have a really broad product offering here from the microinverters themselves all the way through to the storage pieces to our power generation assets that have been also well received by the solar channel, the channel partners there. 
So in terms of step function change, to answer your question directly, more to come on that. We've got an Investor Day here at the end of September. We are going to be debuting these products at the Solar Power International showdown in New Orleans in mid-September. 
Our first kind of area of focus here is to take the existing Chilicon product. And in order to scale it, there are some things we have to do to it. There's some design for manufacturability, considerations alongside the development of the supply chain. We really intend to launch kind of a branded Generac portion -- a Generac solution, if you will, of the kind of existing Chilicon technology sometime in really early Q2 of next year. And I think that's when you would see and we would expect to see some inflection. 
Much the same -- again, it's like Pika. It took us a good 6 months. By the end of the year, we bought that -- we bought Pika, I think it was in April or May of '19, and it took us till really the beginning of 2020 before we were in the market with a Generac-branded solution there. Kind of a similar -- again, similar playbook and a similar approach here and -- but I think that the result -- I mean, look, the served market that we've basically acquired here, I mean, is massive. I mean it's a huge market that's dominated by 2 players. 
And everybody, at least in the U.S., and every particular channel partner that we've talked to on the solar side has told us that there's room for more competition. We're excited to hear that. We think that competition should have a Generac brand on it. We think we're going to be able to use a lot of the things that we've done to be successful in the short time we've been involved in this market with Pika and with Neurio. We think we're going to be able to replicate that success very quickly with Chilicon, so pretty exciting stuff ahead."

Relative -- the EBITDA margin bridge versus previous guidance, you're right, it only ticked down at the midpoint of the range. It's only about a 25 basis point moderation there, and there are some moving points inside there. So you're right about the cost bucket, the higher input costs probably did have about a 1% impact on that guidance change, but we were able -- given the volume leverage on the higher sales volumes you're talking about, that's probably -- that probably clawed back about 50 basis points of that 1%. And then from an M&A and mix standpoint, maybe there's another 25 basis points that you're clawing back. So those were good guys offsetting the input cost bad guy. And so net-net, we just believe that there's going to be some moderation.
Once you get through -- the reality is steel costs have really gone up a lot since our last call, our last guidance and so has logistics costs. Just the cost of 40-foot containers are up 4x in that window here, so just battling through that. And the good news is we've got some price increases out there. And when we start realizing those in Q4, we start ramping up and absorbing Trenton, South Carolina more and just the better mix when you ship more home standby, coupled with some other cost-reduction efforts we're working on. That's why we just -- we feel confident that we're going to be able to bring our gross margins back up in Q4."

Effectively, what's going to happen is we're not -- we weren't able to fill the channel to the level that the channel wanted nor that we wanted here in Q2 when we would normally do that ahead of the season. So we do have a lot of those products hopefully coming at us here in the third quarter, and I think the idea would be there may be more opportunity.
If the season plays out, there could be opportunity to not only satisfy that increase in demand, but also the channel restock on top of that. So could be a bit of a double hit if the season plays out strongly. We'll have to see how that works. Again, our guidance doesn't contemplate that at this point because we don't have any major outage events in our guide. But it's really kind of a unique thing with those product lines."

So at this stage of the game, they're actually very complementary. What we're finding is that the person who buys a home standby generator is worried about long-duration outages, So multi-day events that -- the kind that you typically see during a hurricane or an ice storm or what you saw in Texas over that winter event or even some of the power safety shutoffs that have been multiple days in length. 
As much as we love the storage category today, the technology from a performance and cost standpoint are just not competitive with long-duration outage protection that you can get from an engine-driven genset. 
Where storage has been largely coming in and coming on strong is for somebody who's really already contemplating a solar system, so they're going to be able to generate their own power on the rooftop. And they want to store that power for use at a later time, either because they can sell it advantageously back to the utility or grid operator at a point in time when rates are higher during the day and gain that arbitrage between their cost to produce versus their cost of sale or they want some limited outage protection. 
Certainly, resiliency is a piece of what people are looking at in the storage market. But we would just -- as we've continued to say throughout, there -- each of those kind of markets, the home standby market and the storage market are kind of concentric circles. And there's a bit of overlap, of course. And over time, as storage technology continues to improve and as the cost continues to come down, it's plausible that you could use storage products for long-duration outage, but it's got a long way to go before it gets to that point on a cost-effective basis. 
So -- in fact, we actually see quite a few customers that -- who have a solar system and they have the storage device, they also want to add a generator for the long-duration protection, right? So they have the short-duration protection with the battery product and also the ability to arbitrage on rate, help them save some money on their power bills, but then they want to have a generator also for long-duration outage protection. So we have customers that have all of the products actually. So very interesting to watch how the market develops. But at least at this stage, they seem to be very complementary to one another."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another quarter of exceptional demand as interest in our home standby generators, clean energy systems and C&I products remained incredibly strong. Production levels",3292,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another quarter of exceptional demand as interest in our home standby generators, clean energy systems and C&I products remained incredibly strong. Production levels were also the highest we have ever experienced in the quarter, with shipments of home standby generators increasing at a substantial rate over the prior year as we continue to ramp output at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. This led to record revenue growth of 34% in spite of significant operational obstacles faced across the supply chain environment that deteriorated further during the third quarter.
Even with the higher output levels, demand remained very strong and broad-based leading to higher backlog levels, particularly for home standby generators, providing us with good visibility into significant revenue growth for 2022. Additionally, we recently announced several strategic acquisitions that will accelerate our new powering and Smarter World strategy and provide additional avenues for growth as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 34% to $943 million, an all-time record and also increased sequentially relative to the second quarter, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by strength in both residential and C&I products as compared to the prior year. Residential product growth was led by a 50% increase in shipments of home standby generators as production levels continue to increase significantly relative to prior year levels as well as tremendous year-over-year growth in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems, which also grew double digits on a sequential basis.
Shipments of C&I products were also up dramatically in the quarter with revenue of these products now growing materially above 2019 levels due to strength across a number of end markets and geographies. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.2% were lower as compared to the prior year as they were unfavorably impacted by higher logistics and commodity costs. In response to the escalating costs we are experiencing, we have undertaken a number of additional pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the longer-term impact to margins.
Now discussing our third quarter results in more detail. The megatrends driving consumer interest in backup power continued in the third quarter. Most notably, the Home as a Sanctuary trend, combined with more extreme weather, which again resulted in elevated power outage activity. Overall, baseline outage activity for the trailing 4 quarters grew on a year-over-year basis in the quarter despite a very strong prior year comparison and remains well above the long-term baseline average. In fact, since we began tracking the impact of outage activity more than a decade ago, 4 of the top 10 power outage severity quarters have occurred since the second half of last year. The convergence of the heightened power outage activity broader electrification trends and people spending more time at home has driven unprecedented demand for home standby generators. As a result, home consultations or sales leads, increased again at a strong double-digit rate in the third quarter over the robust prior year comparison, and broad-based growth continues to be experienced as almost all U.S. regions grew on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. It's also relevant to note that home consultations in the third quarter increased over 3x the comparable 2019 levels, and on a year-to-date basis more than 4x 2019 levels.
Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. We continue to experience a strong expansion of our distribution footprint as we ended the third quarter with approximately 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of 1,100 dealers over the last 12 months. California and Texas alone continue to account for nearly 1/3 of the year-over-year increase. Early in the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. We continue to make encouraging progress increasing production levels for home standby generators across our operating footprint with daily build rates much higher compared to prior year levels. Despite the higher output, demand for home standby generators continues to outpace our ability to produce them, which has caused lead times to further grow to approximately 30 weeks. These significant lead times provide excellent visibility as we head into 2022, with our home standby backlog projected to be well over $1 billion entering the next year.
As we consider the longer-term capacity requirements for home standby production, we have made a number of strategic decisions to further expand our footprint. Yesterday, we announced plans to expand warehousing and distribution capacity at our Trenton facility by adding 200,000 square feet, which will increase the current size of the building by nearly 50%. In addition, we recently made commitments to purchase additional long lead time automated manufacturing equipment that would be available to come online in 2023, further increasing our capacity for several key components to provide for needed search production as the category continues to grow. In addition to these capacity expansion actions, last week, we introduced the industry's largest air-cooled home standby generator, our new 26-kilowatt unit. Building upon the success of the launch of our 24-kilowatt unit last year, the new 26-kilowatt unit will allow homeowners to access the kind of power only previously available in larger sized, liquid cool generators at a significantly lower cost. As the trend to decarbonize accelerates, the electrification of everything in the home, including heating, cooking, cleaning and ultimately, transportation will lead to much greater residential electricity consumption.
The new 26-kilowatt home standby unit will be capable of providing the kind of resiliency needed with these larger electrical loads and will provide an ability to future proof of home as these electrification trends intensify in the years ahead. With the strong outage environment and mega trends like Home as a Sanctuary underpinning tremendous demand for home standby generators, those same factors, along with the increasing penetration of solar installations are also driving rapid growth for our clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew significantly as compared to the prior year and also grew at a double-digit rate sequentially.
Despite numerous supply chain challenges also impacting clean energy products, we continue to experience growth well above the broader U.S. residential solar market, driven by ongoing increases in storage attachment rates and continued market share gains. In addition to strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy products continue to show favorable trends. Home consultations expanded as compared to the prior year and accelerated throughout the quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, more than doubled in the third quarter as compared to the prior year and also increased sequentially. In addition, we further built out our installer network as we entered the third quarter with approximately 2,300 trained and certified dealers with nearly 1,000 of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay's e-sales platform. Despite the industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges, we expect clean energy revenues to approximately double for full year 2021 on a year-over-year basis.
In addition, we continue to drive profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain. Building on the early success we've experienced with our clean energy product offering, we formally announced several exciting new clean energy-related products during the third quarter that we believe will further grow our competitive advantage in this exciting new market. We introduced the industry's first purpose-built dedicated battery charging generator during the quarter, the power generator, which is a one-of-a-kind power product, enabling a homeowner to create a solar plus storage system that is completely grid-independent. We also introduced our new Power Manager Load Control System that maximizes battery performance and offers homeowners the ability to control specific electric loads from a mobile device via our existing PowerView energy monitoring platform. And building off the early integration success with the recent Chilicon acquisition, we introduced the Power Micro, a Generac-branded microinverter that allows us to fully participate in the residential solar only market, a meaningful expansion beyond the solar plus storage space we previously addressed.
In another example of our focus on continued innovation, we announced the acquisition of Apricity, an advanced engineering and product design company focused on developing energy technology solutions. The team at Apricity brings expertise in designing and prototyping energy-related products to increase reliability, add functionality and improve performance. The company has also developed a unique smart water heater controller that is used as a grid edge device by utilities and demand response and other energy conservation programs. Bringing this talented group on board will accelerate our efforts in expanding our clean energy offerings and increase our speed to market for key clean energy and grid services products and solutions.
To further build upon Generac evolution into an energy technology solutions company, yesterday, we announced an exciting agreement to acquire ecobee, which accelerates our capability to provide a home energy ecosystem with a dual-value proposition for both homeowners and grid operators. Ecobee is a pioneer in the smart thermostat market. and offers a full line of intelligent thermostats and home monitoring products that deliver significant energy savings, security and peace of mind and enable the monitoring and control of a significant portion of the home's electrical load. Residential HVAC systems represent the single largest energy-consuming device in the home today, and ecobee has created an intelligent system using smart thermostats and sensors to effectively balance comfort and conservation.
With over 5 million connected devices in more than 2 million homes, ecobee customers in North America have saved more than 20 terawatts of energy, which is the equivalent of saving enough energy to take all the homes in Los Angeles off the grid for an entire year. Importantly, ecobee adds to Generac's growing suite of residential power generation, energy storage and energy management solutions that we believe will play a pivotal role in helping to solve the challenges of the growing supply and demand imbalances of today's electrical grid. Smart thermostat controls represent one of the largest opportunities within the grid services addressable market, involving the connection of grid edge devices to a grid services platform like our Concerto software platform, thereby enabling participation in grid services programs. Adding ecobee's devices to our product portfolio considerably expands our served market opportunity and increases our capabilities to provide end-to-end solutions for turnkey virtual power plant projects. Adding ecobee's innovative team of over 500 employees gives us the ability to further advance the development of an intelligent and intuitive user interface platform that would integrate and synchronize our generation and storage equipment and our existing Grid Edge devices providing seamless access and control for homeowners through a smartphone tablet or PC. We believe this approach will create one of the broadest home energy ecosystems available on the market today and allow for easy connection to our concert platform empowering homeowners to make smarter energy production, storage and consumption decisions while providing grid operators more efficient access to the home in aggregate or at the device level for grid support programs.
I'd also like to provide a brief update on Generac Rig Services, a new group within Generac that was formed in the third quarter that builds upon our October 2020 acquisition of Enbala Power Networks. Generic Grid Services was established to directly engage and serve utilities, energy retailers and grid operators to provide an array of solutions and enable entirely new value streams that leverage a range of products from our portfolio. We took another major step toward unlocking significant value in the grid services space in the third quarter with the formal announcement of smart grid ready capabilities across our home standby generators, our C&I natural gas generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems.
In addition to the peace of mind that they're receiving from Generac products, customers now have the opportunity to also obtain additional return on investment by leveraging their products to support grid reliability, resiliency and sustainability. Within the expanding grid services marketplace, we believe Generac Grid Services is a unique and differentiated market leader due to our comprehensive set of hardware plus software plus services offerings, including through our smart grid ready capabilities for legacy products, our recent acquisition of Apricity smart water heater controllers and our pending acquisition of ecobee and its home energy management solutions. Our increasing integration of hardware with grid software and services is leading to a number of contract wins, along with a significant increase in proposal requests and an overall expanding sales pipeline. These include several examples of the new revenue streams within our grid services model as we layer on higher-value turnkey virtual power plant programs utilizing Generac hardware and performance contracts on top of the Concerto Software as a Service platform.
We are in the very early innings of the evolution of the power grid. But as consumer awareness grows and demand from utilities and grid operators materializes, we remain incredibly excited about the potential long-term growth trajectory of Generac Grid Services. The excitement around our expanding energy technology solution capabilities extends into the C&I product range as well. We're offerings such as Energy as a Service, microgrid solutions and mobile energy storage systems are helping drive the long-term growth trajectory and an increasing mix of energy technology revenues. Our core C&I business experienced strong momentum in the third quarter as a number of end markets and geographies continue to recover strongly off the COVID weakened prior year quarter. Specifically, C&I product sales grew 47% as compared to the prior year, and 31% on a core basis. We also have a considerable backlog that is growing for C&I products that provides good visibility for meaningful growth heading into 2022.
In addition to strong quoting and order activity in our North American distributor channel, shipments to telecom national account customers increased dramatically again during the quarter as compared to the prior year as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers continued at elevated levels and have led to further increase in project shipments during the current year. The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications. We also experienced very strong growth within our national account -- national rental account customers as shipments of mobile products continue to recover at a significant rate of the COVID-driven lows of 2020. We still expect shipments of mobile products to improve dramatically for the full year 2021 as the prior year -- as national rental account customers invest heavily in fleet equipment with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve. We remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products given the important mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could benefit from the potential economic stimulus plans being pursued through the federal infrastructure spending bill.
Additionally, we continue to build great momentum with our C&I beyond standby initiatives. We are experiencing ongoing strength in project quoting for our natural gas generators using applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in Energy as a Service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation applications. During the third quarter, we announced a 5-year agreement with Enchanted Rock to build and supply the advanced natural gas generators and control systems that are used in ultra-low emission dual-purpose microgrids that Enchanted Rock designs and operates. These solutions provide commercial, industrial and governmental customers with affordable and reliable backup power and supply electric grid operators with critical grid stability services that accelerate the adoption of wind and solar without sacrificing overall grid reliability.
The microgrid solutions are based on Generac's rich burn gaseous engine technology and our newly acquired deep sea electronics control systems, which provides quick start, utility-grade backup power in a much cleaner format when compared to traditional diesel generator solutions. We remain very optimistic regarding customer and grid operator interest in beyond standby applications, of our C&I natural gas generators. It's being driven by the need for enhanced grid stability and resiliency that these large blocks of power can offer as well as the tangible and meaningful return on the investment opportunity for asset owners. Our international business continues to see strong momentum as well with net sales growth of 61% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter and 32% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the deep sea and off-grid energy acquisitions, and the impact of favorable foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all major regions that continue to experience a sharp increase in demand off the prior year COVID lows and have also recovered well above 2019 levels.
Larger project quoting and overall order activity continued to recover at a strong pace in key international markets, which drove growth in our international backlog during the third quarter with the order strength continuing thus far in the fourth quarter. In addition, the segment's third quarter EBITDA margin expanded to 14.1% from 7.9% in the year ago period due to the higher margin profile impact from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and improved operating leverage in the base business on higher sales volumes. With regards to Off Grid Energy, this acquisition closed on September 1 and brings a diverse range of energy storage solutions that provide cleaner and more flexible energy for industrial and mobile applications. Off Grid provides us an entry point into the rapidly growing market for industrial grade energy storage systems and accelerates our hybrid generator and C&I energy storage product road map. Off Grid continues to see robust demand for its products in its core European markets, and we're working to bring these solutions to the rest of our geographic footprint given our strong global relationships with rental equipment customers. Our integration efforts are off to a strong start with some legacy customers across Europe having already placed orders for Off Grid products, highlighting early momentum in the sales synergies that we expect to realize.
In closing today, we have tremendous momentum in our business as we close out the current year and head into 2022 with incredible home standby demand and expanding energy technology solutions portfolio, a growing grid services sales pipeline and strong global demand for our C&I products. This provides support for yet another year of significant revenue growth with recent pricing and cost initiatives driving an improving margin profile. Day-to-day execution and navigation of the supply chain challenges clearly remains a near-term priority for our teams. But we're also keeping a clear focus on our new long-term powering a smarter world strategy with our ultimate purpose to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Through the combination of aggressive organic investment and a series of strategic acquisitions over the past 3 years, Generac is uniquely positioned with our products, our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise to deliver the solutions necessary to facilitate the transition to the next-generation electrical grid. Importantly, we retained significant financial flexibility to further invest and expand our capabilities and continue to advance our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on third quarter results and our updated outlook. York?"

The combination of contribu",2124,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 34% to $942.7 million during the third quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $701.4 million in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from the Mean Green, Enbala, Deep Sea Chilecon and Off Grid acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales grew to $608.8 million as compared to $458.9 million in the prior year, representing a 33% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth advancing by 50% during the third quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products despite challenging supply chain headwinds. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as storage attachment rates and market share gains continue to drive growth of Generac clean energy solutions. This growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments of portable generators, which faced a strong prior year comparison from a record level of shipments to the Hurricane Eisai in the prior year.
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the third quarter of 2021 increased 47% to $258.3 million as compared to $176.2 million in the prior year quarter. There was an approximate 15% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions along with the favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was in part aided by the soft prior year comparison due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, C&I revenue also grew approximately 7% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels. The strength in core sales was driven by growth across a number of end markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a strong rate, both domestically and internationally in the following areas.
Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers due to much higher capital spending levels from these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks and prepare for 5G rollouts. Also contributing to the increase was strong growth from mobile products to our rental channel customers as they are investing heavily in their fleets due to higher utilization and rental rates. We also experienced higher shipments of natural gas generators used in beyond standby applications. Internationally, the increase in C&I products was broad-based from a geographic standpoint, most notably in Europe and Latin America as these markets continue to experience a sharp increase in demand of the prior year COVID lows and have recovered well above 2019 levels.
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 14% to $75.6 million as compared to $66.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 4% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. Heightened power outage activity over the past several quarters continues to drive strong growth in aftermarket service parts. A larger and growing installed base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 35.6% compared to 39.4% in the prior year third quarter as higher input costs had a significant unfavorable impact during the quarter. Specifically, rising commodity prices, labor rates and logistics costs, along with the Trenton plant start-up, all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The early impact of pricing actions partially offset these margin pressures, with the full impact expected to be realized throughout 2022 as these price increases work through our backlog.
Operating expenses increased $41.9 million or 34.8% as compared to the third quarter of 2020 but declined 13 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the substantially higher sales volumes on the current year quarter. The increase in OpEx dollars was primarily driven by additional variable expenses from a significant increase in sales volume, higher employee costs and marketing spend and the impact of acquisitions. Specifically, recurring OpEx from the Mean Green, Enbala, Deep Sea, Chilocon, Apricity and Off Grid acquisitions, related higher amortization expense and incremental transaction costs during the current year quarter.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $209.2 million or 22.2% of net sales as compared to $178.8 million or 25.5% of net sales in the prior year. This EBITDA margin decrease was largely driven by the aforementioned decline in gross margin.
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reportable segments. Domestic segment sales increased 30% to $791 million as compared to $607 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 1% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $187.7 million, representing a 23.7% margin as compared to $171.4 million in the prior year or 28.2% of net sales. International segment sales increased 61% to $152 million as compared to $94 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 32% compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $21.5 million or 14.1% of net sales as compared to $7.4 million or 7.9% of net sales in the prior year. The strong growth in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to the favorable impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, and incremental operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $131.6 million as compared to $115 million for the third quarter of 2020.
GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $32.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% as compared to $32.1 million or an effective tax rate of 21.8% for the prior year. The decline in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item resulting from a higher stock compensation deduction during the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.93 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.82 for the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $151.1 million in the current year quarter or $2.35 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $132.9 million in the prior year or $2.08 per share.
Cash income taxes for the third quarter of 2021 were $31.3 million as compared to $23.6 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20% to 20.5% for the full year 2021 compared to our previous expectation of approximately 21% to 21.5%. The decrease is primarily driven by a higher-than-expected level of stock compensation deduction. This expected full year cash tax rate compared to the prior year rate of 16% that was anticipated after the third quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate.
Cash flow from operations was $74 million as compared to $155 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $42 million as compared to $148 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a higher working capital investment in the current year quarter and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings versus prior year. The higher working capital investment was driven by elevated inventory at the end of the current year quarter resulting from extended logistics in transit timing, continued supply chain constraints, ramping production rates and the start-up of our new Trenton, South Carolina facility.
Updating our liquidity position as of September 30, 2021, we had $873 million of liquidity comprised of $424 million of cash on hand and $449 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter was $910 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was only 1.1x on an as-reported basis.
Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months at $455 million. I would now like to provide some additional details on our outlook for full year 2021. As mentioned in our press release earlier this morning, we are maintaining our full year 2021 net sales growth guidance range of approximately 47% to 50% compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 5% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. The expected benefit from acquisitions is moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the Off Grid Energy, Tank Utility and ecobee acquisitions not included in our previous guidance.
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021. As we've discussed, we are continuing to experience significant supply chain challenges, logistics delays and rising commodity prices, which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance. As a result of these factors, we now expect gross margin for the full year '21 to decline approximately 150 basis points as compared to the prior year, which compares to the previous expectation of approximately flat versus the prior year. Due to the reduced gross margin outlook, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 23.5%, which compares to the previous guidance of 24.5% to 25%. As a result, we expect to maintain EBITDA margins compared to the prior year despite the significant margin headwinds and acquisitions executed during the current year.
Providing some quick comments regarding our initial thoughts looking into 2022, the company's consolidated backlog has increased considerably since reporting our second quarter results, most notably for home standby generators, but also across a broad range of other residential and C&I product categories. For example, and as Aaron mentioned, our home standby backlog alone is projected to be well over $1 billion entering the new year. The substantial overall backlog expected at the end of this year provides support for another year of projected significant revenue growth in 2022 with an improving margin profile as we begin to realize the full impact of various pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives.
Throughout 2021, we have implemented multiple rounds of price increases across all product categories with different realization lags depending on lead times. We expect increasing realization of all 2021 pricing actions throughout the first half of 2022, with the full benefit realized by the second half of 2022. We also are pursuing certain cost reduction initiatives to combat the significant increased input costs, including important projects focused on profitability enhancement and continuous improvement activities.
We will now provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be between 20% to 20.5%, which compares to prior guidance of 21% to 21.5%. GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecasted to be approximately $45 million to $47 million as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $49 million, with the decrease primarily due to updated purchase accounting adjustments related to recent acquisitions. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $26 million to $27 million as compared to previous guidance of $24 million, primarily due to the impact of additional acquisitions since our second quarter update. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22% to 22.5% for the full year compared to the previous guidance range of 22.5% to 23.5%. The decline is primarily due to a higher level of stock compensation deduction during the current year.
Our fourth quarter weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 64.5 million shares, assuming a December 1 closing of the ecobee transaction. This concludes our prepared remarks at this time. We'd like to open up the call for questions."

Thanks for the question on that, Tommy. Ecobee is going to be -- I think we'll look back a couple of years from now, and that's going to be a really critical turning point for us as we continue on this journey, the evolution we talk about any way of becoming an energy technology company. Specific to your question on distribution, what we really like about them is that they refer to their go-to-market or their distribution strategy as omnichannel, which is exactly how we would refer to our own.
They sell through retailers, big-box retailers, they sell online on those platforms. They sell through dealers. They have over 40,000 HVAC contractors that represent them in the marketplace. So really a pretty wide net in terms of just the way they go to market. They sell to distributors, HVAC distributors. So it's really truly omnichannel. So we like that. It fits well. We think there's going to be a lot of interesting synergies there. Our electrical channel can certainly install a thermostat. And conversely, their trades can install some of our other products as well. So we think there's a really good fit there. The thermostat market, if you just look at thermostats, the definition, you're right, it's a pretty big market. This is truly, I would say, beyond that, though. This is about the intelligent thermostat platform and the smart thermostat platform. And there really are only a handful of true competitors to what ecobee does. Ecobee created this category. Basically, Stewart Lombard, great the person who runs that business up there, a great entrepreneur began that business in 2007.
And by 2009, they had introduced the market's first true smart thermostat. And others have joined, you're right. But I think what -- when we think about our differentiation going forward, the combination of the smart thermostat as just one of the elements of -- is what we keep referring to as a home energy ecosystem, right? This is more than just a thermostat. It's more than just a water heater controller. It's more than just a single storage device or solar on the rooftop or a generator right, or a load management device. This is about the integration of all of those things. And what we really like about ecobee is it gives us a platform and it gives us a team of over 500 people up in Toronto that are steeped in user interfaces and user experience that is what we need to bring all of these assets together to combine them in a single pane of glass for view and control by the consumer and then for easy attachment to grid programs through our concert platform. So we think that this is kind of the middle layer that is -- it's much more than just a thermostat. It's the middle layer that we need going forward to bring all of this stuff to bear as the grid continues to change and as the home energy ecosystem continues to develop.
So we're -- I'm just really excited about this. It is a cool product. If you've ever look at the product itself and just the quality of it, the premium look, fit and finish of the product itself and the platform, if you ever use the ecobee platform, it's definitely, I think, going to be a really cool platform to put all of our devices into."

As a follow-up, I wanted to talk to your HSB business, where recently at the Investor Day, you gave some directional insight on really favorable cost per lead trends. So you're still supply constrained there, notwithstanding some major efforts to alleviate that bottleneck.

But I think we've got our arms around some really good longer-term plans here to continue to expand capacity. All the things that we have been working on that will come online next year. And then we made some pretty big commitments here in the third quarter, very recently, around not only the expansion of the Trenton facility, which I think is an important commitment, but commitments towards additional automated manufacturing equipment to help us scale even further there. But your question is a good one.
I would tell you that our marketing team watches the statistics very closely. And if they were to see the cost per lead starting to change, right, around where we're spending and where we're deploying dollars, they would throttle back the spending. And so far, that really hasn't been the case. So I think what people sometimes don't realize is  this -- a home standby generator project was already kind of a long term -- it was a longer, I would say, project time line for most people because there's permitting involved, there's contractors involved. You have the work itself, you have inspectors. Clearly, it wasn't 7 months before. But it generally was 2, 3 months. And I think people realize in today's environment that we are supply constrained on a lot of things, not just home standby generators, appliances, vehicles, you name it, and it's tough to find things today. So I think there's, call it, an acceptance level, I don't know what it is, but I think people are somewhat accepting of the fact that they have to wait.
And I think it also speaks to just how in tune people are with the importance of having backup power. The outages have been increasing. They've been lasting longer. I think people are spending a ton more time in their homes, and they realize just how vulnerable they are. And what that means to the ability to work from home, their kids ability to learn from home, all the things that we need to do from home only happen with a continuous source of power. So I think a generator is just going to be -- it's going to be an appliance that we all have here going forward. We're going to need that as the grid continues to change. And that's why we're committed to expanding our capacity. We've got a lot of confidence in where this is going longer term. And I think that as it relates to marketing dollars, we're going to continue to spend there, too, as long as it makes sense financially."

Maybe just on the backlog, I think directionally, you're thinking about it right.

We're hitting record output levels on HSP. We could go higher if not for some of the -- and a lot of our constraints here are pure logistics related. I mean just the nuttiness of getting components from point A to point B right now, just the amount of dwell time that's going on with components in the ports and trying to find trucks, everything else you've heard about from every single company in America, we're no different.
And that is -- that's kind of holding us back a bit. But we think that's temporary. That will resolve. We're confident that we'll get our feet under us as a country here around getting our supply chains repaired. But directionally, you're right. I think that the real question is, we talked about this double-double in terms of our capacity. That's theoretical capacity. If the supply chain constraints persist into the first half of next year, that could obviously create some headwinds, right, to what we originally thought of in terms of ultimate theoretical capacity. So that's something we've got to watch. Longer term, again, we feel like we've got a good plan to go even higher, to go even further with home standby capacity. We've got the confidence to do that. I think you may have hit on something that that's really important here is in the distribution network in terms of installation. We have 8,100 dealers today. We're growing that number. We've grown 1,100 dealers over the last 12 months, the most in any last 12-month period we've ever grown, and we're going to need to grow a lot more.
The reality of it is we're going to have to pick up the pace of installations so that we can keep pace as we deliver more products going into next year. Now remember that dealers aren't the only people who do installations. Installations are also done generally by contractors. There's over 70,000 electrical contractors out there, and there's over 100,000 HVAC contractors. And both of those trades do HSB installations. So it's beyond just our dealers. They do the lion's share, but but it's also other trades that are involved who may not be dealers for us. So we have a pretty wide availability of contractors, but we really need to do a lot more training. We need to find more dealers. And we've got a, I would say, an outsized effort and outsized focus on that for next year. I don't know, York, if there's any additional comments you want to make I think you hit on."

The one coming up here, that probably won't realize till, let's say, July, given our lead times. So I think -- and then you look at other products, we're also -- we've rolled out pricing as well. So I think I would say by the end of the first half of 2022, we'll get full realization of all of our pricing.

So getting pricing to realize, we are somewhat constrained there just because of the outsized demand for HSB in particular. But then also, I would say, our cost lags, if you will, have shortened because we're burning through material so much quicker. The pace of production is increasing at such a volatile pace where I think lags of increases in the past with commodities and other things might have taken us a while longer to get through and start to show and read through in the EBITDA margins or even the gross margins, they're reading through quicker right now.

Yes, capacity at HSP, let's just kind of run through a couple of things in your question. So the expansion of Trenton first. So that expansion add 200,000 square feet to that facility, that is really about warehousing and distribution. So I wouldn't say it would impact our double-double at all. What it is representative of is our confidence that we're going to be able to run at an elevated rate down there for an extended period of time. We would have had to do the warehousing and distribution end of that with 3PLs. By bringing in-house, we just we get a nice payback on that project pretty quickly. So that just made a lot of sense and I think is indicative of kind of the longer-term feelings that we have about not only Trenton, we like the facility, we like the labor pool but also just the category, home standby in general.
Now on the additional capacity that we talked about on our prepared remarks, with the long lead time automated manufacturing equipment, really, what's going on there is, as we've talked, Phil, we have some internal components we manufacture that -- of which the tooling to make that equipment has just gotten crazy long. I mean we're talking 60 to 70 weeks long in terms of ordering the equipment and getting it delivered and starting to run it off. So what we're doing there is we're basically saying, look, we have confidence in the category. We have confidence in the demand we're seeing. Let's get our tooling on order. We don't even know where we're going to put the tooling, right? We're not exactly sure if it's going to go in maybe another expansion of Trenton or maybe the -- maybe we squeeze it into White Water or maybe we put it into Jefferson and I'll address that here in a second or maybe it's a whole other facility. We don't really know yet.
What we do know is it will allow us to go further than the double-double that we talked about, right? So it gets us set up to do that. So now we start the rest of the ground game that has to get done there around supply chain, around all the other elements that have to fall into place. And we'll be able to provide more color on that as we get closer to it, but we just -- we felt like we had to take the first step here, given the lead times on that equipment, we just wanted to get -- make sure that we got ahead of it, and we didn't want to get in a situation where we couldn't react. So we're kind of putting our markers down for the future there.
And then on Jefferson, you're right, we kind of took a facility where we're making portable generators, power washers, core products. And we've added capacity for HSP. We added another production line there here recently in the third quarter. So we're producing more out of Jefferson and we anticipate producing more as we end the year here. If you recall, we mentioned that we're going to the outside for some key components that we normally manufacture. So we spooled up some components on the outside. Those are going to start to be delivered here in the back half of the fourth quarter, and they're going to go to Jefferson where they're going to help us increase capacity there. Whether or not we continue to do that long term, I think we're going to continue to do it for the foreseeable future, for certain the next 12 months. I think all of '22 will be producing HSB in Jefferson and likely into 2023, depending on kind of what kind of backlog, if we're able to knock the backlog out next year, which is looking less and less likely, just given where the demand is. I mean it just keeps coming every day. It's amazing. And so where that demand ends up, where we may end up for the year of 2022 will kind of dictate how we feel about '23. And then some of that will be about where we put that new tooling as well. So more to come on that, but definitely taking the next steps that we think we need to be able to go far beyond that existing double-double that we've talked about for capacity on HSB."

So they're about probably closer to $125 million in revs and that's supply chain constrain, to your point on chips, they could be going higher than that, but they do have, as you would imagine, some supply chain constraints there. They're working through those like we all are. And we're adding additional chip capacity across that product line. Stuart and his team are doing a nice job of navigating that. Their growth rate is going to be about 3x the Generac growth rate as we laid it out in the LRP model for the Investor Day. So they've got a lot of aggressive growth on the table. That's not only devices, but it's also services. So pretty exciting. That's a lot of growth coming out of the services piece going forward.
But no, it's actually -- I kind of call it a start-up that's kind of getting to scale. They've been around 14 years, and they spent a lot of time getting to this point and they've really started to see an inflection here in the last couple of years. They are still in investment mode, so they're generating operating losses today, and will continue to do so. We're going to continue that investment cycle over the next couple of years. It's probably going to be a couple of years before they're breakeven. So -- but that doesn't worry us. We think it's an important investment to continue to make, not only around their existing platforms around the home energy monitoring, but also, again, around integration and synchronization of all of our assets that are part of our home energy ecosystem going forward."

We're actually pacing pretty well with the existing equipment that's been on order. The new equipment that we've ordered here recently and committed to part of the reason why that equipment is out longer on lead times is due to some component shortages. There's -- these are automated systems. So there's a lot of logic in them, a lot of chips, and they're struggling with that. But the existing systems that we're bringing on here in Q1 and Q2 of next year are still holding in there in terms of the time line. So we feel good about that. No material delays there. The rest of the supply chain challenges whether it be building out the Trenton facility or some of the other things that we're trying to do here, I think we've effectively kind of -- We built that into our assumptions around the timing of when those things will become meaningful to us or when they'll come online.
It's really the near-term true component supply chain that's been just that really deteriorated in the third quarter. When we sat there even when we talked to everybody at our Investor Day, I mean, just what it did from the end of kind of the middle to the end of September to the end of October was disappointing, right? Just the amount of ships that anchor on the West Coast, just the trucking challenges, the rail challenges, the port challenges, the amount of additional time it's taking to get things here. Forget about the cost to get it here, which is mind numbing as well, but the time. It's really the time factor to get it here. I'm really hopeful that, that's going to start to turn around here over the next the next 60 days I'm hoping are going to be better. We're hearing indications that perhaps things have bottomed on that side in terms of just where they've been. And hopefully, that will improve on a go-forward basis.

We're going to broaden that supply chain out so that we believe we've got enough supply to get going on that next year.
But as we're starting to take a look at our plan for next year, we're kind of sitting there stepping back and saying, look, there's a lot of people that have interest in these products. And we are setting up to have a pretty healthy position on supply. So we got to put all that together when we put our 2022 guidance together formally. But I would say the initial receptivity continues to be strong. Our project remains online and on target.

I think that's a pretty, frankly, myopic view of what we're getting into. What we're getting into is the home energy ecosystem. And it's -- look, HVAC represents the largest energy load in the home today. that may change in the future with electrification of our transportation. But today, it's the largest electrical load and the largest energy load in the home. You combine that with our generation capabilities, whether it be PV generation or whether it's using a natural gas generator with storage, with our load management, with thermostatic control, water heater control, right, water heater is another massive load in the home. You start looking across that spectrum you could see very quickly, Joe, where it makes a ton of sense for us to include ecobee thermostats or other grid edge devices with somebody who might be looking at a storage system or solar plus storage.
Because when you think about it in the context of the total amount of money they're going to spend on that system, frankly, the grid edge devices being thermostats and water heater controllers and load management controls, they're relatively small, but they add a tremendous amount of value in rounding out the value proposition not only for the homeowner but also, again, for the grid operator. I think that's where it gets really interesting is what we can do with that through our Concerto platform. So anyway, we're taking a really long view at this, but it's an exciting view of the world kind of in the future grid 2.0 context that I think you've got to step back and you've got to kind of see where the puck is going here, and that's kind of what we're doing with this acquisition."

The demand has outstripped here over the last in the more recent period here as we ended Q3 and as we have come into Q4, it's just -- it's odd to me -- I mean -- and we really have had -- October for the most part, was a pretty quiet month on outages, but the demand has been continuing just to be off the charts.
I mean there's really no 2 ways to say it. I mean everything from our leading indicators like ICs to our lagging indicators like activations and then obviously, the incoming orders that are outstripping our kind of record production levels here. It just -- the setup there is -- and it's clear to us. As we continue to kind of peel back the onion on why that is, that the Home as a Sanctuary trend, the electrification of everything, the concern about just power security, power reliability, these things are real. These things are driving people to solutions like home standby generators and clean energy storage devices. And we're coming to a point of realization, I think that -- And it's why we made the comments about our commitments to the longer-term home standby capacity increases because we just feel like this is -- we're maybe at a tipping point here with this category, where we're just shy of what 6% penetration, I think, today and the acceleration on that is phenomenal. We could be entering a period here where this is something that we think about as -- that every home has to have. And there's a lot in between 6% and saying something that every home has to have. Remember, every 1% is $2.5 billion. So every 1% of penetration is $2.5 billion of market, and we're over 75% share in the space. So it's good math, right? I mean it's just -- it's a great setup, but we've got to be prepared for it. everything from the ability to produce these products to the ability to install and service the product.
So there's going to be a tremendous amount of focus there has been trends mount of focus so far but there needs to be a lot more focus by us going forward on all those areas so that we're ready for this so that we can enable this because the secular things that we're seeing out here causing it, we don't see changing anytime soon.

We were a little bit more vocal on that at this time because we continue to gain confidence based on, honestly, just the sheer number of proposals in our pipeline. It's changed dramatically in the 1 year that we've owned Enbala. The Concerto platform, they just did their latest release of the platform that adds additional functionality that adds, again, the smart grid ready capability to our products. We've added here initially the home standby generators, C&I gas generators, our PWRcell systems, even our PWRmanager, the load management device, we're making all of those smart grid ready.
And as we see more proposals coming in, it gets us more and more excited about the opportunity to connect those assets through Concerto to these grid operators to be able to participate in these programs. I will tell you that there is still this -- I don't want to say it's a missing link, but there's the connection process of the marketing process, right, of going out to a utilities rate payers and saying, okay, we can walk in today. We've got this. We demonstrated here at the Investor Day. You guys may have remembered back in our labs here, we showed our our map, if you will, of the U.S. and where we can zoom in on all of the assets we have on the ground, these distributed energy resources, be they generators or be they storage systems or load management devices. And now going forward ecobee products like thermostats and sensors, we're going to put all of that into the map, but we can go to a local utility, and we can have a conversation with them that's much more than just, hey, tell us about your needs. We can go in there and we can say, hey, did you know that you have this many hundreds of megawatts available to you in your market that could be connected. It's on the ground today. These assets are there.
And so -- and that's just -- it's stunning. The amount of information that provides to these utilities, they have no idea. They have no idea that this exists today. It's not something you have to do in the future. it's something they have today. The next question is, okay, how do we connect it? How do we reach those consumers that own those assets and enroll them into the platform and then get them on these programs? So each utility is a little different, as you know. Some utilities move a little faster than others. Today, we're in pilot on a number of programs with some utilities around taking existing generator owners or existing PWRcell owners or new PWRcell owners and marketing to them the opportunity to enroll that asset. If they've already got it installed, great. If they don't, they can buy one, get it installed and get it enrolled. We're going through pilot on a number of these programs, and we're already exercising control. We're giving the utilities control over these pilot programs. And they're very excited about what they think they can do and what they think it means to the way they operate their grids in the future.
Look, they have their backs against the wall, right? They are being mandated to -- and we all want to do this. We want to decarbonize our energy use. And that decarbonization is going to come from putting more renewables on the supply side. But with that comes more instability, right? So you talk about the change in the grid. There's the 3Ds, right, decarbonization, digitization and decentralization. That's what the new grid is going to look like. The pace that we're going to get there, though, creates a fourth D, create some destabilization potentially, right? So some instability around these renewables that are online that maybe are not as predictable for baseload usage. So what we have to do is we've got to give new tools to grid operators to solve for this challenge. A grid operator's entire day is consumed by figuring out how to keep supply and demand in balance. And that's exactly what the Concerto platform does. That's why we continue to add more grid assets like ecobee into our mix because we think that the more assets we can deliver to these grid operators and utilities the more value as a partner we're going to bring. And certainly, more value we're going to bring to the homeowner in terms of them being able to control and optimize their energy consumption. So really exciting future around that, but it's really all about grid services down the line. And that's why we talk more about it today."

I mean, the interest level in particular, on home standby which picked up. We saw that very broadly as well with Home as a Sanctuary last year. We saw interest outside the U.S. pick up far beyond anything we had seen previously for the category. And so -- but you're right, we're supply constrained. That's the unfortunate side of things. But we're still getting product over there. We're up dramatically in what we're delivering to Europe. It's still very small as a base, but it's growing very quickly. Storage is another area. We think that we have an opportunity there.
It's probably a little bit further out as we deliver on some modifications to our existing PWRcell system. We'll have a new system coming out in 2023, and that system is probably going to be a little bit better fit for some of the European applications. But we are looking at how we might go after that market more aggressively here because it's going to take it's going to take some time to get our distribution and our go-to-market approach under us there. So working on that. I will point out the Off Grid acquisition that we did is all about what's going on in Europe, right, with storage in general on the C&I side, we're seeing a lot of opportunities there certainly in the rental markets to provide storage for the different applications there, whether it be entertainment applications or construction applications or things like that, where clearly, the high cost of diesel fuel and even the availability in some cases, the fuel in general, is causing challenges.
So we're seeing storage systems like the Off Grid systems become a lot more popular. That asset is in the short period of time we've owned it, just the order book there has been really fun to kind of watch that grow as those products get introduced. We introduced them to our legacy channel partners there. But yes, Europe represents a huge market opportunity. We're going to stay focused on it, but I'd love to say that we're going to be able to do something more there next year, but we got a tiger about a tail here in North America as well."

There's certainly some component, as I said, our ability to ramp to the theoretical capacity numbers we talked about for next year, midyear next year, may be somewhat constrained by supply chain in the short term. We still think that's probably maybe a first half '22 story and then should abate. But I would say we're more constrained right now just based on the inability to just go beyond what -- as we get the up the learning curve here in Trenton and as we put a second line on in Jefferson and then as we go into next year with the new tooling that's going to get delivered there, that's just kind of the pacing of getting to those levels that we've talked about. And certainly, some supply chain constraints today causing that. But I would say it's more just demand outstripping. Even if we were able to produce at max capacity today, I fear that demand would be outstripping that given where we're at. So it's more -- I think it's more of that than it is supply chain constraints."

We have done a lot of acquisitions this year. We've done 6 of them with the ecobee acquisition was #6 this year. That's a lot for us.

We've done 6 of them with the ecobee acquisition was #6 this year. That's a lot for us. And I don't think we started the year, we didn't set out the year to do 6. Acquisition timing, what we've learned over the years of doing -- I think we've done something like 23 or 24 deals now. That -- the timing of those deals, we generally don't dictate that. It's generally dictated by sellers or dictated by market processes, things like that. So it just happened that this year, we got 6 that came to us. We have a really strong team here. And thankfully, the acquisitions have actually been spread out nicely across our C&I business, across our residential business, across our clean energy businesses. So the teams have been able to absorb them.
I think they haven't all been in 1 particular part of our business, which I think is good. In fact, some of them were international, right, like the Off Grid acquisition and Deep Sea, those acquisitions are being handled by the international teams. So I don't think that we'll sit here and say, okay, let's stop and not do any more acquisitions because we need to absorb these. I think what we'll say is, how do we go find the resources to do the integration needed so that we can continue to accelerate our strategy, right? That's what -- we use acquisitions to accelerate strategy. Some people have this narrative out there that acquisitions are there, we're buying revenue, we're trying to obfuscate certain things. I have no idea if that's about looking at our strategy, look at the acquisitions we've done this year, and it's a spot on fit for everything we're doing with strategy. So wherever we think we can accelerate strategy, we're going to use acquisitions.
As far as white space is concerned, there are still some areas out there that when you look at the residential space, continue to look at like heavy amperage loads in the home, I think there's some spaces there where whether it's -- it could be in EV charging, it could be in other types of appliances that might have -- where control of those things might be important. Although I will say we've taken a big step forward with ecobee. But on the C&I side, we still have some other areas. The Off Grid acquisition, while giving us a nice head start on energy storage for C&I is still -- it's really more aimed at the mobile applications or rental applications. So I think there are some things there that we'd like to round out. But we've made some significant progress towards this effort of building the home energy ecosystem this year and also getting going on our C&I storage."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another quarter of exceptional demand as interest in our home standby generators, clean energy systems and C&I products remained incredibly strong. Production levels",3286,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another quarter of exceptional demand as interest in our home standby generators, clean energy systems and C&I products remained incredibly strong. Production levels were also the highest we have ever experienced in the quarter, with shipments of home standby generators increasing at a substantial rate over the prior year as we continue to ramp output at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. This led to record revenue growth of 34% in spite of significant operational obstacles faced across the supply chain environment that deteriorated further during the third quarter. 
Even with the higher output levels, demand remained very strong and broad-based leading to higher backlog levels, particularly for home standby generators, providing us with good visibility into significant revenue growth for 2022. Additionally, we recently announced several strategic acquisitions that will accelerate our new Powering a Smarter World strategy and provide additional avenues for growth as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. 
Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 34% to $943 million, an all-time record and also increased sequentially relative to the second quarter, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by strength in both residential and C&I products as compared to the prior year. 
Residential product growth was led by a 50% increase in shipments of home standby generators as production levels continue to increase significantly relative to prior year levels as well as tremendous year-over-year growth in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems, which also grew double digits on a sequential basis. 
Shipments of C&I products were also up dramatically in the quarter with revenue of these products now growing materially above 2019 levels due to strength across a number of end markets and geographies. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.2% were lower as compared to the prior year as they were unfavorably impacted by higher logistics and commodity costs. 
In response to the escalating costs we are experiencing, we have undertaken a number of additional pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the longer-term impact to margins. 
Now discussing our third quarter results in more detail. The megatrends driving consumer interest in backup power continued in the third quarter. Most notably, the Home as a Sanctuary trend, combined with more extreme weather, which again resulted in elevated power outage activity. Overall, baseline outage activity for the trailing 4 quarters grew on a year-over-year basis in the quarter despite a very strong prior year comparison and remains well above the long-term baseline average. 
In fact, since we began tracking the impact of outage activity more than a decade ago, 4 of the top 10 power outage severity quarters have occurred since the second half of last year.  The convergence of the heightened power outage activity broader electrification trends and people spending more time at home has driven unprecedented demand for home standby generators. 
As a result, home consultations or sales leads, increased again at a strong double-digit rate in the third quarter over the robust prior year comparison, and broad-based growth continues to be experienced as almost all U.S. regions grew on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. It's also relevant to note that home consultations in the third quarter increased over 3x the comparable 2019 levels, and on a year-to-date basis more than 4x 2019 levels. 
Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. We continue to experience a strong expansion of our distribution footprint as we ended the third quarter with approximately 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of 1,100 dealers over the last 12 months. California and Texas alone continue to account for nearly 1/3 of the year-over-year increase. 
Early in the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. We continue to make encouraging progress increasing production levels for home standby generators across our operating footprint with daily build rates much higher compared to prior year levels. 
Despite the higher output, demand for home standby generators continues to outpace our ability to produce them, which has caused lead times to further grow to approximately 30 weeks. These significant lead times provide excellent visibility as we head into 2022, with our home standby backlog projected to be well over $1 billion entering the next year. 
As we consider the longer-term capacity requirements for home standby production, we have made a number of strategic decisions to further expand our footprint. Yesterday, we announced plans to expand warehousing and distribution capacity at our Trenton facility by adding 200,000 square feet, which will increase the current size of the building by nearly 50%. 
In addition, we recently made commitments to purchase additional long lead time automated manufacturing equipment that would be available to come online in 2023, further increasing our capacity for several key components to provide for needed search production as the category continues to grow. In addition to these capacity expansion actions, last week, we introduced the industry's largest air-cooled home standby generator, our new 26-kilowatt unit. 
Building upon the success of the launch of our 24-kilowatt unit last year, the new 26-kilowatt unit will allow homeowners to access the kind of power only previously available in larger sized, liquid cool generators at a significantly lower cost. As the trend to decarbonize accelerates, the electrification of everything in the home, including heating, cooking, cleaning and ultimately, transportation will lead to much greater residential electricity consumption. 
The new 26-kilowatt home standby unit will be capable of providing the kind of resiliency needed with these larger electrical loads and will provide an ability to future proof of home as these electrification trends intensify in the years ahead. With the strong outage environment and mega trends like Home as a Sanctuary underpinning tremendous demand for home standby generators, those same factors, along with the increasing penetration of solar installations are also driving rapid growth for our clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, shipments of our power cell energy storage systems grew significantly as compared to the prior year and also grew at a double-digit rate sequentially. 
Despite numerous supply chain challenges also impacting clean energy products, we continue to experience growth well above the broader U.S. residential solar market, driven by ongoing increases in storage attachment rates and continued market share gains. In addition to strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy products continue to show favorable trends. Home consultations expanded as compared to the prior year and accelerated throughout the quarter. 
System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, more than doubled in the third quarter as compared to the prior year and also increased sequentially. In addition, we further built out our installer network as we entered the third quarter with approximately 2,300 trained and certified dealers with nearly 1,000 of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE sales platform. 
Despite the industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges, we expect clean energy revenues to approximately double for full year 2021 on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we continue to drive profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain. 
Building on the early success we've experienced with our clean energy product offering, we formally announced several exciting new clean energy-related products during the third quarter that we believe will further grow our competitive advantage in this exciting new market. We introduced the industry's first purpose-built dedicated battery charging generator during the quarter, the power generator, which is a one-of-a-kind power product, enabling a homeowner to create a solar plus storage system that is completely grid-independent. 
We also introduced our new PWRmanager load control system that maximizes battery performance and offers homeowners the ability to control specific electric loads from a mobile device via our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform. And building off the early integration success with the recent Chilicon acquisition, we introduced the PWRmicro, a Generac-branded microinverter that allows us to fully participate in the residential solar only market, a meaningful expansion beyond the solar plus storage space we previously addressed. 
In another example of our focus on continued innovation, we announced the acquisition of Apricity, an advanced engineering and product design company focused on developing energy technology solutions. The team at Apricity brings expertise in designing and prototyping energy-related products to increase reliability, add functionality and improve performance. 
The company has also developed a unique smart water heater controller that is used as a grid edge device by utilities and demand response and other energy conservation programs. Bringing this talented group on board will accelerate our efforts in expanding our clean energy offerings and increase our speed to market for key clean energy and grid services products and solutions. 
To further build upon Generac's evolution into an energy technology solutions company, yesterday, we announced an exciting agreement to acquire ecobee, which accelerates our capability to provide a home energy ecosystem with a dual-value proposition for both homeowners and grid operators, ecobee is a pioneer in the smart thermostat market, and offers a full line of intelligent thermostats and home monitoring products that deliver significant energy savings, security and peace of mind and enable the monitoring and control of a significant portion of the home's electrical loads. Residential HVAC systems represent the single largest energy-consuming device in the home today, and ecobee has created an intelligent system using smart thermostats and sensors to effectively balance comfort and conservation. 
With over 5 million connected devices in more than 2 million homes, ecobee customers in North America have saved more than 20 terawatts of energy, which is the equivalent of saving enough energy to take all the homes in Los Angeles off the grid for an entire year. 
Importantly, ecobee adds to Generac's growing suite of residential power generation, energy storage and energy management solutions that we believe will play a pivotal role in helping to solve the challenges of the growing supply and demand imbalances of today's electrical grid. 
Smart thermostat controls represent one of the largest opportunities within the grid services' addressable market, involving the connection of grid edge devices to a grid services platform like our Concerto software platform, thereby enabling participation in grid services programs. 
Adding ecobee's devices to our product portfolio considerably expands our served market opportunity and increases our capabilities to provide end-to-end solutions for turnkey virtual power plant projects. Adding ecobee's innovative team of over 500 employees gives us the ability to further advance the development of an intelligent and intuitive user interface platform that would integrate and synchronize our generation and storage equipment and our existing Grid Edge devices providing seamless access and control for homeowners through a smartphone, tablet or PC. 
We believe this approach will create one of the broadest home energy ecosystems available on the market today and allow for easy connection to our Concerto platform empowering homeowners to make smarter energy production, storage and consumption decisions while providing grid operators more efficient access to the home in aggregate or at the device level for grid support programs. 
I'd also like to provide a brief update on Generac Grid Services, a new group within Generac that was formed in the third quarter that builds upon our October 2020 acquisition of Enbala Power Networks. Generic Grid Services was established to directly engage and serve utilities, energy retailers and grid operators to provide an array of solutions and enable entirely new value streams that leverage a range of products from our portfolio. 
We took another major step toward unlocking significant value in the grid services space in the third quarter with the formal announcement of smart grid ready capabilities across our home standby generators, our C&I natural gas generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems. 
In addition to the peace of mind that they're receiving from Generac products, customers now have the opportunity to also obtain additional return on investment by leveraging their products to support grid reliability, resiliency and sustainability. Within the expanding grid services marketplace, we believe Generac Grid Services is a unique and differentiated market leader due to our comprehensive set of hardware plus software plus services offerings, including through our smart grid ready capabilities for legacy products, our recent acquisition of Apricity smart water heater controllers and our pending acquisition of ecobee and its home energy management solutions. 
Our increasing integration of hardware with grid software and services is leading to a number of contract wins, along with a significant increase in proposal requests and an overall expanding sales pipeline. These include several examples of the new revenue streams within our grid services model as we layer on higher-value turnkey virtual power plant programs utilizing Generac hardware and performance contracts on top of the Concerto software as a Service platform.
We are in the very early innings of the evolution of the power grid. But as consumer awareness grows and demand from utilities and grid operators materializes, we remain incredibly excited about the potential long-term growth trajectory of Generac Grid Services. The excitement around our expanding energy technology solution capabilities extends into the C&I product range as well. 
We're offerings such as energy-as-a-service, microgrid solutions and mobile energy storage systems are helping drive the long-term growth trajectory and an increasing mix of energy technology revenues. 
Our core C&I business experienced strong momentum in the third quarter as a number of end markets and geographies continue to recover strongly off the COVID weakened prior year quarter. Specifically, C&I product sales grew 47% as compared to the prior year, and 31% on a core basis. We also have a considerable backlog that is growing for C&I products that provides good visibility for meaningful growth heading into 2022.
In addition to strong quoting and order activity in our North American distributor channel, shipments to telecom national account customers increased dramatically again during the quarter as compared to the prior year as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers continued at elevated levels and have led to further increase in project shipments during the current year. 
The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' 5G networks. 
The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications. We also experienced very strong growth within our national account -- national rental account customers as shipments of mobile products continue to recover at a significant rate of the COVID-driven lows of 2020. 
We still expect shipments of mobile products to improve dramatically for the full year 2021 as the prior year -- as national rental account customers invest heavily in fleet equipment with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve. We remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products given the important mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could benefit from the potential economic stimulus plans being pursued through the federal infrastructure spending bill.
Additionally, we continue to build great momentum with our C&I beyond standby initiatives. We are experiencing ongoing strength in project quoting for our natural gas generators using applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in energy-as-a-service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation applications. 
During the third quarter, we announced a 5-year agreement with Enchanted Rock to build and supply the advanced natural gas generators and control systems that are used in ultra-low emission, dual-purpose microgrids that Enchanted Rock designs and operates. These solutions provide commercial, industrial and governmental customers with affordable and reliable backup power and supply electric grid operators with critical grid stability services that accelerate the adoption of wind and solar without sacrificing overall grid reliability.
The microgrid solutions are based on Generac's rich-burn gaseous engine technology and our newly acquired Deep Sea Electronics' control systems, which provides quick start, utility-grade backup power in a much cleaner format when compared to traditional diesel generator solutions. 
We remain very optimistic regarding customer and grid operator interest in beyond standby applications, of our C&I natural gas generators. It's being driven by the need for enhanced grid stability and resiliency that these large blocks of power can offer as well as the tangible and meaningful return on the investment opportunity for asset owners. 
Our international business continues to see strong momentum as well with net sales growth of 61% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter and 32% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, and the impact of favorable foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all major regions that continue to experience a sharp increase in demand off the prior year COVID lows and have also recovered well above 2019 levels.
Larger project quoting and overall order activity continued to recover at a strong pace in key international markets, which drove growth in our international backlog during the third quarter with the order strength continuing thus far in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, the segment's third quarter EBITDA margin expanded to 14.1% from 7.9% in the year ago period due to the higher margin profile impact from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and improved operating leverage in the base business on higher sales volumes. 
With regards to Off Grid Energy, this acquisition closed on September 1 and brings a diverse range of energy storage solutions that provide cleaner and more flexible energy for industrial and mobile applications. Off Grid provides us an entry point into the rapidly growing market for industrial grade energy storage systems and accelerates our hybrid generator and C&I energy storage product road map. 
Off Grid continues to see robust demand for its products in its core European markets, and we're working to bring these solutions to the rest of our geographic footprint given our strong global relationships with rental equipment customers. Our integration efforts are off to a strong start with some legacy customers across Europe having already placed orders for Off Grid products, highlighting early momentum in the sales synergies that we expect to realize.
In closing today, we have tremendous momentum in our business as we close out the current year and head into 2022 with incredible home standby demand and expanding energy technology solutions portfolio, a growing grid services sales pipeline and strong global demand for our C&I products. This provides support for yet another year of significant revenue growth with recent pricing and cost initiatives driving an improving margin profile. 
Day-to-day execution and navigation of the supply chain challenges clearly remains a near-term priority for our teams. But we're also keeping a clear focus on our new long-term Powering a Smarter World strategy with our ultimate purpose to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Through the combination of aggressive organic investment and a series of strategic acquisitions over the past 3 years, Generac is uniquely positioned with our products, our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise to deliver the solutions necessary to facilitate the transition to the next-generation electrical grid. 
Importantly, we retain significant financial flexibility to further invest and expand our capabilities and continue to advance our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on third quarter results and our updated outlook. York?"

The combination of contribu",2123,"Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 34% to $942.7 million during the third quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $701.4 million in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from the Mean Green, Enbala, Deep Sea, Chilicon and Off Grid acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.
Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales grew to $608.8 million as compared to $458.9 million in the prior year, representing a 33% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. 
As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth advancing by 50% during the third quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products despite challenging supply chain headwinds. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as storage attachment rates and market share gains continue to drive growth of Generac's clean energy solutions. This growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments of portable generators, which faced a strong prior year comparison from a record level of shipments to the Hurricane Isaias the prior year.
Commercial and industrial product net sales for the third quarter of 2021 increased 47% to $258.3 million as compared to $176.2 million in the prior year quarter. There was an approximate 15% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions along with the favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was in part aided by the soft prior year comparison due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, C&I revenue also grew approximately 7% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels. The strength in core sales was driven by growth across a number of end markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a strong rate, both domestically and internationally in the following areas.
Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers due to much higher capital spending levels from these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks and prepare for 5G rollouts. 
Also contributing to the increase was strong growth from mobile products to our rental channel customers as they are investing heavily in their fleets due to higher utilization and rental rates. We also experienced higher shipments of natural gas generators used in beyond standby applications. Internationally, the increase in C&I products was broad-based from a geographic standpoint, most notably in Europe and Latin America as these markets continue to experience a sharp increase in demand of the prior year COVID lows and have recovered well above 2019 levels.
Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 14% to $75.6 million as compared to $66.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 4% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. 
Heightened power outage activity over the past several quarters continues to drive strong growth in aftermarket service parts. A larger and growing installed base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 35.6% compared to 39.4% in the prior year third quarter as higher input costs had a significant unfavorable impact during the quarter. 
Specifically, rising commodity prices, labor rates and logistics costs, along with the Trenton plant start-up, all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The early impact of pricing actions partially offset these margin pressures, with the full impact expected to be realized throughout 2022 as these price increases work through our backlog.
Operating expenses increased $41.9 million or 34.8% as compared to the third quarter of 2020 but declined 13 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the substantially higher sales volumes on the current year quarter. 
The increase in OpEx dollars was primarily driven by additional variable expenses from a significant increase in sales volume, higher employee costs and marketing spend and the impact of acquisitions. Specifically, recurring OpEx from the Mean Green, Enbala, Deep Sea, Chilicon, Apricity and Off Grid acquisitions, related higher amortization expense and incremental transaction cost during the current year quarter.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $209.2 million or 22.2% of net sales as compared to $178.8 million or 25.5% of net sales in the prior year. This EBITDA margin decrease was largely driven by the aforementioned decline in gross margin.
I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reportable segments. Domestic segment sales increased 30% to $791 million as compared to $607 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 1% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $187.7 million, representing a 23.7% margin as compared to $171.4 million in the prior year or 28.2% of net sales. 
International segment sales increased 61% to $152 million as compared to $94 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 32% compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $21.5 million or 14.1% of net sales as compared to $7.4 million or 7.9% of net sales in the prior year. The strong growth in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to the favorable impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, and incremental operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. 
Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $131.6 million as compared to $115 million for the third quarter of 2020.
GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $32.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% as compared to $32.1 million or an effective tax rate of 21.8% for the prior year. The decline in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item resulting from a higher stock compensation deduction during the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.93 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.82 for the prior year. 
Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $151.1 million in the current year quarter or $2.35 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $132.9 million in the prior year or $2.08 per share.
Cash income taxes for the third quarter of 2021 were $31.3 million as compared to $23.6 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20% to 20.5% for the full year 2021 compared to our previous expectation of approximately 21% to 21.5%. 
The decrease is primarily driven by a higher-than-expected level of stock compensation deduction. This expected full year cash tax rate compared to the prior year rate of 16% that was anticipated after the third quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate.
Cash flow from operations was $74 million as compared to $155 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $42 million as compared to $148 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a higher working capital investment in the current year quarter and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings versus prior year. 
The higher working capital investment was driven by elevated inventory at the end of the current year quarter resulting from extended logistics in transit timing, continued supply chain constraints, ramping production rates and the start-up of our new Trenton, South Carolina facility.
Updating our liquidity position as of September 30, 2021, we had $873 million of liquidity comprised of $424 million of cash on hand and $449 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter was $910 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was only 1.1x on an as-reported basis.
Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months at $455 million. I would now like to provide some additional details on our outlook for full year 2021. 
As mentioned in our press release earlier this morning, we are maintaining our full year 2021 net sales growth guidance range of approximately 47% to 50% compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 5% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. The expected benefit from acquisitions is moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the Off Grid Energy, Tank Utility and ecobee acquisitions not included in our previous guidance.
Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021. As we've discussed, we are continuing to experience significant supply chain challenges, logistics delays and rising commodity prices, which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance. As a result of these factors, we now expect gross margin for the full year '21 to decline approximately 150 basis points as compared to the prior year, which compares to the previous expectation of approximately flat versus the prior year. 
Due to the reduced gross margin outlook, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 23.5%, which compares to the previous guidance of 24.5% to 25%. As a result, we expect to maintain EBITDA margins compared to the prior year despite the significant margin headwinds and acquisitions executed during the current year.
Providing some quick comments regarding our initial thoughts looking into 2022, the company's consolidated backlog has increased considerably since reporting our second quarter results, most notably for home standby generators, but also across a broad range of other residential and C&I product categories. 
For example, and as Aaron mentioned, our home standby backlog alone is projected to be well over $1 billion entering the new year. The substantial overall backlog expected at the end of this year provides support for another year of projected significant revenue growth in 2022 with an improving margin profile as we begin to realize the full impact of various pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives.
Throughout 2021, we have implemented multiple rounds of price increases across all product categories with different realization lags depending on lead times. We expect increasing realization of all 2021 pricing actions throughout the first half of 2022, with the full benefit realized by the second half of 2022. We also are pursuing certain cost reduction initiatives to combat the significant increased input costs, including important projects focused on profitability enhancement and continuous improvement activities.
We will now provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be between 20% to 20.5%, which compares to prior guidance of 21% to 21.5%. GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecasted to be approximately $45 million to $47 million as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $49 million, with the decrease primarily due to updated purchase accounting adjustments related to recent acquisitions. 
Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $26 million to $27 million as compared to previous guidance of $24 million, primarily due to the impact of additional acquisitions since our second quarter update. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22% to 22.5% for the full year compared to the previous guidance range of 22.5% to 23.5%. The decline is primarily due to a higher level of stock compensation deduction during the current year.
Our fourth quarter weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 64.5 million shares, assuming a December 1 closing of the ecobee transaction. This concludes our prepared remarks at this time. We'd like to open up the call for questions."

Thanks for the question on that, Tommy, ecobee is going to be -- I think we'll look back a couple of years from now, and that's going to be a really critical turning point for us as we continue on this journey, the evolution we talk about any way of becoming an energy technology company. Specific to your question on distribution, what we really like about them is that they refer to their go-to-market or their distribution strategy as omnichannel, which is exactly how we would refer to our own.
They sell through retailers, big-box retailers, they sell online on those platforms. They sell through dealers. They have over 40,000 HVAC contractors that represent them in the marketplace. So really a pretty wide net in terms of just the way they go to market. They sell to distributors, HVAC distributors. So it's really truly omnichannel. 
So we like that, it fits well. We think there's going to be a lot of interesting synergies there. Our electrical channel can certainly install a thermostat and conversely, their trades can install some of our other products as well. So we think there's a really good fit there. 
The thermostat market, if you just look at thermostats, the definition, you're right, it's a pretty big market. This is truly, I would say, beyond that, though. This is about the intelligent thermostat platform and the smart thermostat platform. And there really are only a handful of true competitors to what ecobee does. ecobee created this category. Basically, Stuart Lombard, great -- the person who runs that business up there, a great entrepreneur began that business in 2007.
And by 2009, they had introduced the market's first true smart thermostat. And others have joined, you're right. But I think what -- when we think about our differentiation going forward, the combination of the smart thermostat as just one of the elements of -- as what we keep referring to as a home energy ecosystem, right? This is more than just a thermostat. It's more than just a water heater controller. It's more than just a single storage device or solar on the rooftop or a generator right, or a load management device. This is about the integration of all of those things. And what we really like about ecobee is it gives us a platform and it gives us a team of over 500 people up in Toronto that are steeped in user interfaces and user experience that is what we need to bring all of these assets together to combine them in a single pane of glass for view and control by the consumer. 
And then for easy attachment to grid programs through our Concerto platform. So we think that this is kind of the middle layer that is -- it's much more than just a thermostat. It's the middle layer that we need going forward to bring all of this stuff to bear as the grid continues to change and as the home energy ecosystem continues to develop.
So we're -- I'm just really excited about this. It is a cool product. If you've ever look at the product itself and just the quality of it, the premium look, fit and finish of the product itself and the platform, if you ever use the ecobee platform, it's definitely, I think, going to be a really cool platform to put all of our devices into."

As a follow-up, I wanted to talk to your HSB business, where recently at the Investor Day, you gave some directional insight on really favorable cost per lead trends.

But I think we've got our arms around some really good longer-term plans here to continue to expand capacity. 
All the things that we have been working on that will come online next year. And then we've made some pretty big commitments here in the third quarter, very recently, around not only the expansion of the Trenton facility, which I think is an important commitment, but commitments towards additional automated manufacturing equipment to help us scale even further there. But your question is a good one.
I would tell you that our marketing team watches the statistics very closely. 
And if they were to see the cost per lead starting to change, right, around where we're spending and where we're deploying dollars, they would throttle back the spending. And so far, that really hasn't been the case. So I think what people sometimes don't realize is  this -- a home standby generator project was already kind of a long term -- it was a longer, I would say, project time line for most people because there's permitting involved, there's contractors involved. 
You have the work itself, you have inspectors. Clearly, it wasn't 7 months before. But it generally was 2, 3 months. And I think people realize in today's environment that we are supply constrained on a lot of things, not just home standby generators, appliances, vehicles, you name it, and it's tough to find things today. 
So I think there's, call it, an acceptance level, I don't know what it is, but I think people are somewhat accepting of the fact that they have to wait. And I think it also speaks to just how in tune people are with the importance of having backup power. The outages have been increasing, they've been lasting longer. I think people are spending a ton more time in their homes, and they realize just how vulnerable they are. 
And what that means to the ability to work from home, their kids ability to learn from home, all the things that we need to do from home only happen with a continuous source of power. So I think a generator is just going to be -- it's going to be an appliance that we all have here going forward. We're going to need that as the grid continues to change. And that's why we're committed to expanding our capacity. We've got a lot of confidence in where this is going longer term. And I think that as it relates to marketing dollars, we're going to continue to spend there, too, as long as it makes sense financially."

Maybe just on the backlog, I think directionally, you're thinking about it right. I mean we've got -- clearly, we're going to have a bigger backlog coming into '22 than we originally thought because demand has just been stronger, I mean it's outstripping supply. We're hitting record output levels on HSB. 
We could go higher if not for some of the -- and a lot of our constraints here are pure logistics related. I mean just the nuttiness of getting components from point A to point B right now, just the amount of dwell time that's going on with components in the ports and trying to find trucks, everything else you've heard about from every single company in America, we're no different.
And that is -- that's kind of holding us back a bit. But we think that's temporary, that will resolve. We're confident that we'll get our feet under us as a country here around getting our supply chains repaired. But directionally, you're right. I think that the real question is, we talked about this double-double in terms of our capacity. That's theoretical capacity. If the supply chain constraints persist into the first half of next year, that could obviously create some headwinds, right, to what we originally thought of in terms of ultimate theoretical capacity. 
So that's something we've got to watch. Longer term, again, we feel like we've got a good plan to go even higher, to go even further with home standby capacity. We've got the confidence to do that. I think you may have hit on something that that's really important here is in the distribution network in terms of installation. We have 8,100 dealers today. We're growing that number, we've grown 1,100 dealers over the last 12 months, the most in any last 12-month period we've ever grown, and we're going to need to grow a lot more.
The reality of it is we're going to have to pick up the pace of installations so that we can keep pace as we deliver more products going into next year. Now remember that dealers aren't the only people who do installations. Installations are also done generally by contractors. There's over 70,000 electrical contractors out there, and there's over 100,000 HVAC contractors. And both of those trades do HSB installations. So it's beyond just our dealers. They do the lion's share, but  it's also other trades that are involved who may not be dealers for us. 
So we have a pretty wide availability of contractors, but we really need to do a lot more training. We need to find more dealers. And we've got a, I would say, an outsized effort and outsized focus on that for next year. I don't know, York, if there's any additional comments you want to make I think you hit on."

The September increase, we'll actually see because that was on shipments, we'll see that here in Q4. That was a smaller one. 
The one coming up here, that probably won't realize till, let's say, July, given our lead times. So I think -- and then you look at other products, we're also -- we've rolled out pricing as well. So I think I would say by the end of the first half of 2022, we'll get full realization of all of our pricing.

I would say, Ross, it's interesting, kind of as we unpack this, what -- the way that the costs rose so rapidly, in particular, around logistics. I mean that was a big deal. And steel, certain commodity costs that are heavy in our products. 
Two things happened. One, we've got -- we had this -- we've just got long lead times on the product. So getting pricing to realize, we're somewhat constrained there just because of the outsized demand for HSB in particular. But then also, I would say, our cost lags, if you will, have shortened because we're burning through material so much quicker. The pace of production is increasing at such a volatile pace where I think lags of increases in the past with commodities and other things might have taken us a while longer to get through and start to show and read through in the EBITDA margins or even the gross margins, they're reading through quicker right now. So temporary, we got a good plan to get ahead of it and feel really good about where we're going to be next year."

So I was wondering if you could expand on whether or not you've made the decision on capacity expansion beyond the Q2 '22 double. 
So have you guys locked in supply chain agreements, which I believe are critical? And have you made any, yes, commitments there? And then finally, the Jefferson facility, I think you guys have converted that to being permanent. Is that key for reaching that Q2 '22 double as well?"

Yes, capacity at HSB, let's just kind of run through a couple of things in your question. So the expansion of Trenton, first. So that expansion add 200,000 square feet to that facility, that is really about warehousing and distribution. So I wouldn't say it would impact our double-double at all. 
What it is representative of is our confidence that we're going to be able to run at an elevated rate down there for an extended period of time. We would have had to do the warehousing and distribution end of that with [ 3PLs ]. By bringing in-house, we just we get a nice payback on that project pretty quickly. So that just made a lot of sense and I think is indicative of kind of the longer-term feelings that we have about not only Trenton, we like the facility, we like the labor pool but also just the category, home standby in general.
Now on the additional capacity that we talked about on our prepared remarks, with the long lead time automated manufacturing equipment, really, what's going on there is, as we've talked, Phil, we have some internal components we manufacture that -- of which the tooling to make that equipment has just gotten crazy long. 
I mean we're talking 60 to 70 weeks long in terms of ordering the equipment and getting it delivered and starting to run it off. So what we're doing there is we're basically saying, look, we have confidence in the category. We have confidence in the demand we're seeing. Let's get our tooling on order. 
We don't even know where we're going to put the tooling, right? We're not exactly sure if it's going to go in maybe another expansion of Trenton or maybe the -- maybe we squeeze it into Whitewater or maybe we put it into Jefferson and I'll address that here in a second or maybe it's a whole other facility. We don't really know yet.
What we do know is it will allow us to go further than the double-double that we talked about, right? So it gets us set up to do that. So now we start the rest of the ground game that has to get done there around supply chain, around all the other elements that have to fall into place. 
And we'll be able to provide more color on that as we get closer to it, but we just -- we felt like we had to take the first step here, given the lead times on that equipment, we just wanted to get -- make sure that we got ahead of it, and we didn't want to get in a situation where we couldn't react. So we're kind of putting our markers down for the future there.
And then on Jefferson, you're right, we kind of took a facility where we're making portable generators, power washers, core products. And we've added capacity for HSP. We added another production line there here recently in the third quarter. So we're producing more out of Jefferson and we anticipate producing more as we end the year here. 
If you recall, we mentioned that we're going to the outside for some key components that we normally manufacture. So we spooled up some components on the outside. Those are going to start to be delivered here in the back half of the fourth quarter, and they're going to go to Jefferson where they're going to help us increase capacity there. 
Whether or not we continue to do that long term, I think we're going to continue to do it for the foreseeable future, for certain the next 12 months. I think all of '22 will be producing HSB in Jefferson and likely into 2023, depending on kind of what kind of backlog, if we're able to knock the backlog out next year, which is looking less and less likely, just given where the demand is. 
I mean it just keeps coming every day. It's amazing. And so where that demand ends up, where we may end up for the year of 2022 will kind of dictate how we feel about '23. And then some of that will be about where we put that new tooling as well. So more to come on that, but definitely taking the next steps that we think we need to be able to go far beyond that existing double-double that we've talked about for capacity on HSB."

They're working through those like we all are. 
And we're adding additional chip capacity across that product line. Stuart and his team are doing a nice job of navigating that. Their growth rate is going to be about 3x the Generac growth rate as we laid it out in the LRP model for the Investor Day. So they've got a lot of aggressive growth on the table. That's not only devices, but it's also services. So pretty exciting. That's a lot of growth coming out of the services piece going forward.
But no, it's actually -- I kind of call it a start-up that's kind of getting to scale. They've been around 14 years, and they spent a lot of time getting to this point and they've really started to see an inflection here in the last couple of years. They are still in investment mode, so they're generating operating losses today, and will continue to do so. We're going to continue that investment cycle over the next couple of years. It's probably going to be a couple of years before they're breakeven. 
So -- but that doesn't worry us. We think it's an important investment to continue to make, not only around their existing platforms around the home energy monitoring, but also, again, around integration and synchronization of all of our assets that are part of our home energy ecosystem going forward."

But the existing systems that we're bringing on here in Q1 and Q2 of next year are still holding in there in terms of the time line. So we feel good about that. No material delays there. The rest of the supply chain challenges whether it be building out the Trenton facility or some of the other things that we're trying to do here, I think we've effectively kind of -- we've built that into our assumptions around the timing of when those things will become meaningful to us or when they'll come online.
It's really the near-term true component supply chain that's been just that really deteriorated in the third quarter. When we sat there even when we talked to everybody at our Investor Day, I mean, just what it did from the end of kind of the middle to the end of September to the end of October was disappointing, right? Just the amount of ships that anchor on the West Coast, just the trucking challenges, the rail challenges, the port challenges, the amount of additional time it's taking to get things here. 
Forget about the cost to get it here, which is mind numbing as well, but the time. It's really the time factor to get it here. I'm really hopeful that, that's going to start to turn around here over the next  60 days I'm hoping are going to be better.

You combine that with our generation capabilities, whether it be PV generation or whether it's using a natural gas generator, with storage, with our load management, with thermostatic control, water heater control, right, water heater is another massive load in the home.

Because when you think about it in the context of the total amount of money they're going to spend on that system, frankly, the grid edge devices being thermostats and water heater controllers and load management controls, they're relatively small, but they add a tremendous amount of value in rounding out the value proposition not only for the homeowner but also, again, for the grid operator. 
I think that's where it gets really interesting is what we can do with that through our Concerto platform. So anyway, we're taking a really long view at this, but it's an exciting view of the world kind of in the future grid 2.0 context that I think you've got to step back and you've got to kind of see where the puck is going here, and that's kind of what we're doing with this acquisition."

I would say, informally, though, what our comment -- just answering your question directly about how I feel about it today versus maybe how I felt about it 4 or 6 weeks ago, when we put together the IR materials, the IR Day materials, I would say I'm less optimistic that we're going to be able to catch the full backlog next year as we exit the year. 
The demand has outstripped here over the last in the more recent period here as we ended Q3 and as we have come into Q4, it's just -- it's odd to me -- I mean -- and we really have had -- October for the most part, was a pretty quiet month on outages, but the demand has been continuing just to be off the charts.
I mean there's really no two ways to say it. I mean everything from our leading indicators like ICs to our lagging indicators like activations and then obviously, the incoming orders that are outstripping our kind of record production levels here. It just -- the setup there is -- and it's clear to us. As we continue to kind of peel back the onion on why that is, that the Home as a Sanctuary trend, the electrification of everything, the concern about just power security, power reliability, these things are real. 
These things are driving people to solutions like home standby generators and clean energy storage devices. And we're coming to a point of realization, I think that -- and it's why we made the comments about our commitments to the longer-term home standby capacity increases because we just feel like this is -- we're maybe at a tipping point here with this category, where we're just shy of what 6% penetration, I think, today and the acceleration on that is phenomenal. We could be entering a period here where this is something that we think about as -- that every home has to have. And there's a lot in between 6% and saying something that every home has to have. Remember, every 1% is $2.5 billion. So every 1% of penetration is $2.5 billion of market, and we're over 75% share in the space. 
So it's good math, right? I mean it's just -- it's a great setup, but we've got to be prepared for it. everything from the ability to produce these products to the ability to install and service the product. So there's going to be a tremendous amount of focus there has been tremendous amount of focus so far but there needs to be a lot more focus by us going forward on all those areas. So that we're ready for this so that we can enable this because the secular things that we're seeing out here causing it, we don't see changing anytime soon. So we've just got to be ready for it."

You were a bit more vocal than I've heard you in terms of some of the value proposition or unlocking the value proposition, I guess, with the installed base. And so I was wondering if you might be able to unpack that a little bit more. And so if I look out at installed capacity that's underutilized out in the field of generators, it looks like well over 20 gigawatts of generating capacity. 
So now that you're going to be adding in this intelligence with ecobee, how do you get me if I have a 24-kilowatt generator to sign up for being able to access my generator when I don't need that through the Concerto, for example? And where are you in that process with utilities? Does that have to go through a rate case? Or how do you -- how does that kind of evolve to unlocking that 20-plus gigawatts?"

We were a little bit more vocal on that at this time because we continue to gain confidence based on, honestly, just the sheer number of proposals in our pipeline. It's changed dramatically in the 1 year that we've owned Enbala. The Concerto platform, they just did their latest release of the platform that adds additional functionality that adds, again, the smart grid ready capability to our products. We've added here initially the home standby generators, C&I gas generators, our PWRcell systems, even our PWRmanager, the load management device, we're making all of those smart grid ready.
And as we see more proposals coming in, it gets us more and more excited about the opportunity to connect those assets through Concerto to these grid operators to be able to participate in these programs. I will tell you that there is still this -- I don't want to say it's a missing link, but there's the connection process of the marketing process, right, of going out to a utilities rate payers and saying, okay, we can walk in today. We've got this. 
We demonstrated here at the Investor Day. You guys may have remembered back in our labs here, we showed our  map, if you will, of the U.S. and where we can zoom in on all of the assets we have on the ground, these distributed energy resources, be they generators or be they storage systems or load management devices. And now going forward be they ecobee products like thermostats and sensors, we're going to put all of that into the map. 
But we can go to a local utility, and we can have a conversation with them that's much more than just, hey, tell us about your needs. We can go in there and we can say, hey, did you know that you have this many hundreds of megawatts available to you in your market that could be connected. It's on the ground today. These assets are there.
And so -- and that's just -- it's stunning. The amount of information that provides to these utilities, they have no idea. They have no idea that this exists today. It's not something you have to do in the future. it's something they have today. 
The next question is, okay, how do we connect it? How do we reach those consumers that own those assets and enroll them into the platform and then get them on these programs? So each utility is a little different, as you know. Some utilities move a little faster than others. 
Today, we're in pilot on a number of programs with some utilities around taking existing generator owners or existing PWRcell owners or new PWRcell owners and marketing to them the opportunity to enroll that asset. If they've already got it installed, great. If they don't, they can buy one, get it installed and get it enrolled. 
We're going through pilot on a number of these programs, and we're already exercising control. We're giving the utilities control over these pilot programs. And they're very excited about what they think they can do and what they think it means to the way they operate their grids in the future.
Look, they have their backs against the wall, right? They are being mandated to -- and we all want to do this. We want to decarbonize our energy use. And that decarbonization is going to come from putting more renewables on the supply side. But with that comes more instability, right? So you talk about the change in the grid. There's the 3Ds, right, decarbonization, digitization and decentralization. That's what the new grid is going to look like. 
The pace that we're going to get there, though, creates a fourth D, create some destabilization potentially, right? So some instability around these renewables that are online that maybe are not as predictable for baseload usage. So what we have to do is we've got to give new tools to grid operators to solve for this challenge. A grid operator's entire day is consumed by figuring out how to keep supply and demand in balance. 
And that's exactly what the Concerto platform does. That's why we continue to add more grid assets like ecobee into our mix because we think that the more assets we can deliver to these grid operators and utilities the more value as a partner we're going to bring. And certainly, more value we're going to bring to the homeowner in terms of them being able to control and optimize their energy consumption. So really exciting future around that, but it's really all about grid services down the line. And that's why we talk more about it today."

It's an area of the world that, as you said, it's kind of an obvious one in terms of just the challenges and the challenging set up here going into the winter months for the Europeans in the way that they're -- in some cases, their dangerous energy situation there. And our products can help, I mean, the interest level in particular, on home standby which picked up. 
We saw that very broadly as well with Home as a Sanctuary last year. We saw interest outside the U.S. pick up far beyond anything we had seen previously for the category. And so -- but you're right, we're supply constrained. That's the unfortunate side of things. But we're still getting product over there. We're up dramatically in what we're delivering to Europe. It's still very small as a base, but it's growing very quickly. 
Storage is another area. We think that we have an opportunity there. It's probably a little bit further out as we deliver on some modifications to our existing PWRcell system. We'll have a new system coming out in 2023, and that system is probably going to be a little bit better fit for some of the European applications. But we are looking at how we might go after that market more aggressively here because it's going to take it's going to take some time to get our distribution and our go-to-market approach under us there. 
So working on that. I will point out the Off Grid acquisition that we did is all about what's going on in Europe, right, with storage in general on the C&I side, we're seeing a lot of opportunities there -- certainly in the rental markets to provide storage for the different applications there, whether it be entertainment applications or construction applications or things like that, where clearly, the high cost of diesel fuel and even the availability in some cases, the fuel in general, is causing challenges.
So we're seeing storage systems like the Off Grid systems become a lot more popular. That asset is in the short period of time we've owned it, just the order book there has been really fun to kind of watch that grow as those products get introduced. We introduced them to our legacy channel partners there. But yes, Europe represents a huge market opportunity. We're going to stay focused on it, but I'd love to say that we're going to be able to do something more there next year, but we got a tiger by the tail here in North America as well."

We still think that's probably maybe a first half '22 story and then should abate. 
But I would say we're more constrained right now just based on the inability to just go beyond what -- as we get the up the learning curve here in Trenton and as we put a second line on in Jefferson and then as we go into next year with the new tooling that's going to get delivered there, that's just kind of the pacing of getting to those levels that we've talked about. 
And certainly, some supply chain constraints today causing that. But I would say it's more just demand outstripping.

It's generally dictated by sellers or dictated by market processes, things like that. 
So it just happened that this year, we got 6 that came to us. We have a really strong team here. And thankfully, the acquisitions have actually been spread out nicely across our C&I business, across our residential business, across our clean energy businesses.

That's what -- we use acquisitions to accelerate strategy. 
Some people have this narrative out there that acquisitions are there, we're buying revenue, we're trying to obfuscate certain things. I have no idea if that's about looking at our strategy, look at the acquisitions we've done this year, and it's a spot on fit for everything we're doing with strategy. So wherever we think we can accelerate strategy, we're going to use acquisitions.
As far as white space is concerned, there are still some areas out there that when you look at the residential space, continue to look at like heavy amperage loads in the home, I think there's some spaces there where whether it's -- it could be in EV charging, it could be in other types of appliances that might have -- where control of those things might be important. 
Although I will say we've taken a big step forward with ecobee. But on the C&I side, we still have some other areas. The Off Grid acquisition, while giving us a nice head start on energy storage for C&I is still -- it was really more aimed at the mobile applications or rental applications. So I think there are some things there that we'd like to round out.

No. I mean, I think I highlighted 4 things that are causing elevated inventory, just it's taking longer for things to get here. So the transit times are extended. The supply chain constraints are caused when certain components don't arrive to the line and everything else does, you get a little bit of backup in inventory. We are ramping production. 
So to the extent we're wrapping production, that should continue. And we're basically -- and once we get Trenton up and running, too, that's going to be increasing as well as we go into Q1 next year. So I'd probably say relative to the ramping part of the discussion, that will continue into Q1. But I think with regards to the  longer in-transit times and just the supply chain constraints, I think that probably has worked its way through and hopefully should level off here into next year."
