We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We are off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted",803,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We are off to a solid start to the fiscal year. 
Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate count and outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution segment and lower O&M spending, largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments. 
Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide 4 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental $50 million in operating income. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $6 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas, most notably in our North Texas distribution business. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint. 
The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduced consolidated operating income by approximately $9 million this quarter, primarily in our Distribution segment. Quarter-over-quarter, operating income fell approximately $2.5 million due to lower commercial demand attributable to the effect of the pandemic on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and bad debt expense increased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. 
Consolidated on expense, excluding bad debt, decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred noncompliant spending into later in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs. O&M at our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to nonrecurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M management during the first quarter of this year. 
Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the timing of product spending in our Distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of the spending focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission network while reducing methane emissions. 
We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $32 million in progress.  Slides 18 to 24 summarize these outcomes, and Slide 17 outlines our planned filings through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost-effective manner with maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. 
Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieved a weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares from $122 million, and we settled forward agreements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net proceeds during the quarter. 
As of December 31, we have approximately $247 million in net proceeds available under existing foreign sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM program. 
As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. 
The strength of our balance sheet in our 5-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. During the first quarter, Moody's and S&P maintained their ratings with a stable outlook. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile may follow on Slides 6 through 9. 
So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regulatory activities were in line with our expectations. As we continue through the winter heating season, we continue to remain cautious, given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. However, with yesterday's reaffirmation, we remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin?"

As you can see from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems. 
We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technology that will enable Atmos Energy to scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years. 
Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training and invest in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years, we have invested more than $11 billion company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure, over 80% of which was allocated to safety. And over the next 5 years, we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000 to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast iron by the end of 2021. 
To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a pipeline safety management system, following the American Petroleum Institute's 2015 publication of the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by reviewing practices, policies and procedures as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in the industry. 
This quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12 related to the incident that occurred at a Dallas, Texas residents in February 2018. The field investigation and lab reports confirmed that unreported third-party excavation damage on mechanical equipment caused domain to crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon. 
The cost third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention. Those such efforts as auditing our third-party line locating services to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to provide damage prevention materials and ensure proper at one notification. 
We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing hazardous condition is discovered, if first responders are not already on site. 
As I've discussed before, we've enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format, coupled with hands-on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience, all without sacrificing quality. These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. 
You may recall on our fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced 5 focus areas in our environmental strategy, all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe replacement efforts. These 5 focus areas are gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also discussed the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers. 
Today, I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we moved nearly 5.5 Bcf of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states for additional supply. 
During first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their facility to our system. Although it's too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport across our system, please note we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop the frameworks for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment. 
Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting as we published our third corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as our methane emissions report. Both of these can be found in the corporate responsibility section of our website. These reports, paired with our corporate responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work. 
As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy. And the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and getting back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner. 
Long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They are supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions where several of our markets continue to have strong long-term growth potential, most notably, the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies in an environmentally responsible manner. 
The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry energy needs now and in the future. 
I appreciate your time this morning, and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll take any questions that you may have, and I'll turn it back over to the operator."

I'll start here, and Kevin, feel free to jump in as well. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we had about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact, but we've attributed to COVID between commercial load loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense. 
On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that perspective, we're pleased to see that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We'll continue to monitor that as we move through the second quarter. We got still another 2 or 3 months left in our winter heating season, which, by the end of the winter, heating season will have about 70% of our distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year, and we'll have some more clarity around what the impact on the margin line item will be. 
Same thing with the service order revenues. A lot of it will be contingent upon when we resume full collection activities. And we're working with our regulators on that, keeping you abreast of what we're doing there and -- but again, that is completely in line with our expectation."

So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we've assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will, our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that we didn't need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the customer load loss was materializing. I think we've got a better handle on that now. 
And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we're still reaffirming the O&M range that we initially put out last fall. So again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities as well as other activities designed to mitigate risk. 
As you heard Kevin talk about, third-party damage will continue to step up our efforts in that particular area as well as just other system and maintenance activities that were not necessarily compliance oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain it. 
You've heard us talk before we certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet compliance purposes just to meet and just in time, but we're also keeping an eye towards what our requirements are further down the line, later in the fiscal year or into next year so that, we are well ahead of those compliance requirements that we can meet those deadlines without having to wait to the last minute."

I think the stories are reading, you see more and more folks that are interested in maybe moving into the suburbs looking for either a first home or be a different type of home as they're accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that's what's driving a lot of the growth. 
Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust underlying economic activity in terms of companies evaluating the Dallas-Fort worth market in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue to be come -- in Dallas, there are cranes and construction everywhere. So I mean we're still seeing that underlying activity. And again, a lot of that's being driven by the residential class and that's consistent too, across the footprint.

We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We are off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate count and outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution segment and lower O&M spending, largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments.
Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide 4 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental $50 million in operating income. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $6 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas, most notably in our North Texas distribution business.
For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint.  
The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduced consolidated operating income by approximately $9 million this quarter, primarily in our Distribution segment. Quarter-over-quarter, operating income fell approximately $2.5 million due to lower commercial demand attributable to the effect of the pandemic on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and bad debt expense increased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter.
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred noncompliant spending into later in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than prior year, primarily due to nonrecurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M management during the first quarter of this year.
Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million with 87% of our spending directed towards safety, reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the timing of product spending in our Distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year, with more than 80% of the spending focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission network while reducing methane emissions.
We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $32 million in progress. Slides 18 through 24 summarize these outcomes, and Slide 17 outlines our planned filings through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost-effective manner with maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. 
Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieved a weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares for $122 million, and we settled forward agreements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net proceeds during the quarter.
As of December 31, we have approximately $247 million in net proceeds available under existing foreign sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM program.
As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements.
The strength of our balance sheet in our 5-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. During the first quarter, Moody's and S&P maintained their ratings with a stable outlook. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slides 6 through 9. 
So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regulatory activities were in line with our expectations. As we continue through the winter heating season, we continue to remain cautious, given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. However, with yesterday's reaffirmation, we remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10.

As you can see from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems. 
We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technology that will enable Atmos Energy to scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years. 
Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training and invest in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years, we have invested more than $11 billion company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure, over 80% of which was allocated to safety. And over the next 5 years, we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000 to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast iron by the end of 2021. 
To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a pipeline safety management system, following the American Petroleum Institute's 2015 publication of the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by reviewing practices, policies and procedures as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in the industry. 
This quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12 related to the incident that occurred at a Dallas, Texas residence in February 2018. The field investigation and lab reports confirmed that unreported third-party excavation damage from mechanical equipment caused the main to crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon.
Because third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention. Through such efforts as auditing our third-party line locating services to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to provide damage prevention materials and ensure proper 81 notification. 
We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing hazardous condition is discovered, if first responders are not already on site. 
As I've discussed before, we've enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format, coupled with hands-on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience, all without sacrificing quality. These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services.
You may recall on our FY 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced 5 focus areas in our environmental strategy, all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe replacement efforts. These 5 focus areas are gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also discussed the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers.
Today, I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we moved nearly 5.5 Bcf of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states for additional supply. 
During the first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their facility to our system. Although it's too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport across our system, please note we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop the frameworks for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment.
Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting as we published our third corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as our methane emissions report. Both of these can be found in the corporate responsibility section of our website. These reports, paired with our corporate responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work. 
As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy. And the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and getting back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner.
The long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They are supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions where several of our markets continue to have strong long-term growth potential, most notably, the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies in an environmentally responsible manner.
The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry needs -- energy needs now and in the future. 
I appreciate your time this morning, and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll take any questions that you may have, and I'll turn it back over to the operator."

I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we had about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact, but we've attributed to COVID between commercial load loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense. 
On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that perspective, we're pleased to see that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We'll continue to monitor that as we move through the second quarter. We got still another 2 or 3 months left in our winter heating season, which, by the end of winter heating season we'll have about 70% of our distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year, and we'll have some more clarity around what the impact on the margin line item will be.

So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we've assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will, our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that we didn't need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the customer load loss was materializing. I think we've got a better handle on that now. 
And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we're still reaffirming the O&M range that we initially put out last fall. So again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities as well as other activities designed to mitigate risk. 
As you heard Kevin talk about, third-party damage will continue to step up our efforts in that particular area as well as just other system and maintenance activities that were not necessarily compliance-oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain it. 
You've heard us talk before. We certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet compliance purposes just to meet and just in time, but we're also keeping an eye towards what our requirements are further down the line, later in the fiscal year or into next year so that we are well ahead of those compliance requirements that we can meet those deadlines without having to wait to the last minute."

I think the stories are reading, you see more and more folks that are interested in maybe moving into the suburbs looking for either a first home or be a different type of home as they're accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that's what's driving a lot of the growth. 
Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust underlying economic activity in terms of companies evaluating the Dallas-Fort Worth market in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue to see them. Come to Dallas, there are cranes and construction everywhere. So I mean we're still seeing that underlying activity. And again, a lot of that's being driven by the residential class and that's consistent too, across the footprint.

So when you look at the 6% to 8% earnings and dividends per share growth, the projected share price that we put out -- sorry, earnings per share out in the out years that has assumed a wide variety of potential stock prices. And we put that guidance out after we've gone through that rigorous assessment. So we feel, right now, the current financing strategy is one -- that is one, been successful for us in the past.

The Winter Storm certainly highlighted the importance that reliable natural gas systems, diversified supply portfolios, system versatility, along with underground storage capacity, bring to delivering safe and reliable natural gas service. 
As an example of system modernization and reliability, I want to highlight our third Atmos pipeline storage salt-dome project. This project, nearing 50% completion will provide an additional 5 to 6 Bcf of cavern storage capacity when in full-service late '22 or early '23. 
This new cavern will provide us the continued capability to meet the growing demand in the Dallas Metroplex as well as allow us to safely perform the required regulatory compliance work, while meeting the current needs of our customers. 
Additionally, APT has started our line S2 replacement project that will create an enhanced supply hub to the east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and bring additional supply in from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays. 
We anticipate this 36-inch 90-mile project to be completed in 3 phases, with the final phase being complete in 2023. 
The storm once again highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. After incurring unprecedented gas costs during the storm, we were able to quickly finance these purchases with the issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt for an all-in debt cost of 83.4 basis points. 
This financing is structured to provide us flexibility as we work with our regulators to recover these costs. 
In Kansas and Texas, where we incurred most of our extraordinary gas costs, new legislation was introduced to minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented costs through securitization. 
The legislation in Kansas was signed into law on April 9 and allows utilities to file for the permission from the commission to securitize these costs for a period of up to 32 years. 
In Texas, the legislature is considering a statewide securitization program. Under this program, natural gas utilities would have the opportunity to apply to the Railroad Commission to have their extraordinary costs securitized by the Texas Public Financing Authority and to use the net proceeds to pay off the debt they incurred to finance these natural gas purchases. 
This legislation has been passed by the house and is currently being considered in the Senate. In our remaining states, we anticipate recovering gas costs through our normal purchase gas cost mechanisms over a 12- to 18-month time frame. 
I am very proud of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees in the work they do every day to provide safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their dedication and commitment have Atmos Energy well positioned for success in the second half of the fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to Chris for an update on our financial performance. Chris?"
252684,710742346,2272610,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal '21 second quarter net income of $297 million or $2.30 per share compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $514 million",1324,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal '21 second quarter net income of $297 million or $2.30 per share compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter. 
Year-to-date, earnings were $514 million or $4.01 per share compared with earnings of $418 million or $3.42 per share in the prior year period. 
Our second quarter and year-to-date performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes, driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our Distribution segment, lower O&M spending and a reduction in our annual effective tax rate. 
During the second quarter, APT began refunding $107 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to its customers over a 3-year period. 
Additionally, in Tennessee, we began refunding $17 million in access deferred taxes over a 3-year period. As a reminder, these refunds result in a reduction to revenue and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense resulting in no material impact to our net income. 
Since these excess deferred taxes were approved during the second quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to reflect the lower tax expense that we will realize this fiscal year. 
The application of this lower annual effective tax rate were results from 6 months ended March 31, resulted in an $0.11 benefit during the second quarter. 
However, we can only recognize the associated reduction in revenue as it is built over the last 6 months of the fiscal year. Therefore, this $0.11 benefit will be fully offset during the third and fourth quarters as we build those lower revenues. 
Consolidated operating income increased about 17% to $681 million during the 6 months ended March 31. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. 
Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $130 million. 
Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $11 million as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in several of our service areas. 
For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.87% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.61% net growth across our 8-state footprint. 
We experienced an $8 million decline in service order revenues in our Distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. 
Additionally, our provision for bad debt expense increased almost $9 million in our Distribution segment compared to the same period last year. This combined $17 million decrease represented the most significant impact to our financial performance through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. 
Our commercial sales volumes have turned significantly better than our expectations since the start of the fiscal year. After 15% period-over-period decrease in sales volumes during the first quarter, commercial sales volumes increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and were about 2% higher year-over-year. 
While some of this increase is attributed to the significantly colder weather experienced during the second quarter, commercial sales volumes have trended less than 5% below the 2-year weather-normalized average, which much of that decrease experienced during the first fiscal quarter. 
Throughout the second quarter, we have noted steady improvement as economic activity has started to pick up. 
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt expense, decreased $14 million. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $6 million lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower travel costs. 
O&M in our pipeline and storage setting was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the completion of some nonrecurring well integrity work in the prior year period and conservative O&M management, as we evaluated how our revenues would materialize over the first 6 months of the fiscal year. 
Consolidated capital spending decreased 15% to $846 million, with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending. The decrease largely reflects the timing of spending in our Distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to further enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission network while reducing methane emissions. 
We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact to customer bills while reducing lag. 
To date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And we have currently about $145 million in progress. Slides 27 and 28 summarize the key attributes for these outcomes. And Slide 17 summarizes our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Due to the historic nature of Winter Storm Uri, we experienced unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases during the month of February of approximately $2.3 billion. To help pay for these costs, we completed $2.2 billion of long-term debt financing in March. 
As a reminder, gas costs are a pass-through cost and are recovery in all of our jurisdictions. However, in Kansas and Texas, due to the size of the costs incurred, our regulators issued orders authorizing natural gas utilities to record regulatory assets to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the storm. 
As of March 31, we have recorded a $2.1 billion regulatory asset with approximately $2 billion recorded in Texas and approximately $77 million recorded in Kansas. 
As Kevin mentioned, we have the ability to securitize these costs in Kansas, and we are carefully monitoring the proposed statewide securitization legislation in Texas. 
We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 2.5 million shares for $239 million. And we range forward agreements on 4.5 million shares for approximately $461 million of net proceeds. As of March 31, we have approximately $116 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements, and we have about $313 million available for issuance under the ATM program. 
We intend to satisfy our remaining fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter, was 60.4% as of March 31, and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of liquidity. 
Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slide 7 through 10. 
Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As a reminder, approximately 70% of our Distribution revenues are earned through the first 6 months of the fiscal year. And substantially all of our pipeline, storage and other segments revenues are earned under a straight fixed variable rate design. 
Now that the winter season -- winter heating season is over, we have more clarity around our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we believe fiscal '21 earnings per share will be at the upper end of our guidance range. 
We anticipate our sales volumes to be consistent with what we typically experience during the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate that our service order revenues will consistently with the first 6 months of the fiscal year. 
We've also reflected in this guidance, the decrease in revenue over the last 6 months of the fiscal year as we refund excess deferred taxes to our customers, and we have updated our income tax expense guidance range to reflect the impact of these refunds. 
Finally, we anticipate that O&M will increase modestly during the second half of the fiscal year and be in line with our original O&M guidance range. 
We continue to meet all of our compliance requirements, and we will begin to address some of the system maintenance work we were able to safely delay during the first half of the fiscal year. Slides 11 and 12 provide additional details around our guidance. 
Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

As you heard, we continue to be focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and remain on track to meet our fiscal 2021 targets. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to execute on our strategy that supports our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. 
During our last 2 quarterly calls, I've shared the progress we are making to minimize our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers, including the work we are doing to increase the amount of RNG we have on our system today and to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. 
To date, we are evaluating approximately 30 RNG projects across our systems. As a reminder, our environmental strategy is focused on 5 key areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. 
Today, I want to highlight how Atmos Energy is working to reduce methane emissions as we modernize our business and infrastructure by investing in innovation and technology. 
The following examples of how Atmos Energy will meet our goal to reduce methane emissions 50% by 2035 as well as how we are helping customers understand the role that natural gas plays in reducing their carbon footprint at home in an affordable manner. 
We recently installed a new methane monitoring technology at our TRI Cities underground storage facility called a gas cloud imaging camera. This 360-degree fixed-based camera will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. 
And if necessary, the technology will send alerts, including pop-up alerts with images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts. In addition to our existing methane monitoring and detection equipment, we are finalizing plans to deploy fixed based and mobile technologies throughout our underground storage operations. 
Additionally, we are in the process of installing a fuel cell to generate low-carbon electricity at one of our facilities. The fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint for that facility. 
We anticipate the fuel cell will be operational by the end of this calendar year. With affordability and community support always top of mind for us, our Colorado team partnered with the Greeley Well County Habitate Humanity Group to build a 0-net energy home for a local family. This will be the first of its kind for local habitat homes. 
This home is designed to receive a home energy rating system score of 0, which means the home produces the same amount of energy it consumes over the course of the year by using efficient natural gas appliances, better insulation and solar technology. 
The total utility cost for this home is anticipated to be approximately $350 per year, which is expected to provide about $2,000 in annual utility bill savings relative to the average U.S. home. 
This solution is significantly less expensive than an all-electric home. We are also working with builders in 2 Texas locations to design homes that are expected to yield similar environmental results. 
Our employees put their heart, sole and time and energy into projects like these every day to modernize our system to do our part to protect and preserve our environment for generations to come and to support the communities where they live and work. 
I'm very humbled by their compassionate commitment to be good neighbors. Providing this family with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost-efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. 
Last year, legislation was designed to promote the use of all energy sources and maintain customer energy choice, which we refer to as all fuels legislation, was passed in Louisiana and Tennessee. 
During the second quarter, similar legislation was passed in Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. And earlier this week, the Texas Senate passed HB-17 and it is now on its way to the Governor for signature. 
Assuming it is signed, 6 of our 8 states will have passed All Fuels legislation. 
The successful execution of our strategy and our financial position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and well and into the future. 
I will now open up the call for questions. Dan, I'll turn it back over to you and the operator."

For the quarter -- thank you for explaining part of what drove that year-over-year increase, it seems like there was a timing of the asset lower tax rate, but that's going to be chewed up by the end of the year with no yearly impact. But even without that, it seems like it was a relatively strong quarter versus what we had expected, at least. 
Could you just describe how much of that increase was largely expected by you? Or how much was just an additional benefit, whether it's from rates or nonweather normal volumes? And guiding -- reiterating your guidance, are you positioned pretty well at least at that midpoint at this point?"

I mean the regulatory outcomes were pretty much in line with our expectations, primarily because that reflects the capital spending that we did in the prior fiscal year. So when we made those filings up late last year, they carry over into this year. So we had pretty good visibility into those outcomes. 
I would -- you noted the temporary timing difference around the update to the annual effective tax rate, which will unwind by the end of the year. And then also, 2, we were very conservative on the O&M spending in the first half of the fiscal year as we were able to kind of just take a wait-and-see approach with respect to how our commercial customers, in particular, would behave during the pandemic. 
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the performance there has been better than what we anticipated. So we did hold back some of the spending on the O&M side until we had a better sense where those revenues will begin to materialize. 
And now that we're out of the winter heating season and focused on the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll be modestly increasing that O&M spend. And given the momentum that we see with the regulatory outcomes, the commercial sales volumes beginning to trend in the right direction as economic activity picks up and the fact that we'll do some modest increases on our O&M spending, we feel confident that we'll be at the upper end of the range by the end of the fiscal year."

And there are complications with these acquisitions as we go forward. That's why we like our plan that we have laid out today, the performance that our divisions execute on day in and day out. But I think this transaction sends a very strong signal right to the market. 
In our opinion, it sends a very strong about the value of natural gas that it brings, particularly meeting the energy needs on a go-forward basis, the value of these assets that have been somewhat questioned over time, but are now should be coming into clear focus. 
So I think it sends a very strong signal to everybody about the role that natural gas is playing, continue to play going forward and the value of this infrastructure out there for the reliability, the certainty, the affordability that natural gas brings. 
So very happy to see that have occurred, but remain very, very happy and positive with our regulatory construct and performance of our assets."

I think we'll continue to see these projects come up and with the help of some of these energy firms that are out there. I think we'll continue to see a good opportunity to bring them on our system. But right now, to hang a number on it, I think it's still a little bit early. As I said, we're at the 2% of our overall distribution sales throughput volumes. I think there's opportunity there for us. But until we can get in and see what infrastructure may be required, how near our systems, they are. Is that going to require pipe or what's required on the other side of that through digesters, processing equipment, those sort of things.

So that's continuing to go on. But really, those are things we do each year. And I think one of the strengths, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks for us, is our planning process. Those projects I mentioned are already in our 5-year plan, have been in our 5-year plan to allow us to continue to fortify, grow and think about where those next challenges could be. 
Just, for example, again, the storage piece of that. So as we develop those salt cabins, we're not only thinking about past performance, we're thinking about growth on the system as well. 
And other places to fortify are whether it's APT, infrastructure or distribution systems as well. So I think the ongoing evaluation of that performance continues, but I'm very proud of how our system performed through that, and we'll look for whether it's technology solutions or supply diversification, again, to help us through that. 
And the last thing I'll mention on that is around that supply diversification. You look at -- I'll just use our APT asset as an example here. 
When that supply stopped flowing coming in from the West, from the Permian there, we were able, through the network that we've been building and fortifying and enforcing over the last 10 years to pull from the north out of the Barnett, out of Oklahoma, we fortified that with additional supplies coming out of from East. 
We had our fortifications in place where we could pull from up from the South. All of those points helped us get through that situation during that storm, and we needed all of those and the versatility in the system to be able to pull that and pull it at those levels as well as the many suppliers that we have across those areas to be able to bring those into those points. 
So I'm very proud of how we performed during that period and how our system continues to provide very many options for us going forward."

And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your continued interest in Atmos Energy.
During this quarter, we continued to successfully execute our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems.
This strategy, along with the exceptional dedication and effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy, continue to benefit our customers in the form of safe and reliable natural gas service.
This was clear during Winter Storm Uri as the modernization of our systems, especially over the last 10 years, provided the reliability necessary to meet the human needs requirements of our customers.
I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our gas supply and gas control teams and the many operations, transmission and underground storage employees that dedicated countless hours to keeping natural gas safely flowing during Winter Storm Uri.
The winter storm certainly highlighted the importance that reliable natural gas systems, diversified supply portfolios, system versatility, along with underground storage capacity, bring to delivering safe and reliable natural gas service.
As an example of system modernization and reliability, I want to highlight our third Atmos pipeline storage salt-dome project. This project nearing 50% completion will provide an additional 5 to 6 Bcf of cavern storage capacity when in full service late '22 or early '23.
This new cavern will provide us the continued capability to meet the growing demand in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex as well as allow us to safely perform the required regulatory compliance work, while meeting the current needs of our customers.
Additionally, APT has started our Line S-2 replacement project that will create an enhanced supply hub to the east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and bring additional supply in from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays. We anticipate this 36-inch 90-mile project to be completed in 3 phases, with the final phase being complete in 2023.
The storm once again highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. After incurring unprecedented gas costs during the storm, we were able to quickly finance these purchases with the issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt for an all-in debt cost of 83.4 basis points. This financing is structured to provide us flexibility as we work with our regulators to recover these costs.
In Kansas and Texas, where we incurred most of our extraordinary gas costs, new legislation was introduced to minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented costs through securitization.
The legislation in Kansas was signed into law on April 9 and allows utilities to file for the permission from the commission to securitize these costs for a period of up to 32 years.
In Texas, the legislature is considering a statewide securitization program. Under this program, natural gas utilities would have the opportunity to apply to the Railroad Commission to have their extraordinary costs securitized by the Texas Public Financing Authority and to use the net proceeds to pay off the debt they incurred to finance these natural gas purchases.
This legislation has been passed by the house and is currently being considered in the Senate. In our remaining states, we anticipate recovering gas costs through our normal purchase gas cost mechanisms over a 12- to 18-month time frame.
I am very proud of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees in the work they do every day to provide safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their dedication and commitment have Atmos Energy well positioned for success in the second half of the fiscal year.
I will now turn the call over to Chris for an update on our financial performance. Chris?"
252684,710742346,2272828,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal '21 second quarter net income of $297 million or $2.30 per share compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter.Year-to-date, earnings were $514 million",1333,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal '21 second quarter net income of $297 million or $2.30 per share compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date, earnings were $514 million or $4.01 per share compared with earnings of $418 million or $3.42 per share in the prior year period.
Our second quarter and year-to-date performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes, driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our distribution segment, lower O&M spending and a reduction in our annual effective tax rate.
During the second quarter, APT began refunding $107 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to its customers over a 3-year period.
Additionally, in Tennessee, we began refunding $17 million in excess deferred taxes over a 3-year period. As a reminder, these refunds result in a reduction to revenue and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense resulting in no material impact to our net income.
Since these excess deferred taxes were approved during the second quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to reflect the lower tax expense that we will realize this fiscal year.
The application of this lower annual effective tax rate to our results for 6 months ended March 31, resulted in an $0.11 benefit during the second quarter.
However, we can only recognize the associated reduction in revenue as it is built over the last 6 months of the fiscal year. Therefore, this $0.11 benefit will be fully offset during the third and fourth quarters as we build those lower revenues.
Consolidated operating income increased about 17% to $681 million during the 6 months ended March 31. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments.
Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $130 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $11 million as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in several of our service areas.
For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.87% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.61% net growth across our 8-state footprint. We experienced an $8 million decline in service order revenues in our distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities.
Additionally, our provision for bad debt expense increased almost $9 million in our distribution segment compared to the same period last year. This combined $17 million decrease represented the most significant impact to our financial performance through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.
Our commercial sales volumes have turned significantly better than our expectations since the start of the fiscal year. After 15% period-over-period decrease in sales volumes during the first quarter, commercial sales volumes increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and were about 2% higher year-over-year.
While some of this increase is attributed to the significantly colder weather experienced during the second quarter, commercial sales volumes have trended less than 5% below the 2-year weather-normalized average, which much of that -- much of that decrease experienced during the first fiscal quarter.
Throughout the second quarter, we have noted steady improvement as economic activity has started to pick up. Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt expense, decreased $14 million. O&M in our distribution segment was about $6 million lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower travel costs.
O&M in our pipeline and storage setting was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the completion of some nonrecurring well integrity work in the prior year period and conservative O&M management as we evaluated how our revenues would materialize over the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
Consolidated capital spending decreased 15% to $846 million, with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending. The decrease largely reflects the timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to further enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission network while reducing methane emissions.
We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact to customer bills while reducing lag. To date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And we have currently about $145 million in progress. Slides 27 and 28 summarize the key attributes for these outcomes. And Slide 17 summarizes our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Due to the historic nature of Winter Storm Uri, we experienced unforeseen -- unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases during the month of February of approximately $2.3 billion. To help pay for these costs, we completed $2.2 billion of long-term debt financing in March.
As a reminder, gas costs are a pass-through cost and [ recover ] in all of our jurisdictions. However, in Kansas and Texas, due to the size of the costs incurred, our regulators issued orders authorizing natural gas utilities to record regulatory assets to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the storm.
As of March 31, we have recorded a $2.1 billion regulatory asset with approximately $2 billion recorded in Texas and approximately $77 million recorded in Kansas. As Kevin mentioned, we have the ability to securitize these costs in Kansas, and we are carefully monitoring the proposed statewide securitization legislation in Texas.
We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 2.5 million shares for $239 million. And we settled forward agreements on 4.5 million shares for approximately $461 million of net proceeds. As of March 31, we have approximately $116 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements, and we have about $313 million available for issuance under the ATM program.
We intend to satisfy our remaining fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter, was 60.4% as of March 31, and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slide 7 through 10.
Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As a reminder, approximately 70% of our distribution revenues are earned through the first 6 months of the fiscal year. And substantially all of our pipeline, storage and other segments revenues are earned under a straight fixed variable rate design.
Now that the winter season -- winter heating season is over, we have more clarity around our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we believe fiscal '21 earnings per share will be at the upper end of our guidance range. We anticipate our sales volumes to be consistent with what we typically experience during the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate that our service order revenues will [indiscernible] consistently with the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
We've also reflected in this guidance the decrease in revenue over the last 6 months in the fiscal year as we refund excess deferred taxes to our customers, and we have updated our income tax expense guidance range to reflect the impact of these refunds. Finally, we anticipate that O&M will increase modestly during the second half of the fiscal year and be in line with our original O&M guidance range.
We continue to meet all of our compliance requirements, and we will begin to address some of the system maintenance work we were able to safely delay during the first half of the fiscal year. Slides 11 and 12 provide additional details around our guidance.
Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to execute on our strategy that supports our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services.
During our last 2 quarterly calls, I've shared the progress we are making to minimize our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers, including the work we are doing to increase the amount of RNG we have on our system today and to help customers reduce their carbon emissions.
To date, we are evaluating approximately 30 RNG projects across our systems. As a reminder, our environmental strategy is focused on 5 key areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. Today, I want to highlight how Atmos Energy is working to reduce methane emissions as we modernize our business and infrastructure by investing in innovation and technology.
The following examples of how Atmos Energy will meet our goal to reduce methane emissions 50% by 2035 as well as how we are helping customers understand the role that natural gas plays in reducing their carbon footprint at home in an affordable manner.
We recently installed a new methane monitoring technology at our Tri-Cities underground storage facility called gas cloud imaging camera. This 360-degree fixed base camera will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions.
And if necessary, the technology will send alerts, including pop-up alerts with images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts. In addition to our existing methane monitoring and detection equipment, we are finalizing plans to deploy fixed base and mobile technologies throughout our underground storage operations.
Additionally, we are in the process of installing a fuel cell to generate low-carbon electricity at one of our facilities. The fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint for that facility. We anticipate the fuel cell will be operational by the end of this calendar year. With affordability and community support always top of mind for us, our Colorado team partnered with the Greeley-Weld County Habitat for Humanity Group to build a 0-net energy home for a local family. This will be the first of its kind for local habitat homes.
This home is designed to receive a home energy rating system score of 0, which means the home produces the same amount of energy it consumes over the course of the year by using efficient natural gas appliances, better insulation and solar technology. The total utility cost for this home is anticipated to be approximately $350 per year, which is expected to provide about $2,000 in annual utility bill savings relative to the average U.S. home. This solution is significantly less expensive than an all-electric home. We are also working with builders in 2 Texas locations to design homes that are expected to yield similar environmental results.
Our employees put their heart, sole and time and energy into projects like these every day to modernize our system to do our part to protect and preserve our environment for generations to come and to support the communities where they live and work. I'm very humbled by their compassion and commitment to be good neighbors. Providing this family with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost-efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities.
Last year, legislation was designed to promote the use of all energy sources and maintain customer energy choice, which we refer to as [ alt fuels legislation ], was passed in Louisiana and Tennessee. During the second quarter, similar legislation was passed in Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. And earlier this week, the Texas Senate passed HB 17 and it is now on its way to the Governor for signature. Assuming it is signed, 6 of our 8 states will have passed [ alt fuels legislation ].
The successful execution of our strategy and our financial position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and well and into the future.

For the quarter -- thank you for explaining part of what drove that year-over-year increase. It seems like there was a timing of the asset lower tax rate, but that's going to be trued up by the end of the year with no yearly impact. But even without that, it seems like it was a relatively strong quarter versus what we had expected, at least.
Could you just describe how much of that increase was largely expected by you? Or how much was just an additional benefit, whether it's from rates or nonweather normal volumes? And guiding -- reiterating your guidance, are you positioned pretty well at least at that midpoint at this point?"

I mean the regulatory outcomes were pretty much in line with our expectations, primarily because that reflects the capital spending that we did in the prior fiscal year. So when we made those filings up late last year, they carry over into this year. So we had pretty good visibility into those outcomes.
I would -- you noted the temporary timing difference around the update to the annual effective tax rate, which will unwind by the end of the year. And then also, 2, we were very conservative on the O&M spending in the first half of the fiscal year as we were able to kind of just take a wait-and-see approach with respect to how our commercial customers, in particular, would behave during the pandemic. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the performance there has been better than what we anticipated. So we did hold back some of the spending on the O&M side until we had a better sense where those revenues will begin to materialize.
And now that we're out of the winter heating season and focused on the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll be modestly increasing that O&M spend. And given the momentum that we see with the regulatory outcomes, the commercial sales volumes beginning to trend in the right direction as economic activity picks up and the fact that we'll do some modest increases on O&M spending, we feel confident that we'll be at the upper end of the range by the end of the fiscal year."

We've asked you with a strategic question on M&A before, and obviously, there -- you've talked about how there's robust organic opportunities at most of your jurisdictions. So I definitely appreciate that. But how do you balance, I guess, the valuation that the market is seemingly assigning, given the recent transaction versus the ongoing financing needs you have?

And again, as you heard Chris go through the financial updates, the performance for year-to-date, our historical performance, we remain very happy with our asset mix, our regulatory construct.
And again, Insoo, as you know, we began to earn 90% of our investment in the first 6 months and 99% after 12 months. And we've talked about how that story is very simple, very straightforward, easy for our folks, investors, all stakeholders to understand. And there are complications with these acquisitions as we go forward. That's why we like our plan that we have laid out today, the performance that our divisions execute on day in and day out.
But I think this transaction sends a very strong signal right to the market. In our opinion, it sends a very strong about the value of natural gas that it brings, particularly meeting the energy needs on a go-forward basis, the value of these assets that have been somewhat questioned over time, but are now should be coming into clear focus.
So I think it sends a very strong signal to everybody about the role that natural gas is playing, continue to play going forward and the value of this infrastructure out there for the reliability, the certainty, the affordability that natural gas brings. So very happy to see that have occurred, but remain very, very happy and positive with our regulatory construct and performance of our assets."

That's a little north of the 2% range, I think, when you compare that to about the average distribution sales volumes that we move across our system on an annual basis.
I think we'll continue to see these projects come up, and with the help of some of these energy firms that are out there, I think we'll continue to see a good opportunity to bring them on our system. But right now, to hang a number on it, I think it's still a little bit early. As I said, we're at the 2% of our overall distribution sales throughput volumes. I think there's opportunity there for us. But until we can get in and see what infrastructure may be required, how near are -- our systems they are, is that going to require pipe or what's required on the other side of that through digesters, processing equipment, those sort of things. I think it's still a little bit premature on our side to try and hang a target or a number out there where this could be, but we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that continue to come up."

How we can improve our system, things we can put on our system to monitor that additional supply diversification that we can maybe bring on to our systems.
So that's continuing to go on. But really, those are things we do each year. And I think one of the strengths, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, for us is our planning process. Those projects I mentioned are already in our 5-year plan, have been in our 5-year plan to allow us to continue to fortify, grow and think about where those next challenges could be.
Just, for example, again, the storage piece of that. So as we develop those salt cabins, we're not only thinking about past performance, we're thinking about growth on the system as well. And other places to fortify are whether it's APT, infrastructure or distribution systems as well. So I think the ongoing evaluation of that performance continues, but I'm very proud of how our system performed through that, and we'll look for whether it's technology solutions or supply diversification, again, to help us through that.
And the last thing I'll mention on that is around that supply diversification. You look at -- I'll just use our APT asset as an example here. When that supply stopped flowing coming in from the West, from the Permian there, we were able through the network that we've been building and fortifying and enforcing over the last 10 years to pull from the North out of the Barnett, out of Oklahoma, we fortified that with additional supplies coming out of Carthage from East.
We had our fortifications in place where we could pull from Katy up from the South. All of those points helped us get through that situation during that storm, and we needed all of those and that versatility in the system to be able to pull that and pull it at those levels as well as the many suppliers that we have across those areas to be able to bring those into those points so I'm very proud of how we performed during that period and how our system continues to provide very many options for us going forward."

Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 third quarter net income of $102 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $97 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-",1226,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 third quarter net income of $102 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $97 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $515 million or $4.20 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings in both prior year periods excluded $21 million or $0.17 noncash income tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the enaction of new tax legislation in Kansas. 
Our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the continued execution of our strategy and was in line with our expectations outlined in our last quarterly call. Additionally, our results to the 9 months ended June 30, continue to reflect the impact of refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to our customers. As a reminder, last quarter, we received authorization to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to APT's customers and distribution customers in Tennessee over a 3-year period. During the third quarter and in July, we received authorization to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to distribution customers in Louisiana, Virginia and for certain of our customers in our West Texas division over a 3-year period. The refund of excess deferred taxes is recognized as a reduction in revenue and a reduction in income tax expense. However, there is a timing difference between the recognition of the income tax benefit, which is recognized in our annual effective tax rate when the regulatory orders are approved and the corresponding reduction in revenue, which is recognized over time as it is billed to customers. This timing difference resulted in a $0.06 benefit during the 9 months ended June 30. We anticipate that most of this timing difference will reverse during the fourth quarter. 
Taking a closer look at our performance. Consolidated operating income increased about 13% to $814 million during the 9 months ending June 30. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $170 million. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $15 million as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in virtually all of our service territories. New customer connections increased 1.68% over the last 12 months, and net customer growth over the same period was 1.82%. Sales volumes for commercial customers continue to trend in a favorable direction. Third quarter sales volumes increased 25% over the prior year quarter and were consistent with what we experienced before the pandemic. Year-over-year, commercial sales volumes were 6% higher. 
We experienced an $8.5 million decline in service org revenues in our Distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and rate connections. Additionally, our bad debt expense has increased about $22 million year-over-year. We've been focused on keeping our customers connected to our system by offering more flexible payment arrangements and helping our customers find financial assistance to help with their bills. 
During the third quarter, we resumed collection activities focusing first on the largest past due balances, which are typically the oldest. Additionally, we continue to remain in close contact with our regulators about our customer outreach efforts and we believe this bad debt expense will be recovered over time. 
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, increased $8 million year-over-year and $22 million quarter-over-quarter as we increased pipeline maintenance activities in each of our segments and in-line inspection work at APT. Additionally, we experienced a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locate requests as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage prevention efforts. The O&M spending we experienced during the third quarter was in line with our expectations we outlined during the second quarter call, and is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated capital spending decreased 3% to $1.36 billion, with 80% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability to modernize our system. The slight year-over-year decrease primarily reflects timing of spending in our Distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to modernize our distribution and transmission network to further enhance safety and reliability while reducing methane emissions. 
From a regulatory perspective, we have completed all the filings that will impact fiscal 2021. We are now focused on filings that will impact fiscal '22. To date, we've completed $186 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. As a reminder, many of these regulatory outcomes reflect the lower revenues due to the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities. However, this amount does not include the corresponding reduction in income tax expense. And we currently have about $53 million in progress, most of which is expected to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Slides 13 through 28 provide additional details. From a financing perspective, the third quarter was relatively quiet. During the quarter, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $213 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. We have now priced all of our fiscal 2021 equity needs as well as a portion of our fiscal 2022 equity needs. As we said before, using our ATM equity sales program is our preferred method to meet our planned equity needs. During the third quarter, we issued a new $5 billion shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM equity sales program. The new shelf and ATM program positions us well to meet our future financing needs while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Securitization is also another tool that will help preserve the strength of our balance sheet. On June 16, Governor Rabbot signed House Bill 15.20, Texas statewide securitization program to address the extraordinary gas costs incurred by natural gas utilities during winter storm hearing. Last week, we filed our application to participate in the program, seeking to recover $2 billion. We are currently awaiting a formal procedure schedule from the Texas Railroad Commission. 
We are also making progress with our securitization application in Kansas, anticipate making a filing before the end of the fiscal year. As of June 30, our equity capitalization was 60.2%, excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter, and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slides 7 through 10. 
Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. Based on our third quarter performance and what we are anticipating for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of this range. We anticipate the fourth quarter's activities will mirror what we experienced during the third quarter, with sales volumes consistent with seasonal norms and O&M spending that will be continuing to focus on system maintenance and compliance. 
Slides 11 through 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

I appreciate that financial update for everybody. Over the last year, we have highlighted the progress we are making in the 5 key areas of our environmental strategy, which is focused on reducing our carbon footprint and environmental impact in the areas of gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. One element of the strategy has been to evaluate opportunities to expand the amount of R&D we transport across our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. During the third quarter, our largest RNG suppliers announced plans to expand and modernize their facilities beginning in early calendar 2022. Once completed, their RNG production is expected to grow by approximately 1 Bcf a year. Additionally, an RNG location here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area recently indicated they will soon have the ability to add approximately 1 Bcf a year in RNG transport to our system. So currently, we have almost 7 Bcf of RNG on our system. And once these new projects are fully online, we anticipate this to increase to approximately 9 Bcf or 3% of our distribution sales volumes. I am extremely proud of our gas supply and marketing teams for their continued effort and work to grow opportunities for Atmos Energy customers to utilize RNG. 
In support of our environmental strategy, we recently joined the low carbon resource initiative in June. This initiative currently has over 45 member companies participating and their 5-year initiative to bring industry stakeholders together to accelerate the development and demonstration of low and 0 carbon energy technologies through clean energy research and development. We are proud to be a sponsor of the low-carbon research initiative and has worked to identify cost-effective, reliable and diverse solutions on the path to a clean energy future. Alongside our goal of reducing methane emissions by 50% from 2017 to 2035 and our demonstrated investment in technologies like renewable natural gas and combined heat and power, supporting the low carbon research initiative further reinforces our commitment to the environment through a global platform of collaboration and innovation. And as you just heard, the continued successful execution of our strategy and our strong balance sheet position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We'll take this closing opportunity to thank all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional dedication and commitment to providing safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their efforts continue to be recognized by our customers with an outstanding satisfaction rating for our agents as well as our service technicians in excess of 98%, job well done. 
I will now turn the call back over to Dan and open it up for questions."

So I'm not really going to comment on that today, but we'll update everybody on that come November. But Again, what we're trying to accomplish right now for 2021 is to focus on the system maintenance, some of which we were able to safely defer over the last -- first 6 months of the fiscal year as we waited to see what our customer counts are going to do in commercial sales volumes and so on and so forth. So really, the focus right now is to kind of get back to a more normalized O&M run rate as we see now that the pandemic, at least at this moment isn't impacting our top line revenues in a material way and remain focused on that system maintenance, some of the in-line inspection work. Again, we're also seeing a lot of economic activity, which is driving the line locates. As I mentioned, we had a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, were up 10% year-over-year. So it's a busy time right now, certainly here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and our focus will be to continue to executing on the strategy as we get to the end of the fiscal year."

And we continue to work with our legislators and regulators in Colorado as they're probably the closest to most on putting legislation on the books right now. So I think for us, this fits nicely into our -- as I said earlier on, our overall environmental strategy and the focus areas that we have. We'll keep an eye on these projects as they come to fruition. We'll certainly share those with the regulators and legislators and keep them abreast of the opportunities.

As a reminder, many of these regulatory outcomes reflect the lower revenues due to the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities. However, this amount does not include the corresponding reduction in income tax expense. And we currently have about $53 million in progress, most of which is expected to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Slides 13 through 28 provide additional details. From a financing perspective, the third quarter was relatively quiet. During the quarter, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $213 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. We have now priced all of our fiscal 2021 equity needs as well as a portion of our fiscal 2022 equity needs.
As we said before, using our ATM equity sales program is our preferred method to meet our planned equity needs. During the third quarter, we issued a new $5 billion shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM equity sales program. The new shelf and ATM program positions us well to meet our future financing needs while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.
Securitization is also another tool that will help preserve the strength of our balance sheet. On June 16, Governor Abbott signed House Bill 1520, Texas' statewide securitization program, to address the extraordinary gas costs incurred by natural gas utilities during Winter Storm Uri. Last week, we filed our application to participate in the program, seeking to recover $2 billion. We are currently awaiting a formal procedure schedule from the Texas Railroad Commission.
We are also making progress with our securitization application in Kansas, anticipate making a filing before the end of the fiscal year. As of June 30, our equity capitalization was 60.2%, excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter. And we finished the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slides 7 through 10.
Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. Based on our third quarter performance and what we are anticipating for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe earnings per share will be at the upper end in this range. We anticipate the fourth quarter's activities will mirror what we experienced during the third quarter, with sales volumes consistent with seasonal norms and O&M spending that will be continuing to focus on system maintenance and compliance.
Slides 11 through 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

I appreciate that financial update for everybody. Over the last year, we have highlighted the progress we are making in the 5 key areas of our environmental strategy, which is focused on reducing our carbon footprint and environmental impact in the areas of gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. One element of the strategy has been to evaluate opportunities to expand the amount of R&D we transport across our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions.
During the third quarter, our largest RNG suppliers announced plans to expand and modernize their facilities beginning in early calendar 2022. Once completed, their RNG production is expected to grow by approximately 1 Bcf a year. Additionally, an RNG location here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area recently indicated they will soon have the ability to add approximately 1 Bcf a year in RNG transport to our system. So currently, we have almost 7 Bcf of RNG on our system. And once these new projects are fully online, we anticipate this to increase to approximately 9 Bcf or 3% of our distribution sales volumes. I am extremely proud of our gas supply and marketing teams for their continued effort and work to grow opportunities for Atmos Energy customers to utilize RNG.
In support of our environmental strategy, we recently joined the low carbon resource initiative in June. This initiative currently has over 45 member companies participating and their 5-year initiative to bring industry stakeholders together to accelerate the development and demonstration of low and zero-carbon energy technologies through clean energy research and development. We are proud to be a sponsor of the low-carbon research initiative and has worked to identify cost-effective, reliable and diverse solutions on the path to a clean energy future.
Alongside our goal of reducing methane emissions by 50% from 2017 to 2035 and our demonstrated investment in technologies like renewable natural gas and combined heat and power, supporting the low-carbon research initiative further reinforces our commitment to the environment through a global platform of collaboration and innovation. And as you just heard, the continued successful execution of our strategy and our strong balance sheet position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.
We'll take this closing opportunity to thank all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional dedication and commitment, providing safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their efforts continue to be recognized by our customers with an outstanding satisfaction rating for our agents as well as our service technicians in excess of 98%. Job well done.
I will now turn the call back over to Dan and open it up for questions."

So really, the focus right now is to kind of get back to a more normalized O&M run rate as we see now that the pandemic, at least at this moment, isn't impacting our top line revenues in a material way and remain focused on that system maintenance, some of the in-line inspection work. Again, we're also seeing a lot of economic activity, which is driving the line locates. As I mentioned, we had a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, were up 10% year-over-year. So it's a busy time right now certainly here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and our focus will be to continue to executing on the strategy as we get to the end of the fiscal year."

Second question and for Kevin, you mentioned on the growth in the flow-through of RNG in your system. We were just talking with another company where in Minnesota, a passed legislation there that could potentially give, it seems like, gas utilities way to increase investments in RNG while getting some type of regulated rate of return, although I think there's still some negotiations that need to be had on exactly that process.

So I think for us, this fits nicely into our -- as I said earlier on, our overall environmental strategy and the focus areas that we have.

Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans, who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service.
Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21 once again reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I have said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers or 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.
As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our tenth year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers. As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems to reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our [indiscernible] customers during Winter Storm Uri. Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines, and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline. All to further and enhance system safety and reliability.
Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter-reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services. Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22.
For example, throughout the pandemic, we have increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job site for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.
Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas project and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We are nearly 60% complete with the development of APT's third salt dome storage Cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22 and will provide an additional 5 to 6 Bcf of Cavern storage capacity. We are also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line-X Phase 1 integrity replacement project. And we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22.
As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that moved gas from Waha to Katy. Also nearing completion is the first phase of 3 phases of our Line S-2 project. Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you have heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year '21, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day.
Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%. And 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking.
During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training, and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the following 5 key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers. Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included such things that our ongoing distribution, transmission and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities at APT's Tri-City storage field, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment at APT fields in fiscal '22.
We will also deploy additional wellhead fixed-based or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal '22. We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with [indiscernible] or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced leak detection technologies and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities. We've continued our R&D strategy of identifying customers, who wish to use our system to transport the RNG they produce. We increased the amount of RNG transported across our system to approximately 8 Bcf a year. And we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities at this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities.
In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles into CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first 0 net energy home in partnership with the Greeley Well Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, an installation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We are currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emissions.
In this summer, we joined the low carbon resources initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies. Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at 1 of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility.
To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees through our feeling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year, all by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked community gardens. We hosted utility fairs, energy assistance [indiscernible] to share the warrants for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support. And for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and volunteer resources of our team provided, translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. 
I'm very proud of our team, because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our community. A successful fiscal '21 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy.
I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal '26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you."
252684,1684671715,2435378,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody.

Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 represented an 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. As we entered fiscal '21, we conservatively planned for lower nonresidential revenues while planning to execute our normal O&M program. While nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully manage our O&M spending, focusing on compliance-related activities. Nonresidential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year.
Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed by $0.01 to fiscal '21 results. As a result, actual earnings per share slightly exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth in most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered in fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our Distribution segment declined about $8.5 million, primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year. Full collection activities resumed in the third quarter, and we continue to offer futile payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time.
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work and continued record establishment and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts. Capital and spending increased to $2 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. In fiscal '21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases, excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities.
Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement with regulators to implement an additional $69 million in annualized operating income during our first quarter -- our fiscal 2022, 1st quarter. As of today, we have 4 filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal '21 equity needs to our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall. 
Additionally, we improved our fiscal -- financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended and increased in liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retains the $250 million accordion feature. And we replaced our expiring 364-day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide, improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm Uri. 
Additionally, we issued a new $5 billion shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps. Currently, we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. 
Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job and outstanding for $2.2 billion in cost-effective interim financing to take the gas costs incurred during Winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluded the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.
We've also prepared a winter operations in this fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain and inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply team has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full at a weighted average cost of gas of approximately $3. Additionally, we have fiscally and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements at approximately $4. Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately half of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range. The remainder of anticipated gas supply needs, we satisfied through a combination of base loan purchases at first month prices, peaking contracts and spot purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint, which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.
As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact on customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers by how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices from energy conservation as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2.72, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '21. Finally, fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to rise by 25% and is expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22, as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of our fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our -- underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.40. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization and Byron improvements and system expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate total spending of approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21.
From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million, and we have assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes that are currently being considered at the federal level.
From a financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy that we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion of incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal '21.
In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85%. After factoring in the favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing. 
Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be a [indiscernible] method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22, and we expect to raise our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Railroad Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of a regulatory asset that will be securitized under the statewide program. The final [indiscernible] stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs were prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. 
Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed a securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions and a procedural schedule has been set with full proceedings expected to begin in January. 
Finally, annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means to which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '26. In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings from $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years '22 and '23. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6% to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026. 
And as you can see on Slide 25, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which should help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth at yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share, commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate base is situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdictions support the necessary capital investment to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. 
We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years, as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you have heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. Eight of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. 
Additionally, our Middle Tennessee service territory ranks among the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. as well. We continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 Bcf per year once they are fully online. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries. 
Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities, delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions."

I'm going to step back a little bit on this question. Atmos is in a really interesting situation. You have perhaps the fastest growth rate in terms of your rate base among companies we cover. We love the growth outlook. What's interesting is that the amount of equity needed compared to your market cap is high -- And the value of the stock, the PE multiple of the stock is dramatically lower than what we're seeing in sort of private asset sales, including not just sales of 100%, but sort of just selling a minority stake, we've seen dramatically higher valuations. So I guess the math might suggest that sort of a sale of a minority stake at the kinds of multiples we've been seeing on other situations would be dramatically less dilutive than than this kind of volume of equity issuance that we're looking at over the next 5 years, how do you all kind of think about the possibility of selling noncontrolling minority stakes potentially much higher valuations than just where your own stock is trading? How do you all think about that?"

It would have to be a partial asset sale or a certain geographic region that we would have to exit. And as you heard Kevin talk earlier with Cody, we're very, very happy with the assets that we have, the jurisdictional footprints. We do see the dislocation between what the private market is place a valuation on versus what we're seeing from a publicly traded perspective. And we think, again, from a public perspective, the fact that 97% of our asset base is located in jurisdictions that are supportive of natural gas, both from a policy perspective and a regulatory perspective. The fact that we have very strong customer growth is currently being a little bit underappreciated. And that's where we just need to continue to remind those investors that we are very well positioned in the country to capture the growth that is experienced in our jurisdictions and have jurisdictions that have strong support for natural gas."

Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans, who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service.
Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21 once again reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I have said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers our 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.
As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our tenth year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers. As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems to reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our human needs customers during Winter Storm Uri. Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines, and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline. All to further and enhance system safety and reliability.
Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter-reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services. Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22.
For example, throughout the pandemic, we have increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job site for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.
Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas project and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We are nearly 60% complete with the development of APT's third salt dome storage Cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22 and will provide an additional 5 to 6 Bcf of Cavern storage capacity. We are also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line-X Phase 1 integrity replacement project. And we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22.
As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. Also nearing completion is the first phase of 3 phases of our Line S-2 project. Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you have heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year '21, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day.
Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%. And 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking.
During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training, and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the following 5 key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers. Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included such things that our ongoing distribution, transmission and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities at APT's Tri-City storage field, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment at APT fields in fiscal '22.
We will also deploy additional wellhead fixed-based or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal '22. We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with no bleed or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced leak detection technologies and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities. We've continued our R&D strategy of identifying customers, who wish to use our system to transport the RNG they produce. We increased the amount of RNG transported across our system to approximately 8 Bcf a year. And we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities at this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities.
In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles into CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first 0 net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, and installations produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We are currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emissions.
In this summer, we joined the low carbon resources initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies. Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at one of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility.
To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees through our feeling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year, all by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked in community gardens. We hosted utility fairs, energy assistance just to share the warmth for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support. And for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and volunteer resources of our team provided, translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. 
I'm very proud of our team, because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our community. A successful fiscal '21 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy.
I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal '26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you."
252684,1684671715,2435733,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 represented an 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results includ",2193,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 represented an 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. As we entered fiscal '21, we conservatively planned for lower nonresidential revenues while planning to execute our normal O&M program. While nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully managed our O&M spending, focusing on compliance-related activities. Nonresidential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year.
Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed about $0.01 to fiscal '21 results. As a result, actual earnings per share slightly exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth in most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered in fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our Distribution segment declined about $8.5 million, primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year. Full collection activities resumed in the third quarter, and we continue to offer flexible payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time.
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work and continued record establishment and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts. Capital and spending increased to $2 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. In fiscal '21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases, excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities.
Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement with regulators to implement an additional $69 million in annualized operating income during our first quarter -- our fiscal 2022, first quarter. As of today, we have 4 filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall. 
Additionally, we improved our fiscal -- financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended and increased liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retains the $250 million accordion feature. And we replaced our expiring 364-day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide, improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm Uri. 
Additionally, we issued a new $5 billion shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps. Currently, we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. 
Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job and outstanding for $2.2 billion in cost-effective interim financing to pay for the gas costs incurred during Winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.
We've also prepared a winter operations in this fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain and inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply team has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full at a weighted average cost of gas of approximately $3. Additionally, we have fiscally and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements at approximately $4. Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately half of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range. The remainder of anticipated gas supply needs, we satisfy through a combination of base loan purchases at first month prices, peaking contracts and spot purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint, which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.
As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact on customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers by how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices from energy conservation as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2.72, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '21. Finally, fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to rise by 25% and is expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22, as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of our fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our -- underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.40. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization and environmental improvements and system expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate total spending of approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21.
From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million, and we have assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes that are currently being considered at the federal level.
From a financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy that we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion of incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal '26.
In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85%. After factoring in the favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing. 
Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be our preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22, and we expect to raise our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Railroad Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of a regulatory asset that will be securitized under the statewide program. The final order stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs were prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. 
Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed a securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions and a procedural schedule has been set with full proceedings expected to begin in January. 
Finally, annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means to which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '26. In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings from $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years '22 and '23. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6% to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026. 
And as you can see on Slide 25, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which should help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth at yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share, commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate base is situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdictions support the necessary capital investment to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. 
We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years, as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you have heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. Eight of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. 
Additionally, our Middle Tennessee service territory ranks among the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. as well. We continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 Bcf per year once they are fully online. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries. 
Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities, delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions."

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and I'm glad you could join us this morning. On this Veteran's Day, I would like to take just a moment to say thank you to those who have served in our Armed Forces. Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans, who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service.
Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21 once again reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I have said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers our 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.
As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our tenth year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers.
As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems the reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our human needs customers during Winter Storm Uri. Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines, and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline, all to further enhance system safety and reliability.
Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter-reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services. Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction.
I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22.
For example, throughout the pandemic, we have increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job sites for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.
Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas projects and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We are nearly 60% complete with the development of APT's third salt dome storage Cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22 and will provide an additional 5 to 6 Bcf of Cavern storage capacity. We are also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line-X Phase 1 integrity replacement project. And we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22.
As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. Also nearing completion is the first phase of 3 phases of our Line S-2 project. Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you have heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year '21, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day.
Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%. And 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking.
During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training, and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the following 5 key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers.
Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included such things as our ongoing distribution, transmission and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities at APT's Tri-City storage field, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment at APT fields in fiscal '22.
We will also deploy additional wellhead fixed-based or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal '22. We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with no bleed or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced leak detection technologies and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities.
We've continued our R&D strategy of identifying customers, who wish to use our system to transport the RNG they produce. We increased the amount of RNG transported across our system to approximately 8 Bcf a year. And we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities at this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities.
In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles and to CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first 0 net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, and installations to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We are currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emissions.
In this summer, we joined the Low Carbon Resources Initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies. Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at one of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility.
To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees through our Fueling Safe and Thriving Communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year, all by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked in community gardens. We hosted utility fairs, energy assistance just to share the warmth for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support. And for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and volunteer resources of our team provided, translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. 
I'm very proud of our team, because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our community. A successful fiscal '21 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy.
I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal '26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you."
252684,1684671715,2466176,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 represented an 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results includ",2194,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 represented an 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas.
As we entered fiscal '21, we conservatively planned for lower nonresidential revenues while planning to execute our normal O&M program. While nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully managed our O&M spending, focusing on compliance-related activities. Nonresidential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year.
Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed about $0.01 to fiscal '21 results. As a result, actual earnings per share slightly exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth in most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered in fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our Distribution segment declined about $8.5 million, primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year. Full collection activities resumed in the third quarter, and we continue to offer flexible payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time.
Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work and continued records establishment and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts.
Capital and spending increased to $2 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. In fiscal '21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases, excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities.
Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement with regulators to implement an additional $69 million in annualized operating income during our first quarter -- our fiscal 2022, first quarter. As of today, we have 4 filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall. 
Additionally, we improved our fiscal -- financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended and increased liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retains the $250 million accordion feature. And we replaced our expiring 364-day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide, improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm Uri. 
Additionally, we issued a new $5 billion shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps. Currently, we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. 
Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job and outstanding for $2.2 billion in cost-effective interim financing to pay for the gas costs incurred during Winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and a financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.
We've also prepared a winter operations in this fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply team has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full at a weighted average cost of gas of approximately $3. Additionally, we have fiscally and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements at approximately $4.
Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately half of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range. The remainder of anticipated gas supply needs, will be satisfied through a combination of base loan purchases at first month prices, peaking contracts and spot purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint, which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.
As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact on customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers by how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices from energy conservation as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2.72, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '21.
Finally, fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to rise by 25% and is expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which will represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22, as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of our fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our -- underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.40. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization, environmental improvements and system expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate total spending of approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21.
From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million, and we have assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes that are currently being considered at the federal level.
From a financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy that we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion of incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal '26.
In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85%. After factoring in the favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing. 
Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be our preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22, and we expect to raise our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Railroad Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of a regulatory asset that will be securitized under the statewide program. The final order stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs were prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. 
Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed a securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions and a procedural schedule has been set with full proceedings expected to begin in January. 
Finally, annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '26.
In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings from $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years '22 and '23. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6% to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026. 
And as you can see on Slide 25, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which should help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?"

Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth at yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share, commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate base is situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdictions support the necessary capital investment to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. 
We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years, as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you have heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. Eight of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. 
Additionally, our Middle Tennessee service territory ranks among the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. as well. We continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 Bcf per year once they are fully online. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries. 
Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities, delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions."

You've heard us talk before that we're in a mode now of doing more compliance work every year rather than holding back and waiting for another rate case to occur. So as we continue to look at the rulemaking that's happening at the federal and the state level, we work to try to get ahead of that, so that when it comes time for a compliance deadline to be met, we're getting there well in advance of when that deadline is. And we're also just looking at just the system needs and what we want to be doing from a safety perspective. So we talked about advanced leak detection technologies and further expanding that across our footprint as well as just ongoing hydro testing and in-line inspection work on our large-scale distribution in some of our transmission lines to make sure that our system is operating as safely as it possibly can."

The rest of it, at this point, we're still working our way through the detailed piece of that with our peer companies and with the American Gas Association."
