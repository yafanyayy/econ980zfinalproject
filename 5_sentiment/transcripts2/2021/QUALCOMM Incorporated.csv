Fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with record first quarter non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion, up 63% year-over-year and record non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share. More than doubling from the prior year. The simultaneous global adoption of 5G, combined with increasingly complex technical requirements and a pace of change that is accelerating drives a significant multiyear industry transition that plays to our strength.
QCT revenues of $6.5 billion were also a record, up 81% year-over-year and 32% sequentially. Notably, our strong performance and outlook would have been even stronger had we not been supply constrained. Within QCT, we saw strength across our portfolio.
Our RF adjacency demonstrated continued growth with quarterly revenues more than doubling year-over-year and crossing the $1 billion threshold, a significant milestone. We are executing extremely well in our strategy to address many of the technical challenges of delivering a true modem to antenna 5G experience and capture a higher dollar share of content in smartphones.
We are also well positioned with design wins across the mobile handset ecosystem. A strong pipeline for further growth in smartphones and a road map to bring our RF expertise to adjacent industries.
Our automotive revenues of $212 million were up 44% year-over-year, and our design win pipeline has grown to $8.3 billion from just $3 billion 3 years ago. Placing us on a trajectory to achieve our fiscal year 2024 revenue target of $1.5 billion.
Our IoT adjacency also passed the $1 billion threshold in Q1 and grew 48% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our core technologies for the digitization of consumer, networking and industrial applications. Our team continues to execute extremely well in spite of supply constraints and the continued impact of the pandemic. Our strategy is playing out largely as we expected, positioning us well to capture the rapid deployment of 5G in both the core handset industry as well as creating new opportunities in adjacencies.
In our licensing business, our broad portfolio of foundational system-level innovations and intellectual properties across 3G, 4G and 5G, along with valuable implementation patents is unmatched and recognized in part by having signed more than 120 5G license agreements, up from 111 license agreements last quarter. Our continued success in-licensing reflects our development of foundational technologies enabling 5G standards coupled with leadership in developing the standards themselves.
Leadership in developing the products necessary to implement 5G technology and leadership in enabling the industry to rapidly implement 5G seamlessly worldwide. This process continues through the successive releases of 5G currently under development as our foundational innovations, coupled with our ability to implement 5G in products and coordinated deployment in new verticals continues to drive progress outside the handset industry.
We continue to invest in complementary technologies that will enable the adoption of 5G use cases that will benefit consumers and businesses in a variety of industries as well as agriculture and the advanced important social objectives of both urban and rural environments, including improvements in health care and education in a more widely connected future.
We have also spent the past decade deep in AI research and development. Resulting in the creation of the technology necessary to scale AI across industries and products from smartphones and automotive to the IoT and data centers. To make AI ubiquitous, we focused on making efficient hardware, algorithmic advancements and software tools available to developers and OEMs. We believe AI will transform industries and our technologies will help accelerate the commercialization and scale of AI, making AI ubiquitous around the globe.
Our commitment to our high-performance processor road map was reflected in our recently announced proposed acquisition of NUVIA. We look forward to combining NUVIA's world-class CPU and technology design team with Snapdragon enable our ecosystem of customers to redefine computing performance, drive innovation and deliver a new class of products and experiences for the 5G era.
Just 2 years ago, we first announced our Snapdragon 855 mobile platform, the world's first commercial platform supporting multi-gigabit 5G and demonstrated end-to-end 5G consumer experiences with real demos over live millimeter wave 5G networks and devices. Today, we have an expanding portfolio of differentiated 5G solutions across multiple tiers of our Snapdragon mobile platforms.
With high-performance basebands, advanced RF front end designs and leading-edge process nodes for our flagship solutions, we are well positioned to address growing 5G demand in the handset space and across our adjacencies. In RF, our position today is the result of executing on our strategy to extend the breadth of the products we offer. In just a few years, we have emerged as one of the largest RF suppliers in the smartphone ecosystem with a long-term road map, supporting 4G and 5G sub-6 bands in addition to 5G millimeter bands enabling us to expand our RF leadership into end product applications.
The automotive industry continues to change rapidly, and the car is becoming more connected, more autonomous and more electric. As these trends disrupt the industry, 5G connectivity and new experiences and user demands such as always connected digital cabins for infotainment, real-time navigation and entertainment are becoming the new standard. We are working to meet the increasing demands of safe and premium driving experiences powered by 4G LTE and 5G connected services.
With integrated cellular V2x, Wifi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, our 4G and 5G platforms are designed to securely connect vehicles to the cloud, each other and the surrounding environment. With over 150 million vehicles on the road today connected with our modems, we are a leader in automotive telematics. We are evolving our strong position in automotive telematics, to a strategic industry partner building incumbency with continued innovation as the auto industry undergoes rapid transformation.
Our third-generation automotive cockpit solutions have been selected by 20 of the top 25 automakers and our recently announced fourth generation automotive platform demonstrates our leadership in high-performance compute, computer vision, artificial intelligence and multi-sensor processing.
Lastly, our recently announced strategic engagements with General Motors and leading Tier 1 suppliers, including LG Electronics, Google, Panasonic and Visteon, are further evidence of our strong alignment with the automotive industry.
Turning to IoT. We continue to drive momentum and compute with the launch of our second-generation Snapdragon HCX, the introduction of our commercial and educational platforms for both Windows and Chrome and continued ecosystem progress. We are also driving industry leadership in XR with over 40 design wins and strong ecosystem momentum with global operator partnerships. We believe XR has the potential to be the next computing platform.
Our networking solutions target the full potential of Wi-Fi 6 with a blend of advanced technologies and protocols, targeting networks deployed in enterprise, venue and prosumer applications. We are also extending our advanced Wi-Fi 6 feature profile into the 6 gigahertz spectrum with second-generation platforms. We are capitalizing on the transformation in private and public networks, enabling millimeter wave indoor and outdoor launches in North America and Japan with our small cell solution, bringing higher reliability and speeds to consumers, as well as providing connectivity for 5G enterprise private networks of the future.
Lastly, we are accelerating deployment of our core technologies for digitization, of nonmobile industries across retail, utilities, transportation and manufacturing applications. It is exciting to see the strategy we laid out several years ago, playing out largely as expected, and placing Qualcomm in a very strong position for Cristiano to carry the vision forward as he executes on the many opportunities in front of us over many years.
Being CEO of Qualcomm for the last 7 years has been a privilege and an honor. The foundation of Qualcomm's leadership is a relentless commitment to innovating with great products, focusing on large industries with technical challenges that are hard to solve. This is what always gave me the confidence we would succeed even when it wasn't obvious, and I have every confidence Cristiano shares this vision.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

We're extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered a record first quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.17, which was above the high end o",864,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We're extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered a record first quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.17, which was above the high end of the strong guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 63% and 119% in revenues and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT.
In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.66 billion, up 18% year-over-year and EBIT margins of 77%. In the December quarter, we saw a year-over-year reduction of 7% in global 3G, 4G, 5G handset shipments compared to our planning assumption of a 5% reduction, reflecting the impact of COVID and softness in the domestic China shipments. In QCT, we delivered record results with revenues of $6.5 billion, up 32% sequentially and 81% year-over-year. These results were driven by strength across handsets, RF front end, automotive and IoT. Our strong revenue growth drove EBT margins of 29%, which was above the high end of our guidance and increased 900 basis points sequentially as we realize the benefit of operating leverage.
We're also pleased with our continued diversification as we delivered record revenues in RF front end, automotive and IoT. Our front-end revenues of $1.1 billion more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the strength of our broad product portfolio across all frequency bands and customers.
Automotive revenues of $212 million grew 44% year-over-year as our telematics and digital cockpit products continue to benefit from the industry rebound. In IoT, revenues grew 48% year-over-year to $1 billion across consumer, networking and industrial applications, driven by an acceleration in demand for our products and technologies.
Our non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.78 billion was lower than our previous estimate, primarily due to the timing of certain R&D expenses within the fiscal year.
Turning to 5G adoption. We estimate approximately 225 million 5G handsets in calendar 2020 and forecast 450 million to 550 million units in calendar 2021. We're extremely pleased by the adoption of our 5G chipsets across OEM partners with over 800 designs using 5G modem and RF solutions. Our recently announced 5G premium tier mobile platform, the Snapdragon 888 already has over 120 design wins. We now have 5G offerings across several tiers from our premium tier Snapdragon 888 to our recently announced Snapdragon 480, all capable of supporting millimeter wave.
For global 3G/4G/5G handsets, we estimate that shipments declined 12% on a year-over-year basis in calendar 2020. In calendar 2021, we expect total handsets to grow in high single digits year-over-year. This assumes an impact from COVID in the first half, consistent with the exit rate of 2020 and a recovery in the second half. In addition, QCT's addressable market will expand to include Huawei's existing share, which is estimated to be approximately 16% of total handsets in 2019.
Turning to our second quarter guidance. We are forecasting revenues of $7.2 billion to $8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.75, a year-over-year increase of 46% and 88%, respectively, at the midpoint. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion, and EBT margins of 66% to 70%. This is in line with normal seasonality following the strong holiday quarter, and reflects the slightly lower handset forecast I previously outlined.
In QCT, we expect revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, up 52% year-over-year and EBT margins of 23% to 25%, reflecting EBT dollar growth of 125% versus the year ago quarter. Consistent with historical trends, we estimate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be up 5% to 6% sequentially due to normal calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. We estimate that the pending acquisition of NUVIA will increase fiscal '21 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses by approximately $100 million, a portion of which is contemplated in our second quarter guidance.
Looking forward to the third fiscal quarter, we estimate QTL revenues to be in a similar range as our second quarter guidance and expect QCT earnings to double on a year-over-year basis. This forecast contemplates the current seasonality of the QCT business following the strength in the first half of the fiscal year, which was driven by 5G flagship launches, including Apple, the holiday season and Chinese New Year. In addition, we are seeing demand significantly outpacing supply given the constraints affecting the industry.
Beyond the third quarter, we continue to forecast strong growth across QCT, driven by new device launches, design win traction and strength in our adjacent platforms. Lastly, we launched our latest annual corporate responsibility and ESG report yesterday, which is now available on our website.
I'm pleased to share that we have successfully met or exceeded our 2020 goals and have disclosed 2025 targets focused across key areas of diversity and inclusion, purposeful innovation and reducing our carbon footprint. We continue to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders to disclose ESG information in alignment with international standards.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and focused execution. I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

We're not seeing any significant inventory build in the channels. So let me just maybe clarify that to start with. If you think about QTL revenues sequentially from December quarter to March quarter, we've talked about seasonality in that business consistently in the past. And so our guidance really reflects that. So it's no different than kind of the shape of the year that you generally see in the handset market and mix of OEMs being reflected in the dollars. So in the past, we talked about $1.7 billion midpoint, going to $1.4 billion from December to March. And what we are guiding is we came in just below the midpoint in the December quarter, and we're guiding similarly just below the $1.4 billion for the March quarter. So that's the message on QTL.
On QCT, clearly, with Apple now in our revenue stream, there's a different seasonality than we've had in the past. And so you see kind of that becoming a factor. But when you take -- remove that, our seasonality is actually extremely strong with significant growth from December to March quarter. And really strength across not just mobile platform with the launch of our Snapdragon 888 chipset but also across RFFE, auto and IoT being strong as well. So it's really strength across the board. And what you see in the numbers is the seasonality of the revenue profile showing up."

As we've said in the past, we feel like we have the ability to hold margins in the -- in consistent with our recent history and potential upside opportunity to grow it. And so we still have the same view. And operating margin will then just become kind of something that falls out based on the revenue profile.

Fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with record first quarter non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion, up 63% year-over-year and record non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share, more than doubling from the prior year. The simultaneous global adoption of 5G, combined with increasingly complex technical requirements and a pace of change that is accelerating drives a significant multiyear industry transition that plays to our strength. 
QCT revenues of $6.5 billion were also a record, up 81% year-over-year and 32% sequentially. Notably, our strong performance and outlook would have been even stronger had we not been supply constrained. Within QCT, we saw strength across our portfolio. 
Our RF adjacency demonstrated continued growth with quarterly revenues more than doubling year-over-year and crossing the $1 billion threshold, a significant milestone. We are executing extremely well on our strategy to address many of the technical challenges of delivering a true modem to antenna 5G experience and capture a higher dollar share of content in smartphones. 
We are also well positioned with design wins across the mobile handset ecosystem, a strong pipeline for further growth in smartphones and a road map to bring our RF expertise to adjacent industries. 
Our automotive revenues of $212 million were up 44% year-over-year, and our design win pipeline has grown to $8.3 billion from just $3 billion 3 years ago, placing us on a trajectory to achieve our fiscal year 2024 revenue target of $1.5 billion. 
Our IoT adjacency also passed the $1 billion threshold in Q1 and grew 48% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our core technologies for the digitization of consumer, networking and industrial applications. Our team continues to execute extremely well in spite of supply constraints and the continued impact of the pandemic. Our strategy is playing out largely as we expected, positioning us well to capture the rapid deployment of 5G in both the core handset industry as well as creating new opportunities in adjacencies. 
In our licensing business, our broad portfolio of foundational system-level innovations and intellectual properties across 3G, 4G and 5G, along with valuable implementation patents is unmatched and recognized in part by having signed more than 120 5G license agreements, up from 111 license agreements last quarter. Our continued success in-licensing reflects our development of foundational technologies enabling 5G standards coupled with leadership in developing the standards themselves. 
Leadership in developing the products necessary to implement 5G technology and leadership in enabling the industry to rapidly implement 5G seamlessly worldwide. This process continues through the successive releases of 5G currently under development as our foundational innovations, coupled with our ability to implement 5G in products and coordinated deployment in new verticals continues to drive progress outside the handset industry. 
We continue to invest in complementary technologies that will enable the adoption of 5G use cases that will benefit consumers and businesses in a variety of industries as well as agriculture and the advanced important social objectives of both urban and rural environments, including improvements in health care and education in a more widely connected future. 
We have also spent the past decade deep in AI research and development, resulting in the creation of the technology necessary to scale AI across industries and products from smartphones and automotive to the IoT and data centers. To make AI ubiquitous, we focused on making efficient hardware, algorithmic advancements and software tools available to developers and OEMs. We believe AI will transform industries and our technologies will help accelerate the commercialization and scale of AI, making AI ubiquitous around the globe. 
Our commitment to our high-performance processor road map was reflected in our recently announced proposed acquisition of NUVIA. We look forward to combining NUVIA's world-class CPU and technology design team with Snapdragon enable our ecosystem of customers to redefine computing performance, drive innovation and deliver a new class of products and experiences for the 5G era. 
Just 2 years ago, we first announced our Snapdragon 855 mobile platform, the world's first commercial platform supporting multi-gigabit 5G and demonstrated end-to-end 5G consumer experiences with real demos over live millimeter wave 5G networks and devices. Today, we have an expanding portfolio of differentiated 5G solutions across multiple tiers of our Snapdragon mobile platforms. 
With high-performance basebands, advanced RF front end designs and leading-edge process nodes for our flagship solutions, we are well positioned to address growing 5G demand in the handset space and across our adjacencies. In RF, our position today is the result of executing on our strategy to extend the breadth of the products we offer. In just a few years, we have emerged as one of the largest RF suppliers in the smartphone ecosystem with a long-term road map, supporting 4G and 5G sub-6 bands in addition to 5G millimeter bands enabling us to expand our RF leadership into end product applications. 
The automotive industry continues to change rapidly, and the car is becoming more connected, more autonomous and more electric. As these trends disrupt the industry, 5G connectivity and new experiences and user demands such as always connected digital cabins for infotainment, real-time navigation and entertainment are becoming the new standard. We are working to meet the increasing demands of safe and premium driving experiences powered by 4G LTE and 5G connected services. 
With integrated cellular V2x, Wifi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, our 4G and 5G platforms are designed to securely connect vehicles to the cloud, each other and the surrounding environment. With over 150 million vehicles on the road today connected with our modems, we are a leader in automotive telematics. We are evolving our strong position in automotive telematics to a strategic industry partner building incumbency with continued innovation as the auto industry undergoes rapid transformation. 
Our third-generation automotive cockpit solutions have been selected by 20 of the top 25 automakers and our recently announced fourth generation automotive platform demonstrates our leadership in high-performance computer vision, artificial intelligence and multi-sensor processing. 
Lastly, our recently announced strategic engagements with General Motors and leading Tier 1 suppliers, including LG Electronics, Google, Panasonic and Visteon, are further evidence of our strong alignment with the automotive industry. 
Turning to IOT. We continue to drive momentum in compute with the launch of our second-generation Snapdragon HCX, the introduction of our commercial and educational platforms for both Windows and Chrome and continued ecosystem progress. We are also driving industry leadership in XR with over 40 design wins and strong ecosystem momentum with global operator partnerships. We believe XR has the potential to be the next computing platform. 
Our networking solutions target the full potential of Wi-Fi 6 with a blend of advanced technologies and protocols, targeting networks deployed in enterprise, venue and prosumer applications. We are also extending our advanced Wi-Fi 6 feature profile into the 6 gigahertz spectrum with second-generation platforms. We are capitalizing on the transformation in private and public networks, enabling millimeter wave indoor and outdoor launches in North America and Japan with our small cell solution, bringing higher reliability and speeds to consumers as well as providing connectivity for 5G enterprise private networks of the future. 
Lastly, we are accelerating deployment of our core technologies for digitization of nonmobile industries across retail, utilities, transportation and manufacturing applications. It is exciting to see the strategy we laid out several years ago, playing out largely as expected, and placing Qualcomm in a very strong position for Cristiano to carry the vision forward as he executes on the many opportunities in front of us over many years. 
Being CEO of Qualcomm for the last 7 years has been a privilege and an honor. The foundation of Qualcomm's leadership is a relentless commitment to innovating with great products, focusing on large industries with technical challenges that are hard to solve. This is what always gave me the confidence we would succeed even when it wasn't obvious, and I have every confidence Cristiano shares this vision. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

We're extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered a record first quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.17, which was above the high end o",863,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We're extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered a record first quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.17, which was above the high end of the strong guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 63% and 119% in revenues and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. 
In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.66 billion, up 18% year-over-year and EBT margins of 77%. In the December quarter, we saw a year-over-year reduction of 7% in global 3G, 4G, 5G handset shipments compared to our planning assumption of a 5% reduction, reflecting the impact of COVID and softness in the domestic China shipments. In QCT, we delivered record results with revenues of $6.5 billion, up 32% sequentially and 81% year-over-year. These results were driven by strength across handsets, RF front end, automotive and IoT. Our strong revenue growth drove EBT margins of 29%, which was above the high end of our guidance and increased 900 basis points sequentially as we realize the benefit of operating leverage. 
We're also pleased with our continued diversification as we delivered record revenues in RF front-end, automotive and IoT. RF front-end revenues of $1.1 billion more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the strength of our broad product portfolio across all frequency bands and customers. 
Automotive revenues of $212 million grew 44% year-over-year as our telematics and digital cockpit products continue to benefit from the industry rebound. In IoT, revenues grew 48% year-over-year to $1 billion across consumer, networking and industrial applications, driven by an acceleration in demand for our products and technologies. 
Our non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.78 billion was lower than our previous estimate, primarily due to the timing of certain R&D expenses within the fiscal year. 
Turning to 5G adoption. We estimate approximately 225 million 5G handsets in calendar 2020 and forecast 450 million to 550 million units in calendar 2021. We're extremely pleased by the adoption of our 5G chipsets across OEM partners with over 800 designs using 5G modem and RF solutions. Our recently announced 5G premium tier mobile platform, the Snapdragon 888 already has over 120 design wins. We now have 5G offerings across several tiers from our premium tier Snapdragon 888 to our recently announced Snapdragon 480, all capable of supporting millimeter wave. 
For global 3G/4G/5G handsets, we estimate that shipments declined 12% on a year-over-year basis in calendar 2020. In calendar 2021, we expect total handsets to grow in high single digits year-over-year. This assumes an impact from COVID in the first half, consistent with the exit rate of 2020 and a recovery in the second half. In addition, QCT's addressable market will expand to include Huawei's existing share, which is estimated to be approximately 16% of total handsets in 2019. 
Turning to our second quarter guidance. We are forecasting revenues of $7.2 billion to $8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.75, a year-over-year increase of 46% and 88%, respectively, at the midpoints. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion, and EBITDA margins of 66% to 70%. This is in line with normal seasonality following the strong holiday quarter, and reflects the slightly lower handset forecast I previously outlined. 
In QCT, we expect revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, up 52% year-over-year and EBT margins of 23% to 25%, reflecting EBT dollar growth of 125% versus the year ago quarter. Consistent with historical trends, we estimate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be up 5% to 6% sequentially due to normal calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. We estimate that the pending acquisition of NUVIA will increase fiscal '21 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses by approximately $100 million, a portion of which is contemplated in our second quarter guidance. 
Looking forward to the third fiscal quarter, we estimate QTL revenues to be in a similar range as our second quarter guidance and expect QCT earnings to double on a year-over-year basis. This forecast contemplates the current seasonality of the QCT business following the strength in the first half of the fiscal year, which was driven by 5G flagship launches, including Apple, the holiday season and Chinese New Year. In addition, we are seeing demand significantly outpacing supply given the constraints affecting the industry. 
Beyond the third quarter, we continue to forecast strong growth across QCT, driven by new device launches, design win traction and strength in our adjacent platforms. Lastly, we launched our latest annual corporate responsibility and ESG report yesterday, which is now available on our website. 
I'm pleased to share that we have successfully met or exceeded our 2020 goals and have disclosed 2025 targets focused across key areas of diversity and inclusion, purposeful innovation and reducing our carbon footprint. We continue to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders to disclose ESG information in alignment with international standards. 
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and focused execution. I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

We're not seeing any significant inventory build in the channels. So let me just maybe clarify that to start with. If you think about QTL revenues sequentially from December quarter to March quarter, we've talked about seasonality in that business consistently in the past. And so our guidance really reflects that. So it's no different than kind of the shape of the year that you generally see in the handset market and mix of OEMs being reflected in the dollars. So in the past, we talked about $1.7 billion midpoint, going to $1.4 billion from December to March. And what we are guiding is we came in just below the midpoint in the December quarter, and we're guiding similarly just below the $1.4 billion for the March quarter. So that's the message on QTL. 
On QCT, clearly, with Apple now in our revenue stream, there's a different seasonality than we've had in the past. And so you see kind of that becoming a factor. But when you take -- remove that, our seasonality is actually extremely strong with significant growth from December to March quarter. And really strength across not just mobile platform with the launch of our Snapdragon 888 chipset but also across RFFE, auto and IoT being strong as well. So it's really strength across the board. And what you see in the numbers is the seasonality of the revenue profile showing up."

As we've said in the past, we feel like we have the ability to hold margins in the -- in the -- in -- consistent with our recent history and potential upside opportunity to grow it.

When we reported Q2 just 1 year ago, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Much has happened since then, including many things that will define our future well beyond this past year. 
One of the undeniable things we have experienced and at an accelerated pace is the importance and reliance global citizens have on robust connectivity and the need for low-power, high-performance devices. This has reinforced and amplified our mission. Sitting here in San Diego today, we are optimistic about what we see on the horizon. Yet while the pandemic impacted nearly everyone at the same time last year, the experience today is very different depending on where you are in the world. 
In particular, I want to acknowledge our employees, customers and partners in India. You and your families are in our thoughts, and we are here to support you through this very challenging time. 
Of the many things that have impressed me during my 26-year career at Qualcomm, at the top of the list is how our company mobilized in the past year, leading to strong results like we reported today. 
Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.90 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by higher licensing revenues and solid performance in our chipset business, representing non-GAAP revenue and EPS year-over-year growth of 52% and 116%, respectively. Despite the backdrop of a challenging environment, these results and our guidance reflect the strength of the company and the importance of our technologies, not only to the mobile industry, but across many industries. 
Several years ago, we put in place a strategy to lead in 5G, which today is delivering results beyond our expectations. Even this fiscal year, with all the unusual challenges, we are on track to deliver results better than what we expected when we started the fiscal year. 
As exciting as our current performance is, I cannot underestimate the long-term opportunity for Qualcomm and how well positioned the company is, where we have a unique opportunity to exceed our success in handsets as industries adopt the wireless road map. 
This enviable position is what I find most rewarding when looking back over the past 7 years. Undeniably, over my tenure as CEO, I dealt with and overcame unprecedented challenges, which I always put in perspective. Our mission and singular focus of inventing breakthrough technologies transforming how the world connects, computes and communicates is important and hard to do. Our challenges tightened our focus on this mission. And at the core, innovation was always the solution. 
As a result, Qualcomm enters the 5G era with our whole company stronger and more resilient. Most importantly, we never lost focus on the impact and opportunity digitization will bring to our customers, partners, governments and consumers worldwide as a result of our collective efforts. 
Speaking as a soon to be former CEO, I believe there is virtually no limit on where Cristiano can lead Qualcomm, the industries he can enter and the role the company can play in the global ecosystem. I am very excited to watch this play out. 
To all our employees, I thank you for your tireless devotion and commitment to our strong culture and core values. I know it is very exciting for everyone at Qualcomm to witness how our inventions change the lives of billions of people around the world as we know they will. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Cristiano."

Thanks for joining us today. The quarter-end guide reflect the great execution across the company in a very challenging environment and reinforces the significance of our technologies. Our Snapdragon premium",1084,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The quarter-end guide reflect the great execution across the company in a very challenging environment and reinforces the significance of our technologies. Our Snapdragon premium and high-tier products along with our modem-to-antenna RF front end are the foundation of our 5G handset strategy now and into the future. The expansion of our addressable market in this smartphone tiers has positioned the Snapdragon 800 tier as synonymous with Android flagship mobile experiences. 
We continue to be the mobile technology platform of choice for these tiers, and this is reflected both in our product performance as well as our traction with leading smartphone OEMs such as Samsung Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and now, Honor. 
Our latest generation Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform has now more than 40 device shipped or announced globally, and we expect to see more than double this number come to market in the coming months from future product announcements. 
Our highly differentiated position in premium and high tiers, our modem to antenna leadership and the continued transition of Huawei volume to OEMs using our solutions have positioned us to grow faster in smartphones while being able to capture the most significant portion of the revenue opportunity. 
In RF front end, we continue to see broad and growing adoption of our solutions. 5G leading performance at the component and system level, ease of design and global reach continue to be key differentiators of our modem to antenna solutions. As a reminder, virtually all of our 5G design wins continue to be powered by our RF front-end solutions, whether they support 4G, 5G sub-6 or 5G millimeter wave. Beyond smartphones, we're extending our RF front-end solutions in automotive, PCs, mobile hotspots, fixed wireless access in the broad IoT category. 
Of note, given our design win pipeline and revenue run rates, we are on track to exceed our Analyst Day RF front-end revenue target of $3.6 billion by fiscal year '22, with 5G sub-6 and 4G, representing the majority of our RF front-end revenues. 
Additionally, as 5G millimeter wave technology expands into other geographies, we expect significant expansion of our opportunity due to increased silicon content and value. 
In Mobile World Congress Shanghai in China and in collaboration with China Unicom, ZTE and the GSMA, we worked with 39 Chinese industry-leading companies to showcase the high performance enriched applications on a live 5G millimeter wave network. This level of collaboration underscores the significant attention to millimeter wave in China and the opportunity ahead, beginning in 2022. 
In automotive, we're growing across telematics, C-V2X, digital cockpit, ADAS and autonomy, and we're also well positioned for upcoming general computing in cloud-to-cloud platforms. We expect to lead in the segments as cloud-connected business models evolve in electrification of the car accelerates. As the digital chassis become one of the most important assets of automakers, we are becoming a leading technology partner for the automotive industry with capabilities across all these domains. Our automotive design win pipeline is up over $1 billion since the end of fiscal '20 to approximately $9 billion today. 
Along with auto, IoT is becoming a significant growth engine with better-than-anticipated performance across all categories, namely consumer, networking and industrial. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in revenue. Trends such as the enterprise transformation of the home, expansion of broadband, the conversions of personal computing with mobile, the intersection of physical and virtual spaces in the ongoing digital transformation across many verticals are driving growth in one of the largest SAM expansion opportunities for us. 
In consumer, as the industry redefines personnel computing, we're confident about our growth in Android, Chrome OS and Windows on Snapdragon where we expect new products with leading NUVIA CPUs by the end of the next calendar year. We're also seeing our early investments in Exor platforms reaching scale. And in the growing category of wearables, we believe Snapdragon Sound and Snapdragon Wear will become the leading technology solutions within the Android ecosystem. 
In networking, we are a leader in WiFi access points in 5G broadband. We're benefiting from the global connectivity required for remote work, school and play in the migration to WiFi 6 and MASH technologies. Our 5G fixed wireless access solutions are seeing broad adoption globally. Going forward, we also have an opportunity to expand into upcoming private 5G networks and public open RAN. 
In industrial, we have seen continued adoption of our technologies across the broad industry segments. Key growth areas to name a few include smart energy, tracking, metering, industrial handhelds, retail, automation and autonomous drones. 
As connected IoT edge devices get scale and provide access to the data and contextual information that is fueling the exponential growth projections of cloud ecosystems, we're increasingly confident in the long-term growth opportunity for our IoT business. 
Turning to our licensing business. Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our unmatched patent portfolio value. We are the global 5G IP leader with more than 130 5G license agreements signed to date, up from over 120 last quarter with all major handset manufacturers around the globe licensed. 
We continue to develop and patent the new essential innovations for future releases of 5G, which we expect to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its impact on multiple industries. We believe that our model of early research and development, consistent standards leadership, flexible licensing and global implementation support will continue to add value to our partners and stockholders for years to come. Overall, we continue to see unprecedented demand across all of our technologies and businesses as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. Despite the industry-wide semiconductor supply shortage, we're utilizing our scale and working across our entire global supply chain to maximize our ability to capture this opportunity. We expect material improvements by the end of the calendar year due to planned capacity builds and multi-sourcing initiatives. 
As one of the leading drivers of advanced semiconductor technology platforms, we're also excited to see more foundry investment in the United States, consistent with the United States government's strategic priorities. 
Finally, we're extremely proud of our collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Ingenuity, the Morris helicopter powered by Snapdragon. Snapdragon made it to Mars and helped power the first-ever autonomous flight on another planet. This is yet another example of our ingenuity. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

These results reflect ye",799,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. 
In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments, especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior quarter royalty estimates. 
In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53%, while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage. We achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM. 
RF front-end revenues increased 39% year-over-year to approximately $900 million on the strength of our product portfolio across 4G, 5G sub-6 and 5G millimeter wave. 5G millimeter wave products accounted for less than 20% of our second quarter RF front-end revenues. We expect millimeter wave deployments in other regions such as China to be a tailwind for long-term revenue growth. Automotive revenues of $240 million grew 40%, and IoT revenues of $1.1 billion grew 71% on a year-over-year basis, as we continued to see strong momentum for our differentiated product portfolio. 
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NUVIA for a purchase price of $1.4 billion before working capital and other adjustments. This acquisition provides us with a strong CPU team with industry-leading expertise in high-performance processors and SoCs. 
Lastly, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders during the quarter, consisting of $734 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases. 
Turning to our global 3G, 4G, 5G handset forecast for calendar 2021. Based on the strength in the first quarter, we have an upward bias relative to our prior estimate of high single-digit year-over-year growth. Our calendar 2021 forecast continues to include an estimate of 450 million to 550 million 5G handsets. 
Next, I'll summarize our guidance for third fiscal quarter. We now expect a stronger outlook in both QTL and QCT relative to our prior expectations, which we shared last quarter due to several positive tailwinds. We are forecasting revenues of $7.1 billion to $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.75, with year-over-year growth of 53% and 92%, respectively, at the midpoints. 
In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion, up 39% year-over-year at the midpoint, with EBT margins of 68% to 72%. Our revenue guidance midpoint is $100 million higher than our previous estimate, reflecting the positive bias in total handset shipments. 
In QCT, we estimate revenues of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion and EBT margins of 24% to 26%. At the midpoints, this represents year-over-year revenue growth of 59% and EBT dollar growth of 151%. Our stronger forecast for QCT reflects upside in IoT, design traction in handsets and RF front end and improved product mix. We are pleased with the success of our diversification strategy as we continue to extend the adoption of smartphone technologies in automotive and IoT. In the third quarter, we expect IoT revenues to increase to $1.3 billion. 
We anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to grow 3% to 4% sequentially, which includes a full quarter impact of expenses from the NUVIA acquisition and investments to enable additional sourcing for supply. Beyond third quarter, we expect growth to be driven by 5G flagship launches for the holiday season by major OEMs and strong demand across IoT and automotive. In addition, with the continued transition of Huawei handset volume to other OEMs, we estimate QCT's annual addressable handset and RF front end revenue opportunity to increase by up to $10 billion. Given our strong product portfolio, we are positioned to benefit from this opportunity starting in fiscal '22. 
Before I finish my prepared remarks, on behalf of all Qualcomm employees, I want to thank Steve for his contributions over the past 26 years and wish him the best for a well-deserved retirement as CEO. During his successful tenure as CEO, he navigated significant challenges to put the company in a strong financial and strategic position. I look forward to working with Cristiano and the rest of the Qualcomm team to build on his vision and capitalize on the opportunities in front of us.

From a third quarter perspective, We're really seeing a lot of benefits on the QCT side, both in terms of kind of improved product mix, which is helping our performance. What we're seeing there is really since we saw supply constraints and which we continue to see across a broad set of businesses, we were able to take action to optimize our product mix, both across tiers. And then also when we had reductions in orders by a large OEM handset OEM, we were able to redirect that capacity to integrated Snapdragon products with strong margin profile.

The overall supply constrain in semiconductors for us is really across all product lines. It's not unique to one thing or the other. It's not only a smartphone.

We are utilizing our scale. And with that, we have the ability to be supporting or suppliers' capacity planning. We can provide stability of demand and, in turn, get stability of capacity. 
We are -- we're one of the few companies that have the ability to do multi-sourcing at the leading node. And we have done a lot of that with our road map. All of that combined, it give us material improvement in supply by the end of '21, positioned us very well for 2022 and the full extend, I think, as Akash outlined, the $10 billion SAM expansion on Huawei. 
Now I want to go back to your question about how we think about our customers and customer product introductions. As I said before, we're very happy with the progress we're making in premium and high tier. That's a -- it's a great opportunity for Qualcomm, and it's reflecting in the product mix. 
As we still have -- right now, even as we show growth, we still have more demand to supply, give us an opportunity also to have the ability to focus on the products to give us more value to us and to our customers, both on the premium side with RF front end attach.

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the 2 key drivers for QTL in the March quarter were significantly higher-than-expected units, primarily driven by China for the total handset markets. That was the main driver. 
And then we also did see a benefit of approximately $80 million due to adjustments to prior quarter royalty estimates. That benefited our second quarter performance. So as we go from Q2 to Q3 on the QTL side, we obviously don't have that royalty estimates adjustment benefit in Q3. 
And then the second factor is really what we're assuming is a more normalized handset market going into Q3. We saw some weakness in the December quarter strengthen in the March quarter, but when you kind of abstract back from the quarter-to-quarter variances, we think it's prudent to forecast going forward on a normalized market. So that's really what's driving QTL. 
From a QCT perspective, you're right, we are assuming a 4% quarter-over-quarter decline. If you -- as you would recall, our new premium tier product launches in the March quarter. So when we go typically from March to June, there's a little bit of seasonality. Part of that is offset by really the supply framework. And so that kind of calibrates a little bit on what happens between the quarters anyways. So that's really kind of the key drivers there. 
The one thing I'll highlight is, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, for IoT, we have very strong demand going into the June quarter. We have a forecast of $1.3 billion, increasing from $1.1 billion in March. So very happy to see the diversification across the businesses."

First is just when you think about the demand profile, handsets, RFFE, IoT, automotive, really extremely strong.

So you should think of each of those as a growth vector for us and extending into kind of Q4 and then going into next year. 
Second is flagship phone launches. As I mentioned earlier in the call, they usually start in the August, September time frame going through December. And so as those launches happen, that's a favorable trend for us, not just for handsets, but for RF front end as well with or without millimeter wave. 
And then the third is really supply improvement. As Cristiano mentioned, we've been working very hard on kind of partnership with our suppliers to improve the supply profile going forward. And as he said, towards the end of the year, we expect a material improvement in supply. So that will be another vector that will drive us forward.

Maybe you could talk a little bit about the sustainability of margin expansion in QCT. And given the June quarter is likely the revenue trough quarter for the year, is that 25% margin how we should think about the floor in margins going forward?"

We're really happy with how the margin profile has played out. I mean it's a plan that we set in place and outlined at Analyst Day about 18 months ago, and we're pretty happy to be able to execute to it. Your observation is right. I mean, typically, the June quarter is a trough from a margin perspective. And really, as you look forward from here, for us, the most important thing is the revenue scale. And hence, the things we highlighted in my prepared remarks, both from an IoT growth perspective, just gives us scale that allows us to expand operating margins. 
And then finally, the Huawei SAM, as we start approaching that SAM and really leveraging the existing products and road map, both across handsets and RF front end and growing into that SAM. We already have the product portfolio to go there. So as we grow there as well, it will be accretive to operating margins.

And I want to start by maybe providing some data points and make -- emphasize some of the data we provide in the earnings script. 
We heard a lot in the past that our RF front end business, a lot of people for the most of it was because of our leadership position in millimeter wave, which we do have a leadership position in millimeter wave, but the reality is millimeter wave represent less than 20% of the revenues that we're showing in RF. The absolutely majority of it is sub-6 and 4G actually, which actually shows that we're winning not only at the system level, we're winning at the component level. Otherwise, we will not come in as the fifth supplier and be winning 4 sockets. And that is kind of really highlighting what we said. At the end of the day, you're going to have every single spectrum, whether it's existing spectrum through DSS, that goes to 5G plus the new mid-bands and the millimeter wave bands. We feel pretty good about our road map of RF front end. The factor winning designs across the board, it's testimony that our strategy is working. 
And to your specific question about, is this going to go away. We're now probably -- if you look at the beginning, when we launched 5G in 2019 in early 2019, we're now multiple product generations and we continue to win RF front end. 
So we're very confident about this business. It is a great growth story for Qualcomm. And the beauty of this, we're actually winning on technology."

When we reported Q2 just 1 year ago, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Much has happened since then, including many things that will define our future well beyond this past year.
One of the undeniable things we have experienced and at an accelerated pace is the importance and reliance global citizens have on robust connectivity and the need for low-power, high-performance devices. This has reinforced and amplified our mission. Sitting here in San Diego today, we are optimistic about what we see on the horizon. Yet while the pandemic impacted nearly everyone at the same time last year, the experience today is very different depending on where you are in the world. In particular, I want to acknowledge our employees, customers and partners in India. You and your families are in our thoughts, and we are here to support you through this very challenging time.
Of the many things that have impressed me during my 26-year career at Qualcomm, at the top of the list is how our company mobilized in the past year, leading to strong results like we reported today. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.90 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by higher licensing revenues and solid performance in our chipset business, representing non-GAAP revenue and EPS year-over-year growth of 52% and 116%, respectively. Despite the backdrop of a challenging environment, these results and our guidance reflect the strength of the company and the importance of our technologies, not only to the mobile industry, but across many industries. 
Several years ago, we put in place a strategy to lead in 5G, which today is delivering results beyond our expectations. Even this fiscal year with all the unusual challenges, we are on track to deliver results better than what we expected when we started the fiscal year. As exciting as our current performance is, I cannot underestimate the long-term opportunity for Qualcomm and how well positioned the company is, where we have a unique opportunity to exceed our success in handsets as industries adopt the wireless road map. 
This enviable position is what I find most rewarding when looking back over the past 7 years. Undeniably, over my tenure as CEO, I dealt with and overcame unprecedented challenges, which I always put in perspective. Our mission and singular focus of inventing breakthrough technologies transforming how the world connects, computes and communicates is important and hard to do. Our challenges tightened our focus on this mission, and at the core, innovation was always the solution. As a result, Qualcomm enters the 5G era with our whole company stronger and more resilient. Most importantly, we never lost focus on the impact and opportunity digitization will bring to our customers, partners, governments and consumers worldwide as a result of our collective efforts. 
Speaking as a soon to be former CEO, I believe there is virtually no limit on where Cristiano can lead Qualcomm, the industries he can enter and the role the company can play in the global ecosystem. I am very excited to watch this play out. To all our employees, I thank you for your tireless devotion and commitment to our strong culture and core values. I know it is very exciting for everyone at Qualcomm to witness how our inventions change the lives of billions of people around the world as we know they will.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Cristiano."

Thanks for joining us today. The quarter-end guide reflect the great execution across the company in a very challenging environment and reinforces the significance of our technologies. Our Snapdragon premium",1080,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The quarter-end guide reflect the great execution across the company in a very challenging environment and reinforces the significance of our technologies. Our Snapdragon premium and high-tier products, along with our modem-to-antenna RF front end, are the foundation of our 5G handset strategy now and into the future. The expansion of our addressable market in this smartphone tiers has positioned the Snapdragon 800 tier as synonymous with Android flagship mobile experiences.
We continue to be the mobile technology platform of choice for these tiers, and this is reflected both in our product performance as well as our traction with leading smartphone OEMs, such as Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and now, Honor. Our latest generation Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform has now more than 40 device shipped or announced globally, and we expect to see more than double this number come to market in the coming months from future product announcements. Our highly differentiated position in premium and high tiers, our modem-to-antenna leadership and the continued transition of Huawei volume to OEMs using our solutions have positioned us to grow faster in smartphones while being able to capture the most significant portion of the revenue opportunity.
In RF front end, we continue to see broad and growing adoption of our solutions. 5G leading performance at the component and system level, ease of design and global reach continue to be key differentiators of our modem-to-antenna solutions. As a reminder, virtually all of our 5G design wins continue to be powered by our RF front-end solutions whether they support 4G, 5G sub-6 or 5G millimeter wave.
Beyond smartphones, we're extending our RF front-end solutions in automotive, PCs, mobile hotspots, fixed wireless access in the broad IoT category. Of note, given our design win pipeline and revenue run rates, we are on track to exceed our Analyst Day RF front-end revenue target of $3.6 billion by fiscal year '22 with 5G sub-6 and 4G representing the majority of our RF front-end revenues. Additionally, as 5G millimeter wave technology expands into other geographies, we expect significant expansion of our opportunity due to increased silicon content and value.
At Mobile World Congress Shanghai in China and in collaboration with China Unicom, ZTE and the GSMA, we worked with 39 Chinese industry-leading companies to showcase the high performance and rich applications on a live 5G millimeter wave network. This level of collaboration underscores the significant attention to millimeter wave in China and the opportunity ahead beginning in 2022.
In automotive, we're growing across telematics, C-V2X, digital cockpit, ADAS and autonomy, and we're also well positioned for upcoming general computing in car-to-cloud platforms. We expect to lead in these segments as cloud-connected business models evolve and electrification of the car accelerates. As the digital chassis become one of the most important assets of automakers, we are becoming a leading technology partner for the automotive industry with capabilities across all these domains. Our automotive design win pipeline is up over $1 billion since the end of fiscal '20 to approximately $9 billion today.
Along with auto, IoT is becoming a significant growth engine with better-than-anticipated performance across all categories, namely, consumer, networking and industrial. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in revenue. Trends such as the enterprise transformation of the home, expansion of broadband, the conversions of personal computing with mobile, the intersection of physical and virtual spaces and the ongoing digital transformation across many verticals are driving growth in one of the largest SAM expansion opportunities for us.
In consumer, as the industry redefines personal computing, we're confident about our growth in Android, Chrome OS and Windows on Snapdragon where we expect new products with leading NUVIA CPUs by the end of the next calendar year. We're also seeing our early investments in XR platforms reaching scale. And in the growing category of wearables, we believe Snapdragon Sound and Snapdragon Wear will become the leading technology solutions within the Android ecosystem.
In networking, we are a leader in WiFi access points in 5G broadband. We're benefiting from the global connectivity required for remote work, school and play and the migration to WiFi 6 and mesh technologies. Our 5G fixed wireless access solutions are seeing broad adoption globally. Going forward, we also have an opportunity to expand into upcoming private 5G networks and public open RAN.
In industrial, we have seen continued adoption of our technologies across the broad industry segments. Key growth areas to name a few include smart energy, tracking, metering, industrial handhelds, retail, automation and autonomous drones. As connected IoT edge devices get scale and provide access to the data and contextual information that is fueling the exponential growth projections of cloud ecosystems, we're increasingly confident in the long-term growth opportunity for our IoT business.
Turning to our licensing business. Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our unmatched patent portfolio value. We are the global 5G IP leader with more than 130 5G license agreements signed to date, up from over 120 last quarter with all major handset manufacturers around the globe licensed. We continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G, which we expect to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its impact on multiple industries.
We believe that our model of early research and development, consistent standards leadership, flexible licensing and global implementation support will continue to add value to our partners and stockholders for years to come. Overall, we continue to see unprecedented demand across all of our technologies and businesses as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. Despite the industry-wide semiconductor supply shortage, we're utilizing our scale and working across our entire global supply chain to maximize our ability to capture this opportunity. We expect material improvements by the end of the calendar year due to planned capacity builds and multi-sourcing initiatives.
As one of the leading drivers of advanced semiconductor technology platforms, we're also excited to see more foundry investment in the United States consistent with the United States government's strategic priorities. Finally, we're extremely proud of our collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Ingenuity, the Mars helicopter powered by Snapdragon. Snapdragon made it to Mars and helped power the first-ever autonomous flight on another planet. This is yet another example of our ingenuity.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."
33493,704135933,2261728,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect ye",798,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT.
In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior quarter royalty estimates.
In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53% while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage. We achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM.
RF front-end revenues increased 39% year-over-year to approximately $900 million on the strength of our product portfolio across 4G, 5G sub-6 and 5G millimeter wave. 5G millimeter wave products accounted for less than 20% of our second quarter RF front-end revenues. We expect millimeter wave deployments in other regions, such as China, to be a tailwind for long-term revenue growth. Automotive revenues of $240 million grew 40%, and IoT revenues of $1.1 billion grew 71% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see strong momentum for our differentiated product portfolio.
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NUVIA for a purchase price of $1.4 billion before working capital and other adjustments. This acquisition provides us with a strong CPU team with industry-leading expertise in high-performance processors and SoCs. Lastly, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders during the quarter, consisting of $734 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases.
Turning to our global 3G, 4G, 5G handset forecast for calendar 2021. Based on the strength in the first quarter, we have an upward bias relative to our prior estimate of high single-digit year-over-year growth. Our calendar 2021 forecast continues to include an estimate of 450 million to 550 million 5G handsets.
Next, I'll summarize our guidance for third fiscal quarter. We now expect a stronger outlook in both QTL and QCT relative to our prior expectations, which we shared last quarter due to several positive tailwinds. We are forecasting revenues of $7.1 billion to $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.75 with year-over-year growth of 53% and 92%, respectively, at the midpoints.
In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion, up 39% year-over-year at the midpoint, with EBT margins of 68% to 72%. Our revenue guidance midpoint is $100 million higher than our previous estimate, reflecting the positive bias in total handset shipments.
In QCT, we estimate revenues of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion and EBT margins of 24% to 26%. At the midpoint, this represents year-over-year revenue growth of 59% and EBT dollar growth of 151%. Our stronger forecast for QCT reflects upside in IoT, design traction in handsets and RF front end and improved product mix.
We are pleased with the success of our diversification strategy as we continue to extend the adoption of smartphone technologies in automotive and IoT. In the third quarter, we expect IoT revenues to increase to $1.3 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to grow 3% to 4% sequentially, which includes a full quarter impact of expenses from the NUVIA acquisition and investments to enable additional sourcing for supply.
Beyond third quarter, we expect growth to be driven by 5G flagship launches for the holiday season by major OEMs and strong demand across IoT and automotive. In addition, with the continued transition of Huawei handset volume to other OEMs, we estimate QCT's annual addressable handset and RF front-end revenue opportunity to increase by up to $10 billion. Given our strong product portfolio, we are positioned to benefit from this opportunity starting in fiscal '22.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, on behalf of all Qualcomm employees, I want to thank Steve for his contributions over the past 26 years and wish him the best for a well-deserved retirement as CEO. During his successful tenure as CEO, he navigated significant challenges to put the company in a strong financial and strategic position. I look forward to working with Cristiano and the rest of the Qualcomm team to build on his vision and capitalize on the opportunities in front of us.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

The overall supply constraint in semiconductors, for us, is really across all product lines. It's not unique to one thing or the other. It's not only smartphone. Frankly, it's a good position to be in that we actually have more demand to supply across all of our business. And that's a good sign, give us confidence about the growth position.
We are utilizing our scale. And with that, we have the ability to be supporting our suppliers' capacity planning. We can provide stability of demand and in turn, get stability of capacity. We're one of the few companies that have the ability to do multi-sourcing at the leading node, and we have done a lot of that with our road map. All of that combined, it give us material improvement in supply by the end of '21, positioned us very well for 2022 and the full extent, I think as Akash outlined, the $10 billion SAM expansion on Huawei.
Now I want to go back to your question about how we think about our customers and customer product introductions. As I said before, we're very happy with the progress we're making in premium and high tier. That's a -- it's a great opportunity for Qualcomm, and it's reflecting in the product mix. As we still have right now -- even as we show growth, we still have more demand to supply, give us an opportunity also to have the ability to focus on the products to give us more value to us and to our customers both on the premium side with RF front end attach, and that's really shown in the numbers with a much improved product mix."

That was the main driver. And then we also did see a benefit of approximately $80 million due to adjustments to prior quarter royalty estimates that benefited our second quarter performance. So as we go from Q2 to Q3, on the QTL side, we obviously don't have that royalty estimates adjustment benefit in Q3. And then the second factor is really what we're assuming is a more normalized handset market going into Q3. We saw some weakness in the December quarter strength in the March quarter. But when you kind of abstract that from the quarter-to-quarter variances, we think it's prudent to forecast going forward on a normalized market. So that's really what's driving QTL.
From a QCT perspective, you're right. We are assuming a 4% quarter-over-quarter decline. If you -- as you would recall, our new premium tier product launches in the March quarter. So when we go typically from March to June, there's a little bit of seasonality. Part of that is offset by really the supply framework. And so that kind of calibrates a little bit on what happens between the quarters anyways. So that's really kind of the key drivers there. The one thing I'll highlight is, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, for IoT, we have very strong demand going into the June quarter. We have a forecast of $1.3 billion, increasing from $1.1 billion in March. So very happy to see the diversification across the businesses."

So while we're not guiding fourth quarter at this point really, let me highlight a couple of things that maybe is a framework to think about the rest of the year. First is just when you think about the demand profile, handsets, RFFE, IoT, automotive, really extremely strong. We're gaining share pretty much in all markets and very, very strong position in each of them. So you should think of each of those as a growth vector for us and extending into kind of Q4 and then going into next year. Second is flagship phone launches. As I mentioned earlier in the call, they usually start in the August, September time frame going through December. And so as those launches happen, that's a favorable trend for us not just for handsets, but for RF front end as well with or without millimeter wave.
And then the third is really supply improvement. As Cristiano mentioned, we've been working very hard on kind of partnership with our suppliers to improve the supply profile going forward. And as he said, towards the end of the year, we expect a material improvement in supply. So that will be another vector that will drive us forward. And so those maybe are 3 things that can be used to frame the QCT profile. And then from a QTL perspective, it's really consistent with our model the way we've portrayed it. As seasonality in the handset market changes, that changes the revenue opportunity for QTL as well."

We've heard a lot in the past that our RF front end business, a lot of people for the most of it was because of our leadership position in millimeter wave, which we do have a leadership position in millimeter wave. But the reality is millimeter wave represent less than 20% of the revenues that we're showing in RF front end. The absolute majority of it is sub-6 and 4G actually, which actually shows that we're winning not only at the system level, we're winning at the component level. Otherwise, we will not come in as the fifth supplier and be winning 4G sockets.
And that is kind of really highlighting what we said. At the end of the day, you're going to have every single spectrum, whether it's existing spectrum through DSS that goes to 5G, plus the new mid-bands and the millimeter wave bands.

Thanks for joining us today. This is an amazing time to be part of Qualcomm. The need for our technologies and products has never been more evident.

The need for our technologies and products has never been more evident. We are seeing demand across virtually every industry because our products and technologies are essential ingredients that enable digital transformation in the cloud economy. We are leading and expect to continue to lead in mobile. 
In addition, we also expect to lead the evolution of the connected intelligent EDGE by transforming connectivity and processing in cars, the enterprise, the home smart factories, next-generation PCs and tablets, XR wearables and many more. This is the foundation of our revenue diversification strategy. 
The strong performance in our business has led to fiscal third quarter revenues and earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Most importantly, we are on track to realize approximately $10 billion in combined revenues across IoT, RF front end and automotive in fiscal year '21, validating the positive financial impact of our revenue diversification strategy. 
Let me provide you now with some additional details. The foundation of our IoT strategy is EDGE connectivity and processing for the growing cloud-based economy. In consumer, we're seeing strong demand driven by a consumer electronics upgrade cycle and growth in emerging product categories such as XR and wearables. 
In EDGE networking, we had another great quarter with continued momentum driven by the enterprise transformation of the home and the second wave of enterprise demand driven by return to the workplace. We're also seeing rapid adoption of WiFi 6 and increased demand for both 4G and 5G mobile broadband devices. 
In industrial, our product offerings are purpose-built for key verticals, such as transportation and logistics, warehousing, video collaboration, smart cameras, retail and more. We are at the forefront of enabling this new ecosystem and also making 5G for industrial applications a reality. 
We are becoming the connected intelligent EDGE partner of choice. As demand for automotive solutions increase, we're pleased to report that our automotive revenue design win pipeline has reached approximately $10 billion. And based on our third quarter results, our annualized automotive revenue run rate is now over $1 billion. This reflects continued traction across global automakers and Tier 1 customers. 
Our automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and CV2X solutions or at the intersection of key automotive industry trends such as the continued growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. As the digital chassis becomes one of the most important assets of automakers, we remain well positioned for continued growth as a leading technology partner for the industry. 
In RF front-end, we believe we are on track to become the largest smartphone RF front-end supplier by revenue. Looking forward, we expect to have technology leadership across virtually all handset RF front-end components while continue to lead in modem to antenna system performance. Now I will provide an update on 2 key drivers for our handset revenues. 
First, we continue to be positively impacted by the growth in 5G and changing OEM landscape, resulting in the expansion of our addressable handset opportunity. Our Snapdragon 8 Series mobile platforms have shown a significant design win momentum. More than half of our 5G smartphone design wins to date are using our 8 series in total design wins for Snapdragon 888 increased more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. 
We're also seeing strong traction with our Snapdragon 7 Series mobile platforms with nearly 40 new devices shipped or announced during this last quarter alone. Based on our design win traction and performance of our customers, we have increased confidence in growing our handset revenues. Snapdragon premium and high-tier solutions remains synonymous with Android flagship mobile experiences. 
Second, we're still on track to materially improve supply by the end of the calendar year. We're securing incremental capacity across both leading and mature nodes and optimizing the allocation of our products across the global supply chain. We're also making progress with our multi-sourcing initiatives. In fiscal Q3, the Snapdragon 778G, the first of several products from our multi-sourcing initiatives was commercialized in record time and is now shipping in volume. Additional products from our multi-sourcing initiatives will be commercialized in the coming months. 
I would like to thank our employees, our suppliers and our customers for helping us navigate the challenging supply environment. In our licensing business, our third quarter results reflect the strength of our patent portfolio and the stability of our licensing program. We are a global 5G IP leader with more than 150 5G license agreements signed to date, up from more than [ 130 ] last quarter. 
We continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G and and we expect 5G to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its broad application across multiple industries. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

Our th",703,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another exceptional quarter in a challenging environment as we continue to execute on our priorities including 5G adoption, revenue diversification and operating leverage. Our third quarter results were above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP revenues of $8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92.  
These results reflect 63% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP revenues and more than doubling of EPS, driven by strength across QCT and QTL including a partial recovery from the impact of COVID in the year ago period. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margins of 71% were above the midpoint of our guidance. These results reflect the impact of a stronger mix offset by lower-than-expected units in China and India. 
QCT revenues of $6.5 billion and EBT margins of 28% were above the high end of our guidance. EBT of $1.8 billion nearly tripled versus the year ago period on revenue growth of 70% and 12 points of EBIT margin expansion. Handset revenues increased 57% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, driven by the adoption of 5G products in premium and high-tier devices across all major OEMs. 
Combined, RF front-end, IoT and automotive revenues accounted for approximately 40% of total QCT revenues within the quarter and grew 1.6x faster than handset revenues year-over-year. RF front-end revenues of $957 million more than doubled year-over-year on the strength of our broad product portfolio and customer traction. 
As a reminder, our RF front-end revenues include power amplifiers, trackers, antenna tuners, filters, diversity and millimeter-wave modules and excludes revenue from RF transceivers. IoT revenues grew 83% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million versus guidance. The outperformance was driven by demand across consumer edge networking and industrial platforms. Automotive revenues of $253 million grew 83% year-over-year on the adoption of connected cars and expansion of digital cockpit revenues. Our increasing design win pipeline now puts us on track to exceed the 2024 revenue target outlined at last Investor Day. 
Turning to our guidance for handset units and fourth fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we're maintaining our forecast for high single-digit growth for global 3G, 4G, 5G handsets, including 450 million to 550 million 5G handsets. Given the strong adoption of 5G in developed regions in China, we have a bias towards the high end of our 5G forecast. 
In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.4 billion to $9.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margins of 29% to 31%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 46% and EBT dollar growth of 114%. 
The strength of our QCT forecast reflects sequential growth across all revenue streams, including premium and high-tier device launches and operating leverage benefit from extending our mobile technology and investments across IoT and automotive. Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to grow 2% to 3% sequentially. Based on the midpoints of our fourth quarter guidance, I would like to emphasize some key metrics for fiscal 2021. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $8.24 nearly doubling relative to fiscal 2020. Within QCT, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of $10 billion and operating margin expansion from 17% in fiscal '20 to 28% in fiscal '21. With our continued focus on diversification, we are forecasting RF front-end IoT and automotive combined revenues to grow from $6 billion in fiscal '20 to $10 billion in fiscal '21. We expect to exit the fiscal year with a strong product road map, expanded design win pipeline and increased customer traction. 
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I'd like to highlight a couple of items. As part of our ongoing ESG efforts, we recently started purchasing 100% renewable solar energy for our San Diego headquarters, which will significantly reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly, we'll be hosting our Investor Day in New York on November 16, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and financial outlook. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

Really, when you look at our operating leverage performance in the year, we're pretty happy with the way we've seen the operating margin expansion with revenue growth. If you look at what happened in the third quarter, we had a guidance midpoint of 25%. We came in at 28%. And so that's on the strength largely of revenue coming in higher and then strong gross margin performance as well. And then now we are forecasting a midpoint of 30% in the fourth fiscal quarter. So really, when you think about it, going forward, we plan our margins around revenue scale and R&D investments. And the trick really for us is to optimize those 2. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, as we exit the fiscal year, we feel like we're in a very strong position from a design win perspective to continue to grow revenues. And as we optimize investments against it, I think we have an opportunity to continue to expand our operating margins."

So stay tuned for more, but we're very happy about what we see with IoT right now."

For the third fiscal quarter, as you know, our guidance midpoint was $1.65, we came in at $1.92. And really, most of the upside was driven by QCT. We did come in a slightly stronger in QTL, which was really just a trade-off between slightly lower units on in India and China at the low tier, but offset by stronger product mix, especially with 5G in various regions, so that helped us. Going over to QCT, what we really liked about the growth that we saw in the quarter is really we saw strength across all the different revenue streams. So it's not just handsets, but also IoT and RF front-end and auto. And within that, we had a stronger mix -- product mix that helped us. And as we just discussed on the IoT side, significant upside, $100 million higher than the revenue guidance we had given. So that helped as well. And then maybe the last thing I'll highlight is the gross margin performance. We're pretty happy with the gross point in performance in the quarter. So those were kind of all the key factors that contributed to it. 
Turning over to supply. As we said in Cristiano's prepared remarks, consistent with what we provided last time, we continue to expect that supply will improve materially by the end of the year. And it's really a combination of 2 drivers. We're seeing multi-sourcing initiatives that we put in place over the last several months, we are seeing the benefit of that as we can use available capacity across the foundries. And then the second is really previously planned capacity builds with some of our suppliers that comes online towards the end of the year as well. So both of those initiatives that we have previously discussed are in play, and that's helping us. The first one of our multisourcing product, we recently commercialized and we have a couple more coming up. So that's really our seeing some of the benefits of those initiatives in our September quarter guide, and we'll see even more benefit in the December quarter guide."

There's always going to be a place Qualcomm in this business. The second part of the answer, which I think is the most important and an opportunity to address investor concerns is the biggest opportunity for Qualcomm in mobile is the changes that are happening in the mobile landscape right now. As a matter of fact, this quarter, Xiaomi is now the #2 OEM in award and shipments. And we see the shift in OEM market share create an incredible opportunity for us. Snapdragon became synonymous with Android premium and high tier. That is how we're going to go faster than the market and incredible opportunity for revenue and earnings, looking at the whole value of the Snapdragon platform.

In addition to that, as you're seeing the changing OEM landscape is benefiting us with our customers winning share. And as that happens, when you combine that with our product portfolio within 5G and design commitments, from our customers, especially in the premium and high tiers that positions us to grow significantly as we move into fiscal '22.

So that -- it's a clear indication about Qualcomm opportunity in the premium and high and where we can capture the majority of the value of the market.

Within handsets, obviously, we're getting the benefit from launch of new handsets that happened during that time, especially in the premium and high tier and then some supply improvements coming into the picture as well. The 1 thing to keep in mind, as a reminder, last year, we had a higher-than-normal sequential increase from September to December quarter. And that was obviously because of 2 reasons that we would not have this time First is Apple coming back as a customer to Qualcomm. And so that exaggerated the seasonality.

When you break down the business, and we broke it down in the slide you're referring to in 3 buckets. We had edge networking, consumer and industrial. Neither of those are dominant categories. So you should think of all 3 as contributing very materially to the total amount of revenue. Maybe I'll highlight a couple of things. Within EDGE networking, both the WiFi access point business and the 5G fixed wireless business, they're both very strong for us. And especially when you think about the 5G fixed wireless business, we're really at the very front end of that having a very material impact for us. So we're looking forward to the growth that, that offers to us over the next several years. In the consumer business, clearly, there is a very broad set of products we have. The revenue is split between several products. But then also as you look forward, the opportunity within the next-generation PCs and AR are very material things that could be material growth drivers going forward. And then within industrial, that's a very broad field, and we're really not even in the first innings on that market.

And then second is focusing on diversification outside. And so that adds scale to the margin profile. The next point I'd maybe highlight is a lot of the technology that funds, the growth in IoT and auto is coming from mobile. So mobile technology is being reused in these areas in very large scale. And that allows us to really get the operating leverage benefit that we were planning for. And then, of course, we are balancing that with R&D investments and making sure we're investing in the right things that position us to continue to win in these exciting areas in the long term. So it's a combination of those factors."

So those are reasonable data points to project forward to get to an annual number for the licensing business. There are a few things that could drive upside on top of that. But again, we think of it as upside opportunities. The growth outside handsets is a factor. Second is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're seeing a mix shift that's very positive for us. And so as mix shift continues, we'll see the benefit in QCT, but we'll also see the benefit. And so that would be another upside driver. And especially with 5G penetrating the lower tiers, that will be a factor for QTL as well. And again, it will show up through better ASPs and as a result, better revenues.

The need for our technologies and products has never been more evident. We are seeing demand across virtually every industry because our products and technologies are essential ingredients that enable digital transformation in the cloud economy. We are leading and expect to continue to lead in mobile. In addition, we also expect to lead the evolution of the connected intelligent EDGE by transforming connectivity and processing in cars, the enterprise, the home, smart factories, next-generation PCs and tablets, XR, wearables and many more. This is the foundation of our revenue diversification strategy.  
The strong performance in our business has led to fiscal third quarter revenues and earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Most importantly, we are on track to realize approximately $10 billion in combined revenues across IoT, RF front-end and automotive in fiscal year '21, validating the positive financial impact of our revenue diversification strategy.
Let me provide you now with some additional details. The foundation of our IoT strategy is EDGE connectivity and processing for the growing cloud-based economy. In consumer, we're seeing strong demand driven by a consumer electronics upgrade cycle and growth in emerging product categories such as XR and wearables.
In EDGE networking, we had another great quarter with continued momentum driven by the enterprise transformation of the home and the second wave of enterprise demand driven by return to the workplace. We're also seeing rapid adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and increased demand for both 4G and 5G mobile broadband devices. In industrial, our product offerings are purpose-built for key verticals, such as transportation and logistics, warehousing, video collaboration, smart cameras, retail and more. We are at the forefront of enabling this new ecosystem and also making 5G for industrial applications a reality. We are becoming the connected intelligent EDGE partner of choice. 
As demand for automotive solutions increase, we're pleased to report that our automotive revenue design win pipeline has reached approximately $10 billion. And based on our third quarter results, our annualized automotive revenue run rate is now over $1 billion. This reflects continued traction across global automakers and Tier 1 customers. Our automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are at the intersection of key automotive industry trends such as the continued growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. As the digital chassis becomes one of the most important assets of automakers, we remain well positioned for continued growth as a leading technology partner for the industry.  
In RF front-end, we believe we are on track to become the largest smartphone RF front-end supplier by revenue. Looking forward, we expect to have technology leadership across virtually all handset RF front-end components while continue to lead in modem to antenna system performance.
Now I will provide an update on 2 key drivers for our handset revenues. First, we continue to be positively impacted by the growth in 5G and changing OEM landscape, resulting in the expansion of our addressable handset opportunity. Our Snapdragon 8 series mobile platforms have shown significant design win momentum. More than half of our 5G smartphone design wins to date are using our 8 series and total design wins for Snapdragon 888 increased more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. 
We're also seeing strong traction with our Snapdragon 7 series mobile platforms with nearly 40 new devices shipped or announced during this last quarter alone. Based on our design win traction and performance of our customers, we have increased confidence in growing our handset revenues. Snapdragon premium and high-tier solutions remains synonymous with Android flagship mobile experiences.
Second, we're still on track to materially improve supply by the end of the calendar year. We're securing incremental capacity across both leading and mature nodes and optimizing the allocation of our products across the global supply chain. We're also making progress with our multi-sourcing initiatives. In fiscal Q3, the Snapdragon 778G, the first of several products from our multi-sourcing initiatives was commercialized in record time and is now shipping in volume. Additional products from our multi-sourcing initiatives will be commercialized in the coming months. I would like to thank our employees, our suppliers and our customers for helping us navigate the challenging supply environment. 
In our licensing business, our third quarter results reflect the strength of our patent portfolio and the stability of our licensing program. We are a global 5G IP leader with more than 150 5G license agreements signed to date, up from more than 130 last quarter. We continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G and we expect 5G to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its broad application across multiple industries.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

Our th",703,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another exceptional quarter in a challenging environment as we continue to execute on our priorities including 5G adoption, revenue diversification and operating leverage. Our third quarter results were above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP revenues of $8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92. These results reflect 63% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP revenues and more than doubling of EPS, driven by strength across QCT and QTL including a partial recovery from the impact of COVID in the year ago period.
QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margins of 71% were above the midpoint of our guidance. These results reflect the impact of a stronger mix offset by lower-than-expected units in China and India. QCT revenues of $6.5 billion and EBT margins of 28% were above the high end of our guidance. EBT of $1.8 billion nearly tripled versus the year ago period on revenue growth of 70% and 12 points of EBT margin expansion. Handset revenues increased 57% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, driven by the adoption of 5G products in premium and high-tier devices across all major OEMs. Combined, RF front-end, IoT and automotive revenues accounted for approximately 40% of total QCT revenues within the quarter and grew 1.6x faster than handset revenues year-over-year.
RF front-end revenues of $957 million more than doubled year-over-year on the strength of our broad product portfolio and customer traction. As a reminder, our RF front-end revenues include power amplifiers, trackers, antenna tuners, filters, diversity and millimeter-wave modules and excludes revenue from RF transceivers. IoT revenues grew 83% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million versus guidance. The outperformance was driven by demand across consumer EDGE networking and industrial platforms. Automotive revenues of $253 million grew 83% year-over-year on the adoption of connected cars and expansion of digital cockpit revenues. Our increasing design win pipeline now puts us on track to exceed the 2024 revenue target outlined at the last Investor Day.  
Turning to our guidance for handset units and fourth fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we're maintaining our forecast for high single-digit growth for global 3G, 4G, 5G handsets, including 450 million to 550 million 5G handsets. Given the strong adoption of 5G in developed regions in China, we have a bias towards the high end of our 5G forecast. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.4 billion to $9.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margins of 29% to 31%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 46% and EBT dollar growth of 114%.
The strength of our QCT forecast reflects sequential growth across all revenue streams, including premium and high-tier device launches and operating leverage benefit from extending our mobile technology and investments across IoT and automotive. Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to grow 2% to 3% sequentially. 
Based on the midpoints of our fourth quarter guidance, I would like to emphasize some key metrics for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $8.24, nearly doubling relative to fiscal 2020. Within QCT, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of $10 billion and operating margin expansion from 17% in fiscal '20 to 28% in fiscal '21. With our continued focus on diversification, we are forecasting RF front-end, IoT and automotive combined revenues to grow from $6 billion in fiscal '20 to $10 billion in fiscal '21. We expect to exit the fiscal year with a strong product road map, expanded design win pipeline and increased customer traction.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I'd like to highlight a couple items. As part of our ongoing ESG efforts, we recently started purchasing 100% renewable solar energy for our San Diego headquarters, which will significantly reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly, we'll be hosting our Investor Day in New York on November 16, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and financial outlook.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

Really, when you look at our operating leverage performance in the year, we're pretty happy with the way we've seen the operating margin expansion with revenue growth. If you look at what happened in the third quarter, we had a guidance midpoint of 25%. We came in at 28%. And so that's on the strength largely of revenue coming in higher and then strong gross margin performance as well. And then now we are forecasting a midpoint of 30% in the fourth fiscal quarter.
So really, when you think about it, going forward, we plan our margins around revenue scale and R&D investments. And the trick really for us is to optimize those 2. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, as we exit the fiscal year, we feel like we're in a very strong position from a design win perspective to continue to grow revenues. And as we optimize investments against it, I think we have an opportunity to continue to expand our operating margins."

For the third fiscal quarter, as you know, our guidance midpoint was $1.65. We came in at $1.92. And really, most of the upside was driven by QCT. We did come in slightly stronger on QTL, which was really just a trade-off between slightly lower units in India and China, the low tiers, but offset by stronger product mix, especially with 5G in various regions, so that helped us.
Going over to QCT, what we really liked about the growth that we saw in the quarter is really we saw strength across all the different revenue streams. So it's not just handsets, but also IoT and RF front-end and auto. And within that, we had a stronger mix -- product mix that helped us. And as we just discussed on the IoT side, significant upside, $100 million higher than the revenue guidance we had given. So that helped as well.
And then maybe the last thing I'll highlight is the gross margin performance. We're pretty happy with the gross point in performance in the quarter. So those were kind of all the key factors that contributed to it.
Turning over to supply. As we said in Cristiano's prepared remarks, consistent with what we provided last time, we continue to expect that supply will improve materially by the end of the year. And it's really a combination of 2 drivers. We're seeing multi-sourcing initiatives that we put in place over the last several months. We are seeing the benefit of that as we can use available capacity across the foundries. And then the second is really previously planned capacity builds with some of our suppliers that comes online towards the end of the year as well. So both of those initiatives that we have previously discussed are in play, and that's helping us.
The first one of our multisourcing product, we recently commercialized and we have a couple more coming up. So that's really -- your seeing some of the benefits of those initiatives in our September quarter guide, and we'll see even more benefit in the December quarter guide."

At the end of the day, you should always think of Qualcomm, we have always been really focused on cellular technology, the first with every new generation of wireless and as long as modem continue to be relevant, there's always going to be a place for Qualcomm in this business.
The second part of the answer, which I think is the most important and an opportunity to address investor concerns is the biggest opportunity for Qualcomm in mobile is the changes that are happening in the mobile landscape right now. As a matter of fact, this quarter, Xiaomi is now the #2 OEM in award and shipments. And we see this shift in OEM market share create an incredible opportunity for us. Snapdragon became synonymous with Android premium and high tier. That is how we're going to go faster than the market and incredible opportunity for revenue and earnings, looking at the whole value of the Snapdragon platform. We're super focused on executing on this opportunity, and it's going to be one of the key drivers of growth in Qualcomm handset strategy going forward."

And as that happens, we still think the metric that we gave previously of a 1.5x multiplier on our revenue and margin opportunity still holds.
In addition to that, as you're seeing the changing OEM landscape is benefiting us with our customers winning share. And as that happens, when you combine that with our product portfolio within 5G and design commitments, from our customers, especially in the premium and high tiers that positions us to grow significantly as we move into fiscal '22. Maybe a quick data point to give on Honor. They are in the process of launching 3 phones with us. One is a premium tier Snapdragon 888 phone and then 2 in the high tier.

Not only we have a strong road map, but we have customer commitments to premium and high-tier designs for Qualcomm. The total design wins for Snapdragon 800 increased 20% quarter-over-quarter, and of our total 5G design wins 1/2 of the design is Snapdragon 8 series.
So that in -- it's a clear indication about Qualcomm opportunity in the premium and high where we can capture the majority of the value of the market. And we look at the growth of handset segment, I know we talked a lot about the growth outside handset, but handsets up $6 billion year-over-year. Q3 '21 handset revenue up 57%.

Within handsets, obviously, we're getting the benefit from the launch of new handsets that happened during that time, especially in the premium and high tier and then some supply improvements coming into the picture as well. The one thing to keep in mind, as a reminder, last year, we had a higher-than-normal sequential increase from September to December quarter. And that was obviously because of 2 reasons that we would not have this time. First is Apple coming back as a customer to Qualcomm. And so that exaggerated the seasonality. And then also there was a delay in their phone launch. So those are key factors if you compare to last year that would not be factors that would imply this year."

If you look at what happened in our IoT business this year, we were somewhere in the $1.1 billion range, revenue range for March. We grew to $1.4 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we feel like we're in a strong position to continue to grow that revenue stream. So pretty interesting trends for us. When you break down the business, and we broke it down in the slide you are referring to in 3 buckets. We had EDGE networking, consumer and industrial. Neither of those are dominant categories. So you should think of all 3 as contributing very materially to the total amount of revenue.
Maybe I'll highlight a couple of things. Within EDGE networking, both the Wi-Fi access point business and the 5G fixed wireless business, they're both very strong for us. And especially when you think about the 5G fixed wireless business, we're really at the very front end of that having a very material impact for us. So we're looking forward to the growth that, that offers to us over the next several years. In the consumer business, clearly, there is a very broad set of products we have. The revenue is split between several products. But then also as you look forward, the opportunity within the next-generation PCs and AR VR are very material things that could be -- material growth drivers going forward.
And then within industrial, that's a very broad field, and we're really not even in the first innings on that market. So a long ways to go for us and we're excited all these markets are looking for technologies from us."

I think we're highly differentiated in that space, and it's really showing based on our design wins.
Also, we're starting to see digital cockpit becoming more material in the revenue, which is really a much richer silicon opportunity for us as we look at the dashboard, the infotainment, rear seat entertainment, heads-up display, smart mirrors, smart side view mirrors and so forth. And there is a complete redesign of the in-car experience. I will argue today, Qualcomm is now winning the absolute majority of premium tier car RFPs. We are engaged with 23 of the 26 brands. Highly differentiated in the space also because we can take a system approach connecting all those different systems together. You should start thinking about our automotive business as there are going to be a digital chassis, then an automotive company will have to build and we are differentiated because we have capabilities across multiple domains, and it's starting to reflect in the magnitude of our contracted pipeline."

And then second is focusing on diversification outside. And so that adds scale to the margin profile.
The next point I'd maybe highlight is a lot of the technology that funds the growth in IoT and auto is coming from mobile. So mobile technology is being reused in these areas in very large scale. And that allows us to really get the operating leverage benefit that we were planning for. And then, of course, we are balancing that with R&D investments and making sure we're investing in the right things that position us to continue to win in these exciting areas in the long term.

So those are reasonable data points to project forward to get to an annual number for the licensing business.
There are a few things that could drive upside on top of that. But again, we think of it as upside opportunities. The growth outside handsets is a factor. Second is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're seeing a mix shift that's very positive for us. And so as mix shift continues, we'll see the benefit in QCT, but we'll also see the benefit in QTL. And so that would be another upside driver. And especially with 5G penetrating the lower tiers, that will be a factor for QTL as well. And again, it will show up through better ASPs and as a result, better revenues.

The need for our technologies and products has never been more evident. We are seeing demand across virtually every industry because our products and technologies are essential ingredients that enable digital transformation in the cloud economy. We are leading and expect to continue to lead in mobile. In addition, we also expect to lead the evolution of the connected intelligent EDGE by transforming connectivity and processing in cars, the enterprise, the home, smart factories, next-generation PCs and tablets, XR, wearables and many more. This is the foundation of our revenue diversification strategy.  
The strong performance in our business has led to fiscal third quarter revenues and earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Most importantly, we are on track to realize approximately $10 billion in combined revenues across IoT, RF front-end and automotive in fiscal year '21, validating the positive financial impact of our revenue diversification strategy.
Let me provide you now with some additional details. The foundation of our IoT strategy is EDGE connectivity and processing for the growing cloud-based economy. In consumer, we're seeing strong demand driven by a consumer electronics upgrade cycle and growth in emerging product categories such as XR and wearables.
In EDGE networking, we had another great quarter with continued momentum driven by the enterprise transformation of the home and the second wave of enterprise demand driven by return to the workplace. We're also seeing rapid adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and increased demand for both 4G and 5G mobile broadband devices. In industrial, our product offerings are purpose-built for key verticals, such as transportation and logistics, warehousing, video collaboration, smart cameras, retail and more. We are at the forefront of enabling this new ecosystem and also making 5G for industrial applications a reality. We are becoming the connected intelligent EDGE partner of choice. 
As demand for automotive solutions increase, we're pleased to report that our automotive revenue design win pipeline has reached approximately $10 billion. And based on our third quarter results, our annualized automotive revenue run rate is now over $1 billion. This reflects continued traction across global automakers and Tier 1 customers. Our automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are at the intersection of key automotive industry trends such as the continued growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. As the digital chassis becomes one of the most important assets of automakers, we remain well positioned for continued growth as a leading technology partner for the industry.  
In RF front-end, we believe we are on track to become the largest smartphone RF front-end supplier by revenue. Looking forward, we expect to have technology leadership across virtually all handset RF front-end components while continue to lead in modem to antenna system performance.
Now I will provide an update on 2 key drivers for our handset revenues. First, we continue to be positively impacted by the growth in 5G and changing OEM landscape, resulting in the expansion of our addressable handset opportunity. Our Snapdragon 8 series mobile platforms have shown significant design win momentum. More than half of our 5G smartphone design wins to date are using our 8 series and total design wins for Snapdragon 888 increased more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. 
We're also seeing strong traction with our Snapdragon 7 series mobile platforms with nearly 40 new devices shipped or announced during this last quarter alone. Based on our design win traction and performance of our customers, we have increased confidence in growing our handset revenues. Snapdragon premium and high-tier solutions remains synonymous with Android flagship mobile experiences.
Second, we're still on track to materially improve supply by the end of the calendar year. We're securing incremental capacity across both leading and mature nodes and optimizing the allocation of our products across the global supply chain. We're also making progress with our multi-sourcing initiatives. In fiscal Q3, the Snapdragon 778G, the first of several products from our multi-sourcing initiatives was commercialized in record time and is now shipping in volume. Additional products from our multi-sourcing initiatives will be commercialized in the coming months. I would like to thank our employees, our suppliers and our customers for helping us navigate the challenging supply environment. 
In our licensing business, our third quarter results reflect the strength of our patent portfolio and the stability of our licensing program. We are a global 5G IP leader with more than 150 5G license agreements signed to date, up from more than 130 last quarter. We continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G and we expect 5G to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its broad application across multiple industries.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

We are pleased to report another exceptional quarter in a challenging environment as we continue to execute on our priorities including 5G adoption, revenue diversification and operating leverage. Our th",703,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another exceptional quarter in a challenging environment as we continue to execute on our priorities including 5G adoption, revenue diversification and operating leverage. Our third quarter results were above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP revenues of $8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92. These results reflect 63% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP revenues and more than doubling of EPS, driven by strength across QCT and QTL including a partial recovery from the impact of COVID in the year ago period.
QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margins of 71% were above the midpoint of our guidance. These results reflect the impact of a stronger mix offset by lower-than-expected units in China and India. QCT revenues of $6.5 billion and EBT margins of 28% were above the high end of our guidance. EBT of $1.8 billion nearly tripled versus the year ago period on revenue growth of 70% and 12 points of EBT margin expansion. Handset revenues increased 57% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, driven by the adoption of 5G products in premium and high-tier devices across all major OEMs. Combined, RF front-end, IoT and automotive revenues accounted for approximately 40% of total QCT revenues within the quarter and grew 1.6x faster than handset revenues year-over-year.
RF front-end revenues of $957 million more than doubled year-over-year on the strength of our broad product portfolio and customer traction. As a reminder, our RF front-end revenues include power amplifiers, trackers, antenna tuners, filters, diversity and millimeter-wave modules and excludes revenue from RF transceivers. IoT revenues grew 83% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million versus guidance. The outperformance was driven by demand across consumer EDGE networking and industrial platforms. Automotive revenues of $253 million grew 83% year-over-year on the adoption of connected cars and expansion of digital cockpit revenues. Our increasing design win pipeline now puts us on track to exceed the 2024 revenue target outlined at the last Investor Day.  
Turning to our guidance for handset units and fourth fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we're maintaining our forecast for high single-digit growth for global 3G, 4G, 5G handsets, including 450 million to 550 million 5G handsets. Given the strong adoption of 5G in developed regions in China, we have a bias towards the high end of our 5G forecast. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.4 billion to $9.2 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margins of 29% to 31%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 46% and EBT dollar growth of 114%.
The strength of our QCT forecast reflects sequential growth across all revenue streams, including premium and high-tier device launches and operating leverage benefit from extending our mobile technology and investments across IoT and automotive. Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to grow 2% to 3% sequentially. 
Based on the midpoints of our fourth quarter guidance, I would like to emphasize some key metrics for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $8.24, nearly doubling relative to fiscal 2020. Within QCT, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of $10 billion and operating margin expansion from 17% in fiscal '20 to 28% in fiscal '21. With our continued focus on diversification, we are forecasting RF front-end, IoT and automotive combined revenues to grow from $6 billion in fiscal '20 to $10 billion in fiscal '21. We expect to exit the fiscal year with a strong product road map, expanded design win pipeline and increased customer traction.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I'd like to highlight a couple items. As part of our ongoing ESG efforts, we recently started purchasing 100% renewable solar energy for our San Diego headquarters, which will significantly reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly, we'll be hosting our Investor Day in New York on November 16, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and financial outlook.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

Really, when you look at our operating leverage performance in the year, we're pretty happy with the way we've seen the operating margin expansion with revenue growth. If you look at what happened in the third quarter, we had a guidance midpoint of 25%. We came in at 28%. And so that's on the strength largely of revenue coming in higher and then strong gross margin performance as well. And then now we are forecasting a midpoint of 30% in the fourth fiscal quarter.
So really, when you think about it, going forward, we plan our margins around revenue scale and R&D investments. And the trick really for us is to optimize those 2. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, as we exit the fiscal year, we feel like we're in a very strong position from a design win perspective to continue to grow revenues. And as we optimize investments against it, I think we have an opportunity to continue to expand our operating margins."

For the third fiscal quarter, as you know, our guidance midpoint was $1.65. We came in at $1.92. And really, most of the upside was driven by QCT. We did come in slightly stronger on QTL, which was really just a trade-off between slightly lower units in India and China, the low tiers, but offset by stronger product mix, especially with 5G in various regions, so that helped us.
Going over to QCT, what we really liked about the growth that we saw in the quarter is really we saw strength across all the different revenue streams. So it's not just handsets, but also IoT and RF front-end and auto. And within that, we had a stronger mix -- product mix that helped us. And as we just discussed on the IoT side, significant upside, $100 million higher than the revenue guidance we had given. So that helped as well.
And then maybe the last thing I'll highlight is the gross margin performance. We're pretty happy with the gross point in performance in the quarter. So those were kind of all the key factors that contributed to it.
Turning over to supply. As we said in Cristiano's prepared remarks, consistent with what we provided last time, we continue to expect that supply will improve materially by the end of the year. And it's really a combination of 2 drivers. We're seeing multi-sourcing initiatives that we put in place over the last several months. We are seeing the benefit of that as we can use available capacity across the foundries. And then the second is really previously planned capacity builds with some of our suppliers that comes online towards the end of the year as well. So both of those initiatives that we have previously discussed are in play, and that's helping us.
The first one of our multisourcing product, we recently commercialized and we have a couple more coming up. So that's really -- your seeing some of the benefits of those initiatives in our September quarter guide, and we'll see even more benefit in the December quarter guide."

The second part of the answer, which I think is the most important and an opportunity to address investor concerns is the biggest opportunity for Qualcomm in mobile is the changes that are happening in the mobile landscape right now. As a matter of fact, this quarter, Xiaomi is now the #2 OEM in award and shipments. And we see this shift in OEM market share create an incredible opportunity for us. Snapdragon became synonymous with Android premium and high tier. That is how we're going to go faster than the market and incredible opportunity for revenue and earnings, looking at the whole value of the Snapdragon platform.

What is really important for Qualcomm and I'll give a couple of metrics. One, outlined by Akash. Not only we have a strong road map, but we have customer commitments to premium and high-tier designs for Qualcomm. The total design wins for Snapdragon 800 increased 20% quarter-over-quarter, and of our total 5G design wins 1/2 of the design is Snapdragon 8 series.
So that in -- it's a clear indication about Qualcomm opportunity in the premium and high where we can capture the majority of the value of the market. And we look at the growth of handset segment, I know we talked a lot about the growth outside handset, but handsets up $6 billion year-over-year. Q3 '21 handset revenue up 57%. So that's a clear indication that we are in a good position. We see this as one of the largest growth opportunities we have for the handset business, and we'll continue to be executing into this new TAM with premium and high-tier devices."

On the QCT side, we expect the seasonality to be a favorable thing for all of our businesses, so not just handsets, but RF front-end, IoT and auto. And so we'll see a typical seasonal benefit.
Within handsets, obviously, we're getting the benefit from the launch of new handsets that happened during that time, especially in the premium and high tier and then some supply improvements coming into the picture as well. The one thing to keep in mind, as a reminder, last year, we had a higher-than-normal sequential increase from September to December quarter. And that was obviously because of 2 reasons that we would not have this time. First is Apple coming back as a customer to Qualcomm. And so that exaggerated the seasonality. And then also there was a delay in their phone launch. So those are key factors if you compare to last year that would not be factors that would imply this year."

When you break down the business, and we broke it down in the slide you are referring to in 3 buckets. We had EDGE networking, consumer and industrial. Neither of those are dominant categories. So you should think of all 3 as contributing very materially to the total amount of revenue.
Maybe I'll highlight a couple of things. Within EDGE networking, both the Wi-Fi access point business and the 5G fixed wireless business, they're both very strong for us. And especially when you think about the 5G fixed wireless business, we're really at the very front end of that having a very material impact for us. So we're looking forward to the growth that, that offers to us over the next several years. In the consumer business, clearly, there is a very broad set of products we have. The revenue is split between several products. But then also as you look forward, the opportunity within the next-generation PCs and AR VR are very material things that could be -- material growth drivers going forward.
And then within industrial, that's a very broad field, and we're really not even in the first innings on that market. So a long ways to go for us and we're excited all these markets are looking for technologies from us."

Also, we're starting to see digital cockpit becoming more material in the revenue, which is really a much richer silicon opportunity for us as we look at the dashboard, the infotainment, rear seat entertainment, heads-up display, smart mirrors, smart side view mirrors and so forth.

And as you know, the Snapdragon premium tier devices, there are a lot more revenues in earnings compared, for example, to just the modem technology alone.
And the last comment I want to make into this, we're just at the beginning of this opportunity. We're showing with 5G a much better mix across the devices. The market is moving towards premium and high. We're very well positioned in the space. And over time, with our investments we've been doing in CPU with NUVIA, we expect to take the differentiation to a whole another level. Thank you."

So those are reasonable data points to project forward to get to an annual number for the licensing business.
There are a few things that could drive upside on top of that. But again, we think of it as upside opportunities. The growth outside handsets is a factor. Second is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're seeing a mix shift that's very positive for us. And so as mix shift continues, we'll see the benefit in QCT, but we'll also see the benefit in QTL. And so that would be another upside driver. And especially with 5G penetrating the lower tiers, that will be a factor for QTL as well. And again, it will show up through better ASPs and as a result, better revenues. So hopefully, that helps in framing the forward path for it."

Thanks for joining us today. As the pace of digital transformation of industries accelerates and as devices become connected and more intelligent, our broad portfolio of technologies and solutions is creating a significant long-term growth opportunity for us. 
As you can see from our results, the performance in our chipset business led to record fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55. Notably, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year EBITDA growth in our chipset business. 
We also demonstrated revenue diversification with combined RF front-end automotive and IoT fiscal '21 revenues exceeding $10 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Going forward, our chipset business represents the largest growth engine for us as virtually all devices at the edge adopt mobile technologies. We have the relevant technologies required to continue to lead in mobile and the connected intelligent edge. And as the edge gains scale in connectivity and adopts own device artificial intelligence, we're well positioned to become a leader in AI processing. 
Let me now briefly highlight the strong momentum we continue to see in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial. In consumer, we're pleased that our XR platforms are powering over 50 commercial devices and gaining scale with the leading VR and AR ecosystems. Our early investments have established Snapdragon XR as a device platform of choice for connecting physical and digital spaces. And recent market developments position us as one of the key enablers of the metaverse opportunity. 
Additionally, the ongoing conversions of mobile and compute continues to drive demand for Snapdragon-powered premium tablets 2-in-1s and laptops. We are pleased with the strong market validation of ARM-based personal computing in the industry transition to a new SoC architecture. We're more confident than ever in the connected computing opportunity, our upcoming solutions powered by our NUVIA CPUs and our collaboration with Microsoft. 
We're also seeing increased traction in consumer electronics. Our advanced technologies are powering category-leading devices such as the Peloton Bike+ [indiscernible] as well as the ASTRO, Amazon's recently announced household robot. 
In edge networking, we are a leader in current and next-generation high-performance WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E access point solutions. And we continue to see high demand for our products driven by home and enterprise upgrade cycles. We expect this trend to continue as productivity increasingly requires video collaboration as well as cloud processing and storage. 
5G as wireless fiber is now a reality in gaining scale. In the United States, Verizon recently announced 5G Home Internet service availability in 57 markets, including more than 2 million households covered on millimeter wave. In addition, T-Mobile is leveraging their 5G network to target 7 million to 8 million home broadband customers over the next 5 years. We're seeing demand increase globally, making 5G as wireless fiber one of the fastest-growing last mile broadband technologies. 
In industrial, we have expanded our Qualcomm IoT services suite to more than 30 verticals. As an example, in retail, our solutions are powering digital signage, payment and self-checkout devices from companies like Square and Clover as well as solutions from Honeywell, Panasonic, Zebra and others to enable new customer experiences, help empower store associates and improve operational efficiencies. 
We also continue to lead the way on product innovation with new launches like the Qualcomm Flight RB5, the world's first 5G AI drone platform. In RF front-end, we expanded our product portfolio with our recently announced ultraBAW RF filter technology that support frequencies from 2.7 gigahertz to 7.2 gigahertz. This is the new industry benchmark for performance in this range. UltraBAW technology also supports WiFi bands, including 5 gigahertz, the newly adopted 6 gigahertz band for WiFi 6E and future WiFi standards. This creates a new growth vector for RF front-end as we attach RF solutions to Wi-Fi. 
Our RF front-end portfolio, combining UltraSAW and UltraBAW technologies is now best in class from 600 megahertz to 7 gigahertz. And with the addition of millimeter wave, we are the only RF front-end provider with a comprehensive solution for all bands. As cellular expands beyond handsets, we're focused on extending our modem to antenna platform to automotive and IoT. 
In automotive, we're creating a leading horizontal and open platform with our Snapdragon digital chassis, which includes our telematics, digital cockpit, car-to-cloud service, ADAS and autonomy solutions. Taking the same approach we used to make smartphone, the world's largest computing and developer platform. We're collaborating with automakers and Tier 1s to create a joint road map to build multitier, multigeneration, scalable and upgradable platforms for long-term sustainable business. 
The strength of our digital chassis strategy is reflected in both our results as well as a strong design pipeline and is creating a platform for innovation for Auto. We are also very excited about Arriver. Upon closing, Snapdragon Ride ADAS solutions will be complemented with Arriver's computer vision, drive policy and driver assistant assets, enhancing our ability to deliver on an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and Tier 1s at scale. 
In handsets, we're successfully executing on our strategy. Our premium tier Snapdragon solutions continue to gain traction with OEMs. In fiscal Q4, devices announced or shipped with our Snapdragon premium tier products increased by 21% year-over-year. Notably, all leading 5G Android smartphones OEMs by volume continue to power their flagship devices with Snapdragon. 
Snapdragon continues to be the preferred choice for premium and high-tier Android smartphones in all regions. As a result, we're benefiting from the changing OEM landscape in Android TAM expansion. 
Lastly, our licensing business achieved fiscal '21 revenues in excess of $6.3 billion. QTL remains the most successful licensing business in the industry, reflecting the strength of our innovation in cellular technology, the value of our extensive patent portfolio and our execution in securing long-term agreements with key OEMs and as well as over 150 5G agreements to date. 
As we have noted throughout the year, we continue to see incredibly strong demand across all our technologies as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. We still expect material improvements to our supply by the end of the calendar year and our second sourcing initiatives remain on track. 
Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to highlight that we recently announced a goal to achieve net 0 global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040. We also look forward to enabling a more sustainable future with 5G through its impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy and water use optimization, green jobs creation and more. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

We are pleased to announce record fourth fiscal quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.55, reflecting year-over-year growth of 43% and 76%, respectively. For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $7.7 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both above the high end of our guidance. 
QCT EBT of $2.5 billion grew by 143% versus the year ago quarter on revenue growth of 56% and 12 points of EBIT margin expansion. We also delivered record revenues in each of QCT revenue streams: handsets, RF front-end, IoT and automotive. 
Handset revenues of $4.7 billion increased 56% year-over-year on strong demand across all major OEMs. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 45% year-over-year and included the benefit of pull-in of demand in advance of certain holiday launches. IoT revenues were up 66% year-over-year to $1.5 billion as digital transformation continues to drive higher demand across our diversified customer base. Automotive revenues of $270 million grew 44% year-over-year on the ramp of digital cockpit launches and continued strength in telematics. QTL Revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 72% were in line with guidance. These results reflect slightly lower-than-expected units, offset by favorable mix. Lastly, we delivered GAAP EPS of $2.45, $0.47 above the high end of our guidance, driven by record non-GAAP earnings and approximately $500 million of gains in our QSI investment portfolio. 
Now I would like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal '21. We are exceeding all targets we set at our 2019 Analyst Day, which is a year earlier than forecasted. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 26% in QTL and 64% in QCT, and more than doubled non-GAAP EPS to $8.54. 
In QCT, we had greater than 50% year-over-year growth in each of our revenue streams and EBITDA margins expanded from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. Within handsets, our Android revenues for our Snapdragon chipsets were approximately 40% higher than our primary competitor. With our focus on diversification, RF front-end, automotive and IoT accounted for 38% of total QCT revenues. Lastly, we returned 74% of our free cash flow to stockholders, including $3 billion in dividends and $3.4 billion in stock repurchases. 
Turning to our guidance for handset units in the first fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we are narrowing the range for 5G handsets to 500 million to 550 million units. We are now forecasting mid- to high-single-digit growth in global 3G/4G/5G handsets relative to calendar 2020. 
For the first fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 to $3.10. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 32% and EBT dollar growth of 49%. The sequential revenue growth is driven by handsets due to higher demand, primarily for our Snapdragon chipsets in Android devices. 
Following a record performance in the fourth quarter, we expect nonhandset revenues to remain in line sequentially. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect QTL revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and EBT margins of 74% to 78%. This forecast assumes sequential unit growth in line with historical trends. 
Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease 2% to 3% sequentially. As a reminder, operating expenses are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter as it includes calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. 
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will be another exciting year for Qualcomm with year-over-year EPS growth expected to exceed 20%, driven by strength across all QCT revenue streams. In handsets, we are positioned to benefit from the $10 billion SAM expansion due to the changing OEM landscape. A portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and we also expect it to contribute to the rest of fiscal '22. 
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their leadership and contributions in making 2021 successful. Finally, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 16, where we will provide additional detail about our growth strategy. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

But really, we are planning to address this in a lot more detail in a couple of weeks. I'll ask you to hold until then. 
If you see our gross margin performance in the September quarter that we just reported, very strong gross margins, and we are forecasting in similar range going into the December quarter. 
And then year-over-year, if you look at the full year, so abstract back from the seasonality, we went from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. And so we feel obviously very comfortable with that number. And in a couple of weeks, we'll talk about how the combination of revenue growth and gross margin percentage and R&D leverage will take us going forward."

There are 2, I think, answers to your question. The first one is continue to track exactly as we expected. We have millimeter wave in the United States. It's now commercially available in Japan across all carriers, Docomo, SoftBank, KDDI, even the new carrier Rakuten. And we continue to be optimistic about the opportunity of millimeter wave becoming commercial over time in China. 
The first milestone is the millimeter wave for the Winter Olympics early 2022. Japan is moving for millimeter wave and nothing has changed to carriers' plans to continue to build this technology. And there are a number of commercial millimeter wave smartphones in Japan, that includes the Galaxy note the GS21 and Galaxy Fold and Sony. And from our perspective, just knowing what we know of wireless and how the growth of data is going in the spectrum efficiency, millimeter wave is inevitable, just a matter of time. And it's just different markets will deploy at different speeds, but that's how we get more spectrum and our position in millimeter wave remains unchanged."

I'll say that a portion of the weakness was driven by supply imbalances at certain OEMs. And so that did impact the demand to a certain extent, but that's one of the key factors we saw happening. Within the market, though, 5G continues to be very strong. So we're seeing 2 trends in China. First is the transition to kind of there's a variance month-to-month, but very, very strong in the high 70s percent has already transitioned to 5G. And so we are raising the guidance, the midpoint of the guidance for 5G to now 525 million units.

Thanks for joining us today. As the pace of digital transformation of industries accelerates and as devices become connected and more intelligent, our broad portfolio of technologies and solutions is creating a significant long-term growth opportunity for us.
As you can see from our results, the performance in our chipset business led to record fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55. Notably, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year EBT growth in our chipset business.
We also demonstrated revenue diversification with combined RF front-end, automotive and IoT fiscal '21 revenues exceeding $10 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Going forward, our chipset business represents the largest growth engine for us as virtually all devices at the edge adopt mobile technologies. We have the relevant technologies required to continue to lead in mobile and the connected intelligent edge. And as the edge gains scale in connectivity and adopts own device artificial intelligence, we're well positioned to become a leader in AI processing.
Let me now briefly highlight the strong momentum we continue to see in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial. In consumer, we're pleased that our XR platforms are powering over 50 commercial devices and gaining scale with the leading VR and AR ecosystems. Our early investments have established Snapdragon XR as a device platform of choice for connecting physical and digital spaces. And recent market developments position us as one of the key enablers of the metaverse opportunity.
Additionally, the ongoing conversions of mobile and compute continues to drive demand for Snapdragon-powered premium tablets, 2-in-1s and laptops. We are pleased with the strong market validation of ARM-based personal computing in the industry transition to a new SoC architecture. We're more confident than ever in the connected computing opportunity, our upcoming solutions powered by our NUVIA CPUs and our collaboration with Microsoft.
We're also seeing increased traction in consumer electronics. Our advanced technologies are powering category-leading devices such as the Peloton Bike+ in tread as well as the ASTRO, Amazon's recently announced household robot.
In edge networking, we are a leader in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E access point solutions. And we continue to see high demand for our products driven by home and enterprise upgrade cycles. We expect this trend to continue as productivity increasingly requires video collaboration as well as cloud processing and storage.
5G as wireless fiber is now a reality in gaining scale. In the United States, Verizon recently announced 5G home Internet service availability in 57 markets, including more than 2 million households covered on millimeter wave. In addition, T-Mobile is leveraging their 5G network to target 7 million to 8 million home broadband customers over the next 5 years. We're seeing demand increase globally, making 5G as wireless fiber one of the fastest-growing last-mile broadband technologies.
In industrial, we have expanded our Qualcomm IoT services suite to more than 30 verticals. As an example, in retail, our solutions are powering digital signage, payment and self-checkout devices from companies like Square and Clover as well as solutions from Honeywell, Panasonic, Zebra and others to enable new customer experiences, help empower store associates and improve operational efficiencies.
We also continue to lead the way on product innovation with new launches like the Qualcomm Flight RB5, the world's first 5G AI drone platform. In RF front-end, we expanded our product portfolio with our recently announced ultraBAW RF filter technology that support frequencies from 2.7 gigahertz to 7.2 gigahertz. This is the new industry benchmark for performance in this range. ultraBAW technology also supports Wi-Fi bands, including 5 gigahertz, the newly adopted 6 gigahertz band for Wi-Fi 6E and future Wi-Fi standards. This creates a new growth vector for RF front-end as we attach RF solutions to Wi-Fi.
Our RF front-end portfolio, combining ultraSAW and ultraBAW technologies is now best-in-class from 600 megahertz to 7 gigahertz. And with the addition of millimeter wave, we are the only RF front-end provider with a comprehensive solution for all bands. As cellular expands beyond handsets, we're focused on extending our modem-to-antenna platform to automotive and IoT.
In automotive, we're creating a leading horizontal and open platform with our Snapdragon digital chassis, which includes our telematics, digital cockpit, Car-to-Cloud service, ADAS and autonomy solutions. Taking the same approach we used to make smartphone the world's largest computing and developer platform, we're currently working with automakers and Tier 1s to create a joint road map to build multi-tier, multi-generation, scalable and upgradable platforms for long-term sustainable business.
The strength of our digital chassis strategy is reflected in both our results as well as a strong design pipeline and is creating a platform for innovation for auto. We are also very excited about Arriver. Upon closing, Snapdragon Ride ADAS solutions will be complemented with Arriver's computer vision, drive policy and driver assistant assets, enhancing our ability to deliver on an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and Tier 1s at scale.
In handsets, we're successfully executing on our strategy. Our premium tier Snapdragon solutions continue to gain traction with OEMs. In fiscal Q4, devices announced or shipped with our Snapdragon premium tier products increased by 21% year-over-year. Notably, all leading 5G Android smartphones OEMs by volume continue to power their flagship devices with Snapdragon.
Snapdragon continues to be the preferred choice for premium and high-tier Android smartphones in all regions. As a result, we're benefiting from the changing OEM landscape in Android SAM expansion.
Lastly, our licensing business achieved fiscal '21 revenues in excess of $6.3 billion. QTL remains the most successful licensing business in the industry, reflecting the strength of our innovation in cellular technology, the value of our extensive patent portfolio and our execution in securing long-term agreements with key OEMs as well as over 150 5G agreements to date.
As we have noted throughout the year, we continue to see incredibly strong demand across all our technologies as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. We still expect material improvements to our supply by the end of the calendar year, and our second sourcing initiatives remain on track.
Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to highlight that we recently announced a goal to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040. We also look forward to enabling a more sustainable future with 5G through its impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy and water use optimization, green jobs creation and more.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

For QCT,",714,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to announce record fourth fiscal quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.55, reflecting year-over-year growth of 43% and 76%, respectively. For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $7.7 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both above the high end of our guidance. QCT EBT of $2.5 billion grew by 143% versus the year ago quarter on revenue growth of 56% and 12 points of EBT margin expansion.
We also delivered record revenues in each of QCT revenue streams: handsets, RF front-end, IoT and automotive. Handset revenues of $4.7 billion increased 56% year-over-year on strong demand across all major OEMs. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 45% year-over-year and included the benefit of pull-in of demand in advance of certain holiday launches. IoT revenues were up 66% year-over-year to $1.5 billion as digital transformation continues to drive higher demand across our diversified customer base. Automotive revenues of $270 million grew 44% year-over-year on the ramp of digital cockpit launches and continued strength in telematics.
QTL revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 72% were in line with guidance. These results reflect slightly lower-than-expected units, offset by favorable mix.
Lastly, we delivered GAAP EPS of $2.45, $0.47 above the high end of our guidance, driven by record non-GAAP earnings and approximately $500 million of gains in our QSI investment portfolio.
Now I would like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal '21. We are exceeding all targets we set at our 2019 Analyst Day, which is a year earlier than forecasted. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 26% in QTL and 64% in QCT, and more than doubled non-GAAP EPS to $8.54.
In QCT, we had greater than 50% year-over-year growth in each of our revenue streams, and EBT margins expanded from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. Within handsets, our Android revenues for our Snapdragon chipsets were approximately 40% higher than our primary competitor. With our focus on diversification, RF front-end, automotive and IoT accounted for 38% of total QCT revenues.
Lastly, we returned 74% of our free cash flow to stockholders, including $3 billion in dividends and $3.4 billion in stock repurchases.
Turning to our guidance for handset units in the first fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we are narrowing the range for 5G handsets to 500 million to 550 million units. We are now forecasting mid- to high-single-digit growth in global 3G/4G/5G handsets relative to calendar 2020.
For the first fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 to $3.10. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 32% and EBT dollar growth of 49%. The sequential revenue growth is driven by handsets due to higher demand, primarily for our Snapdragon chipsets in Android devices.
Following a record performance in the fourth quarter, we expect nonhandset revenues to remain in line sequentially. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect QTL revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and EBT margins of 74% to 78%. This forecast assumes sequential unit growth in line with historical trends.
Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease 2% to 3% sequentially. As a reminder, operating expenses are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter as it includes calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs.
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will be another exciting year for Qualcomm with year-over-year EPS growth expected to exceed 20%, driven by strength across all QCT revenue streams. In handsets, we are positioned to benefit from the $10 billion SAM expansion due to the changing OEM landscape. A portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and we also expect it to contribute to the rest of fiscal '22.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their leadership and contributions in making 2021 successful. Finally, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 16 where we will provide additional detail about our growth strategy.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio."

And a portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and that's also contemplated in the greater than 20% EPS growth we are suggesting.

And then year-over-year, if you look at the full year, so abstract back from the seasonality, we went from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. And so we feel obviously very comfortable with that number. And in a couple of weeks, we'll talk about how the combination of revenue growth and gross margin percentage and R&D leverage will take us going forward."

There are 2, I think, answers to your question. The first one is continue to track exactly as we expected. We have millimeter wave in the United States. It's now commercially available in Japan across all carriers, Docomo, SoftBank, KDDI, even the new carrier Rakuten. And we continue to be optimistic about the opportunity of millimeter wave becoming commercial over time in China.
The first milestone is the millimeter wave for the Winter Olympics early 2022. Japan is moving for millimeter wave, and nothing has changed to carriers' plans to continue to build this technology. And there are a number of commercial millimeter wave smartphones in Japan that includes the Galaxy Note the GS21 and Galaxy Fold and Sony. And from our perspective, just knowing what we know of wireless and how the growth of data is going in the spectrum efficiency, millimeter wave is inevitable. It's just a matter of time. And it's just different markets will deploy at different speeds, but that's how we get more spectrum, and our position in millimeter wave remains unchanged."

On your question on the second quarter, we're obviously not guiding the quarter at this point.

I'll say that a portion of the weakness was driven by supply imbalances at certain OEMs. And so that did impact the demand to a certain extent, but that's one of the key factors we saw happening.
Within the market, though, 5G continues to be very strong. So we're seeing 2 trends in China. First is the transition to 5G, kind of there's a variance month-to-month, but very, very strong, in the high 70s percent has already transitioned to 5G. And so we are raising the guidance, the midpoint of the guidance for 5G to now 525 million units.

Do you think you might get a benefit from all the handset OEMs that are leaving revenue behind on the table, along with your premium? Or do you think it's just again your own chipsets that are getting benefit from launch of new chipsets?"

Thanks for joining us today. As the pace of digital transformation of industries accelerates and as devices become connected and more intelligent, our broad portfolio of technologies and solutions is creating a significant long-term growth opportunity for us.
    
    As you can see from our results, the performance in our chipset business led to record fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55. Notably, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year EBT growth in our chipset business.
    
    We also demonstrated revenue diversification with combined RF front-end, automotive and IoT fiscal '21 revenues exceeding $10 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Going forward, our chipset business represents the largest growth engine for us as virtually all devices at the edge adopt mobile technologies. We have the relevant technologies required to continue to lead in mobile and the connected intelligent edge. And as the edge gains scale in connectivity and adopts own device artificial intelligence, we're well positioned to become a leader in AI processing.
    
    Let me now briefly highlight the strong momentum we continue to see in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial. In consumer, we're pleased that our XR platforms are powering over 50 commercial devices and gaining scale with the leading VR and AR ecosystems. Our early investments have established Snapdragon XR as a device platform of choice for connecting physical and digital spaces. And recent market developments position us as one of the key enablers of the metaverse opportunity.
    
    Additionally, the ongoing conversions of mobile and compute continues to drive demand for Snapdragon-powered premium tablets, 2-in-1s and laptops. We are pleased with the strong market validation of ARM-based personal computing in the industry transition to a new SoC architecture. We're more confident than ever in the connected computing opportunity, our upcoming solutions powered by our NUVIA CPUs and our collaboration with Microsoft.
    
    We're also seeing increased traction in consumer electronics. Our advanced technologies are powering category-leading devices such as the Peloton Bike+ in tread as well as the Astro, Amazon's recently announced household robot.
    
    In edge networking, we are a leader in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E access point solutions. And we continue to see high demand for our products driven by home and enterprise upgrade cycles. We expect this trend to continue as productivity increasingly requires video collaboration as well as cloud processing and storage.
    
    5G as wireless fiber is now a reality in gaining scale. In the United States, Verizon recently announced 5G home Internet service availability in 57 markets, including more than 2 million households covered on millimeter wave. In addition, T-Mobile is leveraging their 5G network to target 7 million to 8 million home broadband customers over the next 5 years. We're seeing demand increase globally, making 5G as wireless fiber one of the fastest-growing last-mile broadband technologies.
    
    In industrial, we have expanded our Qualcomm IoT services suite to more than 30 verticals. As an example, in retail, our solutions are powering digital signage, payment and self-checkout devices from companies like Square and Clover as well as solutions from Honeywell, Panasonic, Zebra and others to enable new customer experiences, help empower store associates and improve operational efficiencies.
    
    We also continue to lead the way on product innovation with new launches like the Qualcomm Flight RB5, the world's first 5G AI drone platform. In RF front-end, we expanded our product portfolio with our recently announced ultraBAW RF filter technology that support frequencies from 2.7 gigahertz to 7.2 gigahertz. This is the new industry benchmark for performance in this range. ultraBAW technology also supports Wi-Fi bands, including 5 gigahertz, the newly adopted 6 gigahertz band for Wi-Fi 6E and future Wi-Fi standards. This creates a new growth vector for RF front-end as we attach RF solutions to Wi-Fi.
    
    Our RF front-end portfolio, combining ultraSAW and ultraBAW technologies, is now best-in-class from 600 megahertz to 7 gigahertz. And with the addition of millimeter wave, we are the only RF front-end provider with a comprehensive solution for all bands. As cellular expands beyond handsets, we're focused on extending our modem-to-antenna platform to automotive and IoT.
    
    In automotive, we're creating a leading horizontal and open platform with our Snapdragon digital chassis, which includes our telematics, digital cockpit, Car-to-Cloud service, ADAS and autonomy solutions. Taking the same approach we used to make smartphone, the world's largest computing and developer platform, we're currently working with automakers and Tier 1s to create a joint road map to build multi-tier, multi-generation, scalable and upgradable platforms for long-term sustainable business.
    
    The strength of our digital chassis strategy is reflected in both our results as well as a strong design pipeline and is creating a platform for innovation for auto. We are also very excited about Arriver. Upon closing, Snapdragon Ride ADAS solutions will be complemented with Arriver's computer vision, drive policy and driver assistant assets, enhancing our ability to deliver on an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and Tier 1s at scale.
    
    In handsets, we're successfully executing on our strategy. Our premium tier Snapdragon solutions continue to gain traction with OEMs. In fiscal Q4, devices announced or shipped with our Snapdragon premium tier products increased by 21% year-over-year. Notably, all leading 5G Android smartphones OEMs by volume continue to power their flagship devices with Snapdragon.
    Snapdragon continues to be the preferred choice for premium and high-tier Android smartphones in all regions. As a result, we're benefiting from the changing OEM landscape in Android SAM expansion.
    
    Lastly, our licensing business achieved fiscal '21 revenues in excess of $6.3 billion. QTL remains the most successful licensing business in the industry, reflecting the strength of our innovation in cellular technology, the value of our extensive patent portfolio and our execution in securing long-term agreements with key OEMs as well as over 150 5G agreements to date.
    
    As we have noted throughout the year, we continue to see incredibly strong demand across all our technologies as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. We still expect material improvements to our supply by the end of the calendar year, and our second sourcing initiatives remain on track.
    
    Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to highlight that we recently announced a goal to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040. We also look forward to enabling a more sustainable future with 5G through its impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy and water use optimization, green jobs creation and more.
    
    I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."

We are pleased to announce record fourth fiscal quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.55, reflecting year-over-year growth of 43% and 76%, respectively.",714,"Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone.
    
    We are pleased to announce record fourth fiscal quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.55, reflecting year-over-year growth of 43% and 76%, respectively. For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $7.7 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both above the high end of our guidance. QCT EBT of $2.5 billion grew by 143% versus the year ago quarter on revenue growth of 56% and 12 points of EBT margin expansion.
    
    We also delivered record revenues in each of QCT revenue streams: handsets, RF front-end, IoT and automotive. Handset revenues of $4.7 billion increased 56% year-over-year on strong demand across all major OEMs. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 45% year-over-year and included the benefit of pull-in of demand in advance of certain holiday launches. IoT revenues were up 66% year-over-year to $1.5 billion as digital transformation continues to drive higher demand across our diversified customer base. Automotive revenues of $270 million grew 44% year-over-year on the ramp of digital cockpit launches and continued strength in telematics.
    
    QTL revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 72% were in line with guidance. These results reflect slightly lower-than-expected units, offset by favorable mix.
    
    Lastly, we delivered GAAP EPS of $2.45, $0.47 above the high end of our guidance, driven by record non-GAAP earnings and approximately $500 million of gains in our QSI investment portfolio.
    
    Now I would like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal '21. We are exceeding all targets we set at our 2019 Analyst Day, which is a year earlier than forecasted. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 26% in QTL and 64% in QCT, and more than doubled non-GAAP EPS to $8.54.
    
    In QCT, we had greater than 50% year-over-year growth in each of our revenue streams, and EBT margins expanded from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. Within handsets, our Android revenues for our Snapdragon chipsets were approximately 40% higher than our primary competitor. With our focus on diversification, RF front-end, automotive and IoT accounted for 38% of total QCT revenues.
    
    Lastly, we returned 74% of our free cash flow to stockholders, including $3 billion in dividends and $3.4 billion in stock repurchases.
    
    Turning to our guidance for handset units in the first fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we are narrowing the range for 5G handsets to 500 million to 550 million units. We are now forecasting mid- to high-single-digit growth in global 3G/4G/5G handsets relative to calendar 2020.
    
    For the first fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 to $3.10. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 32% and EBT dollar growth of 49%. The sequential revenue growth is driven by handsets due to higher demand, primarily for our Snapdragon chipsets in Android devices.
    
    Following the record performance in the fourth quarter, we expect nonhandset revenues to remain in line sequentially. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect QTL revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and EBT margins of 74% to 78%. This forecast assumes sequential unit growth in line with historical trends.
    
    Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease 2% to 3% sequentially. As a reminder, operating expenses are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter as it includes calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs.
    
    Looking forward, fiscal '22 will be another exciting year for Qualcomm with year-over-year EPS growth expected to exceed 20%, driven by strength across all QCT revenue streams. In handsets, we are positioned to benefit from the $10 billion SAM expansion due to the changing OEM landscape. A portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and we also expect it to contribute to the rest of fiscal '22.
    
    Before I finish my prepared remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their leadership and contributions in making 2021 successful. Finally, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 16 where we will provide additional detail about our growth strategy.

There are 2, I think, answers to your question. The first one is continue to track exactly as we expected. We have millimeter wave in the United States. It's now commercially available in Japan across all carriers, Docomo, SoftBank, KDDI, even the new carrier Rakuten. And we continue to be optimistic about the opportunity of millimeter wave becoming commercial over time in China.
    
    The first milestone is the millimeter wave for the Winter Olympics early 2022. Japan is moving for millimeter wave, and nothing has changed to carriers' plans to continue to build this technology. And there are a number of commercial millimeter wave smartphones in Japan that includes the Galaxy Note the GS21 and Galaxy Fold and Sony. And from our perspective, just knowing what we know of wireless and how the growth of data is going in the spectrum efficiency, millimeter wave is inevitable. It's just a matter of time. And it's just different markets will deploy at different speeds, but that's how we get more spectrum, and our position in millimeter wave remains unchanged."

    I'll say that a portion of the weakness was driven by supply imbalances at certain OEMs. And so that did impact the demand to a certain extent, but that's one of the key factors we saw happening.
    
    Within the market, though, 5G continues to be very strong. So we're seeing 2 trends in China. First is the transition to 5G, kind of there's a variance month-to-month, but very, very strong, in the high 70s percent has already transitioned to 5G. And so we are raising the guidance, the midpoint of the guidance for 5G to now 525 million units.

Or do you think it's just again your own chipsets that are getting benefit from launch of new chipsets?"

But given the launch of our new chipset and really all the other chipset launches we have done over the last month, we feel like we will be in a very strong position to expand our units within the Android market.
    
    And then the second thing I said is nonhandset growth. We expect nonhandsets, all 3 to grow within the quarter as well."

I think you said at the Analyst Day that you were targeting more than 20% share of an $18 billion TAM next year. But you're now annualizing to almost $5 billion. So either that market is a lot bigger or your share is a lot higher. So can you just comment on that?
    
    And then secondly, I had a question on the contract with the big customer. Can you just level set us? Cristiano, you just alluded to it. So can you level set us? I think it goes through 2024. But can you just help us on the timing of that?"

So yes, there's some ways to go, and we'll definitely plan to address that at Analyst Day in a couple of weeks."
