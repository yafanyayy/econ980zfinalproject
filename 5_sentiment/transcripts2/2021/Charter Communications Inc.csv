The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide and our robust network handled an immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and telehealth services.
Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016, and it showed up in our 2020 performance.
For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5%. And we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%.
Our residential business performed particularly well, with strength in Internet, and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business, given the quality and value of our product.
Despite the outsized growth and some pull forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward. Our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet adds that we achieved in 2019. And we believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced.
COVID-19 hurt our small business and enterprise businesses, but trends in those parts of our businesses are improving, and we're on our way back to our previous growth rates or better. Our core ad business also suffered, but it's now bouncing back and core advertising is 95% of what we would have expected from a revenue perspective. We anticipate our advertising business will make a full recovery, with the timing of that recovery dependent on the full recovery of the economy.
2020 also resulted in the acceleration of efficiency in our core operations. Our self-installation program expanded dramatically from about 50% of sales before the pandemic to a new steady state of over 80% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2020, driving cost savings and improving customer satisfaction. We saw a significant increase in the use of our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, which drives cost savings and higher customer satisfaction.
As we reflect on our 2020 operating performance, we also demonstrated our commitment to our customers, the communities we serve and our employees. We launched a number of community programs, including a remote education offer and the Keep America Connected pledge. In addition, we significantly expanded our spectrum news coverage areas and opened up our spectrum news websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information. We rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video customers.
For our employees, we offered additional paid sick time for COVID related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer call center employees. Our efforts have been recognized by our employees, the local communities and customers we serve and related stakeholders, which brings long-term benefits.
Looking forward, we remain committed to offering a $20 minimum wage and our strategy of employing an in-sourced U.S.-based workforce that offers a long-term career path for our employees. And our call centers and all of our employees are now 100% U.S.-based. Our plans to expand our footprint in rural areas will increase broadband access and help connect well over 1 million homes, which have gone unserved until now. And that doesn't even include our regular build out to lower density areas, which accelerated in 2020. We continue to offer our Spectrum Internet assist program to millions of lower income households at affordable prices. And as we look forward to the rest of 2021, we remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality services and products under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions.
Over the coming months, we plan to add multiple streaming video applications to our deployed world boxes, and all incremental video connections, making it easier for our video customers to access today's most popular streaming content through 1 device.
Our Internet product also continues to improve during the fourth quarter, we expanded the delivery of our minimum speed offerings of 200 megabits from about 60% of our footprint to close to 75% of our footprint. In the near term, we have a large opportunity to improve data throughput and latency on our network by using our DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still offers us a long runway to improve our product set. We'll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors in the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality down the road.
We're also improving the quality of our WiFi routers and WiFi reception in the home. We recently launched our new WiFi 6 router in our first market, and we will have WiFi 6 router available in nearly all markets by mid-2021. And we now offer companion WiFi pods to improve WiFi reception in the home. Our advanced in home WiFi service, which is a managed WiFi service that provides customers the ability to optimize their networks while providing greater control of their connected devices has now been launched across more than 65% of our footprint for new connects, and we will continue to expand that footprint this year.
And our mobile service now offers free access to nationwide 5G service. We recently spent $465 million to purchase 210 CBRS priority access licenses. We intend to use those licenses, along with significant unlicensed CBRS spectrum on a targeted 5G small cell site strategy, with our HFC network providing power and backhaul. Those small cells, combined with improving WiFi capabilities enable better throughput while driving significantly better economics for charter. This year, we'll focus on scaling our systems to actively manage traffic on handsets using our MVNO, Wifi, CBRS spectrum. We will also build some targeted 5G small cell sites, which will help us learn how to pace our purely return on investment based CBRS deployment.
In closing, as we look back on 2020, we're very pleased with our performance as it demonstrates that our operating strategy works well for Charter communities, employees and shareholders even in challenging economic and operating environments. And despite the onetime impacts to our P&L, which Chris will cover, we ended the year well ahead of where we expected from a customer growth perspective, providing a higher level of subscription-based revenue and underlying EBITDA than what we would have expected.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."

Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief re",1677,"Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter, and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, Set Up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022.
Looking at Slide 6, including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down $93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter, because our first 3 quarters of this year were above last year's first 3 quarters by $900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by $2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis.
The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to charter earlier in the year, plus lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year.
Trends have been improving more recently and subject to COVID and economic developments, we currently expect full year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019.
Residential and SMB video customers declined by $35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by $56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by $103,000 in the quarter and by $148,000 for the full year.
Mobile line net adds grew by $315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels, and the lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely, and we're not giving away free handsets to do it.
For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines, and we believe we were the fastest-growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6%, excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3%, excluding political.
Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that we're no longer isolating cable specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics but we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021.
A few comments on the most notable fourth quarter expense items, including certain COVID related expense impacts during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 on Slide 9. The regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses declined by 10.7%, primarily driven by NBA games pushed into 2021. The cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year, driven by 6.5% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year and COVID flex time benefits to employees. That was partly offset by lower bad debt, which is due to better payment trends during COVID.
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in net income attributable to charter shareholders. And as shown on Slide 11, our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion, including just over $500 million in mobile as we continue to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage, and we haven't slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas.
We continued to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and equipment upgrades and saw a high attach rate for our advanced in-home WiFi service. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar or lower than in 2020. We're still in the art of quiet period, and we'll isolate those effects for investors in the future.
We expect our 2021 mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2020 levels as we build out more mobile stores than we originally anticipated, and we will spend some dollars to scale our CBRS efforts in mobile back office systems. Leaving aside the pace of ROI-based deployment of small cells, we would expect mobile CapEx for stores and systems to be materially lower in '22 and beyond.
We generated $7.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow in 2020, up 53% from 2019. Currently, we don't expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022.
For the full year 2020, we repurchased 21 million Charter shares and Charter holdings common units, approximately 7% of our shares and units for $12.1 billion. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased nearly $40 billion of stock or approximately 32% of our shares and units at an average price of $394 per share.
Let me now focus on how 2020 sets up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Last year's customer growth was extraordinary, and we saw a significant demand for our products early on, across the existing base and those newly acquired customers, we had record low churn of all types through the remainder of the year, which also reduced sales opportunities in the market in the second half. As Tom mentioned, we added nearly 2 million customer relationships compared to 1.1 million in 2019, and we added 2.2 million broadband customers compared to 1.4 million in 2019. And yet, total transaction activity in 2020, which is the sum of gross connects and churn was actually lower than in 2019, driven by very low churn during the pandemic.
Last year's financial activity was also unique. From a revenue perspective, 2020 was pressured by the sale of Navisite in 2019 and COVID related reductions for the Keep Americans Connected program and sports programming credits earlier in the year.
From a cost perspective, we saw savings in a number of areas. In programming, the interruption and cancellation of sporting events drove $163 million of sports cost savings. Similarly, the cancellation and shift of games also drove cost reductions and timing benefits of over $200 million in our regulatory connectivity and produced content line related to our Lakers and Dodgers RSNs. Cost to service customers benefited from lower customer transactions and historically low bad debt, but that was more than offset by wage increases and covered flex time we provided to our employees. In total, 2020 adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.9%.
For 2021, our baseline assumption is that the COVID-19 vaccine will be widely dispensed and that the economy will return to normal activity by the middle of this year. But the reality is that we don't know. But that assumption suggests that the full year 2021 customer net adds should look more like full year 2019 net adds with a return to more normal term levels, driving higher transaction activity, including higher connect activity than in 2020 despite lower net adds. Not only were quarterly net add growth comparisons to 2020 be somewhat irrelevant but the current environment will drive abnormal variances when comparing individual quarters to 2019. And our underlying 2021 financial performance will be difficult to discern without the use of our 2020 COVID schedules shown on Slide 9 and on a quarterly basis, again on Slide 19.
From a financial perspective, we expect 2021 revenue growth to benefit from the significant customer growth we had in 2020, the lack of COVID related credits in '21 and an improving S&B, core advertising and enterprise outlook, partly offset by the absence of political advertising revenue in 2021, all of which means we'll see a significant year-over-year growth rate squeeze between quarters.
From a cost perspective, we expect 2021 programming to grow at a higher rate than last year, in part because we don't expect last year's sports programming credits to recur.
Regulatory connectivity and produced content will also face a onetime step-up due to a full return of sports rights cost in 2021 and the delayed start to the current NBA season, pushing Lakers games from 2020 into 2021. Cost to service customers will also increase as transaction activity rises despite less net adds, as I mentioned.
We're also providing an additional outsized raise to our hourly employees as we nearly closed the gap to a $20 minimum hourly wage. And as non-pay churn returns to normal levels, but we'll also see a onetime step-up in bad debt expense also returning to normal levels.
With all that in mind, we expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth to be good, but lower than in 2020, primarily driven by the net effects of COVID, including related wage increases, higher programming and RSN costs, normalized bad debt, and the lack of political advertising in 2021.
So while we still expect 2021 to be a good year, 2022 should be even stronger. Assuming our 2021 Internet net adds are similar to 2019, and the economy returns to normal. Our momentum in 2022 will be very strong. SMB and enterprise revenue growth rate should be back to our expectations. Core advertising should return to full growth, and 2022 should be a strong non presidential political advertising year. We won't face the same onetime step-up and return to normal programming and sports rights cost. We'll be past the large onetime step-up in our hourly wages that will occur in 2021. And we also won't have the same onetime step-up in customer transactions and bad debt expense also in the cost to service customers line.
So while it's very early to get excited about 2022, given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, 2022 could be the year of the financial and operating performance that we originally expected for 2020.
So when we look back at 2020, we are pleased with 2.2 million Internet net additions, 10% EBITDA growth and our performance generally in what was a unique year. We're well positioned for 2021. And as a result of the consistency and customer-friendly nature of our operating model, we remain very optimistic about the medium and long-term growth prospects for Charter.

And then with the CBRS deployments kicking in, it sounds like from the pacing of CapEx that a lot of the deployment will happen, perhaps towards the end of 2020.

The continue",485,"So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were -- that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net additions relative to 2019. A political advertising year, which indeed we had. The continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened, some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult, put pressure on the financials, some of which was artificially good. And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we've had around political advertising. There's a lot of detail there, and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. And then when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have, depending how this year goes, as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost of service remain, in fact, have maybe been accelerated through COVID. We'll have another political advertising year in 2022. So I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out, given what uncertainty is still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year, and I think 2022 will be then even cleaner year really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multiyear operating model deployment.
The CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about the mobile CapEx for this year. I think it's going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI-based deployment of the radio access networks, it will really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost, and we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact, both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins and the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021."

I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and therefore, pushed net gain up forward. And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program. And therefore, there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales.
But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019.

And so the net of those 2 things is difficult to say, but I think we'll do better than the industry, in general, if you just look at multichannel video growth. Whether that will be positive or negative, I'm not sure."

We'd already retained them so they have stock. And so they didn't turn into a quarter growth sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced, and those 3 reasons are the big drivers and what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like to 2019."

Just some points of clarification around just the answer you just gave before. It sounds like all of the churn that you might have experienced from keeping America connected and other payment plans was sort of addressed prior to the fourth quarter. So the first question is, was there any residual churn from that customer base in the fourth quarter? Do you feel like you have just gotten to a normalized churn rate.
And then you talked about lower overall churn in the market. I was hoping to get your thoughts on that. Do you think this has to do with lockdowns or anything that was COVID related? And are you seeing so far this year, admittedly, early in this year, evidence that market behavior is returning to normal?"

The remote education offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisitions. So that had been the case earlier in the year, that continued to be the case through Q4. And for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently.
The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state. They've been paying and they've been retained as customers, and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher nonpay rate than your average customer base, you would expect that because of where they came from. But it's actually really good. And it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching those payment trends really since July or August when we started that program to reset the receivables. We don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers. They always were, and I think we did the right thing to put them back into the current receivable state.
The lower overall market churn, really the 2 big driver -- 3 drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall, people's account balances are high. They don't have places to spend money. And because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. Our payment profile for customers is good. It's better than it's ever been, and that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. So non-pay disconnect for the marketplaces are at record lows. Move to churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people are itching to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down across the market, we believe, as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers.
We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal is not by any means normal. And which is why I said our outlook for we on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook. And I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparison. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21, we'll look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity. And I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year."

First, I just want to step back from the broadband conversation for a moment. You've historically said that your preference is to keep prices low and to try to grow quickly, particularly when the opportunity for this kind of breakneck growth of 2020 was available. Is there any consideration now that growth is returning to a more normal pace that it might be time to perhaps be a little more reliant on price as most of the peers are in the industry in optimizing total revenue growth?
And then second was if I could return to the conversation on CBRS small sells, maybe we can just think about it in terms of an objective for how much traffic do you think you might be able to offload from the variabilized MVNO traffic to what you could eventually put over just the CBRS portion, not so much WiFi, but just the CBRS portion out-of-home?"

And I don't think any broadband provider in America connected has more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021, actually, because of the opportunity. And because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do data-only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020. And our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have, and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us.
With regard to CBRS, and how much traffic we can unload. I think that's a through-time kind of question. I think over the long haul, meaning 4, 5 years, it could be up to 1/3 of our traffic. That's current -- that would currently be on an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic. It depends on the traffic flows. It depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs. But it isn't necessary.
And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there's a mixture between Wi-Fi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works, that's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on Wifi. And as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company. If you really think about it, we have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool, along with WiFi, for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as a incremental opportunity from a return on investment point of view to move traffic onto our network. But it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy."

And Chris said earlier, you're not giving away free phones to get the wireless net adds. Is there a business model where at some point you -- it makes sense to do so. I would think from an MVNO standpoint, just selling in discounted service into new broadband subs, runs out of gas at some penetration level. It might last quite a while, and it might be a profitable business for you. But is -- I don't know if the updated MVNO with Verizon puts you in a position with different economics if offloading third year wireless traffic puts you in different economics. Is there a point where you can get more aggressive going after customers relative to what the big fee are doing. And then separately, I saw your marketing spend was up 1%, but the connects were down, and you indicated the 4Q environment was still pretty light.

And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can avoid it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide. Today, the 80% of traffic, mobile traffic that's already curative or our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection, a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration.
Today, our goal is not to use. We think there's so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have. There's not a need to go subsidize the handset. The headsets are -- have a longer life now than they have in the past. So we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. And we don't think that in and of itself is a great business model.
The marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter just because sales were lower doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continue to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connects inside the quarter.

I don't know that it's going to be that material this year anyway in any event to be at the back end of this year. As you look out and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There's pushes between different years in 2020 and we delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high-traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect.
So there will be, over time, things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track.

The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide, and our robust network handled an immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and telehealth services. 
Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at Charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016, and it showed up in our 2020 performance.
For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5%. And we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%. 
Our residential business performed particularly well, with strength in Internet, and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business, given the quality and value of our product.
Despite the outsized growth and some pull forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward, our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet adds that we achieved in 2019. And we believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced.
COVID-19 hurt our small business and enterprise businesses, but trends in those parts of our businesses are improving, and we're on our way back to our previous growth rates or better. Our core ad business also suffered, but it's now bouncing back, and core advertising is 95% of what we would have expected from a revenue perspective. We anticipate our advertising business will make a full recovery, with the timing of that recovery dependent on the full recovery of the economy.
2020 also resulted in the acceleration of efficiency in our core operations. Our self-installation program expanded dramatically from about 50% of sales before the pandemic to a new steady state of over 80% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2020, driving cost savings and improving customer satisfaction. We saw a significant increase in the use of our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, which drives cost savings and higher customer satisfaction. 
As we reflect on our 2020 operating performance, we also demonstrated our commitment to our customers, the communities we serve and our employees. We launched a number of community programs, including a remote education offer and the Keep America Connected pledge. In addition, we significantly expanded our Spectrum News coverage areas and opened up our Spectrum News websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information. We rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video customers.
For our employees, we offered additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer call center employees. Our efforts have been recognized by our employees, the local communities and customers we serve and related stakeholders, which brings long-term benefits.
Looking forward, we remain committed to offering a $20 minimum wage and our strategy of employing an in-sourced U.S.-based workforce that offers a long-term career path for our employees. And our call centers and all of our employees are now 100% U.S.-based. Our plans to expand our footprint in rural areas will increase broadband access and help connect well over 1 million homes, which have gone unserved until now. And that doesn't even include our regular build-out to lower density areas, which accelerated in 2020. 
We continue to offer our Spectrum Internet Assist program to millions of lower-income households at affordable prices. And as we look forward to the rest of 2021, we remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality services and products under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. Over the coming months, we plan to add multiple streaming video applications to our deployed WorldBoxes, and all incremental video connections, making it easier for our video customers to access today's most popular streaming content through one device.
Our Internet product also continues to improve. During the fourth quarter, we expanded the delivery of our minimum speed offerings of 200 megabits from about 60% of our footprint to close to 75% of our footprint. In the near term, we have a large opportunity to improve data throughput and latency on our network by using our DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still offers us a long runway to improve our product set. We'll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors and the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality down the road. We're also improving the quality of our WiFi routers and WiFi reception in the home. We recently launched our new WiFi 6 router in our first market, and we will have WiFi 6 router available in nearly all markets by mid-2021. And we now offer companion WiFi pods to improve WiFi reception in the home. 
Our advanced in-home WiFi service, which is a managed WiFi service that provides customers the ability to optimize their networks while providing greater control of their connected devices, has now been launched across more than 65% of our footprint for new connects. And we will continue to expand that footprint this year. 
And our mobile service now offers free access to nationwide 5G service. We recently spent $465 million to purchase 210 CBRS Priority Access Licenses. We intend to use those licenses, along with significant unlicensed CBRS spectrum on a targeted 5G small cell site strategy, with our HFC network providing power and backhaul. Those small cells, combined with improving WiFi capabilities, enable better throughput while driving significantly better economics for Charter. 
This year, we'll focus on scaling our systems to actively manage traffic on handsets using our MVNO, WiFi, CBRS spectrum. We will also build some targeted 5G small cell sites, which will help us learn how to pace our purely return-on-investment-based CBRS deployment. 
In closing, as we look back on 2020, we're very pleased with our performance as it demonstrates that our operating strategy works well for Charter communities, employees and shareholders even in challenging economic and operating environments. And despite the onetime impacts to our P&L, which Chris will cover, we ended the year well ahead of where we expected from a customer growth perspective, providing a higher level of subscription-based revenue and underlying EBITDA than what we would have expected.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,699344234,2185887,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief re",1666,"Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter, and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, set up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022.
Looking at Slide 6, including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down 93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter, because our first 3 quarters of this year were above last year's first 3 quarters by 900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by 2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis. 
The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to Charter earlier in the year, plus lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities, drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Trends have been improving more recently, and subject to COVID and economic developments, we currently expect full year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019.
Residential and SMB video customers declined by 35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by 56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by 103,000 in the quarter and by 148,000 for the full year. Mobile line net adds grew by 315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels, and the lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely, and we're not giving away free handsets to do it. For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines, and we believe we were the fastest-growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6%, excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3%, excluding political. Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that we're no longer isolating cable-specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, but we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021. 
A few comments on the most notable fourth quarter expense items, including certain COVID-related expense impacts during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 on Slide 9. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses declined by 10.7%, primarily driven by NBA games pushed into 2021. Cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year, driven by 6.5% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year and COVID flex time benefits to employees. That was partly offset by lower bad debt, which is due to better payment trends during COVID. 
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in net income attributable to charter shareholders. And as shown on Slide 11, our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion, including just over $500 million in mobile as we continue to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage, and we haven't slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas.
We continued to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and equipment upgrades and saw a high attach rate for our advanced in-home WiFi service. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar or lower than in 2020. We're still in the RDOF quiet period, and we'll isolate those effects for investors in the future.
We expect our 2021 mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2020 levels as we build out more mobile stores than we originally anticipated. And we will spend some dollars to scale our CBRS efforts in mobile back-office systems. Leaving aside the pace of ROI-based deployment of small cells, we would expect mobile CapEx for stores and systems to be materially lower in '22 and beyond.
We generated $7.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow in 2020, up 53% from 2019. Currently, we don't expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022.
For the full year 2020, we repurchased 21 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, approximately 7% of our shares and units for $12.1 billion. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased nearly $40 billion of stock or approximately 32% of our shares and units at an average price of $394 per share. 
Let me now focus on how 2020 sets up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Last year's customer growth was extraordinary, and we saw a significant demand for our products early on. Across the existing base and those newly acquired customers, we had record low churn of all types through the remainder of the year, which also reduced sales opportunities in the market in the second half. As Tom mentioned, we added nearly 2 million customer relationships compared to 1.1 million in 2019, and we added 2.2 million broadband customers compared to 1.4 million in 2019. And yet, total transaction activity in 2020, which is the sum of gross connects and churn, was actually lower than in 2019, driven by very low churn during the pandemic. 
Last year's financial activity was also unique. From a revenue perspective, 2020 was pressured by the sale of NaviSite in 2019 and COVID-related reductions for the Keep Americans Connected program and sports programming credits earlier in the year.
From a cost perspective, we saw savings in a number of areas. In programming, the interruption and cancellation of sporting events drove $163 million of sports cost savings. Similarly, the cancellation and shift of games also drove cost reductions and timing benefits of over $200 million in our regulatory, connectivity and produced content line related to our Lakers and Dodgers RSNs. 
Cost to service customers benefited from lower customer transactions and historically low bad debt, but that was more than offset by wage increases and COVID flex time we provided to our employees. In total, 2020 adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.9%.
For 2021, our baseline assumption is that the COVID-19 vaccine will be widely dispensed and that the economy will return to normal activity by the middle of this year. But the reality is that we don't know. But that assumption suggests that the full year 2021 customer net adds should look more like full year 2019 net adds with a return to more normal churn levels, driving higher transaction activity, including higher connect activity than in 2020 despite lower net adds. 
Not only were quarterly net add growth comparisons to 2020 be somewhat irrelevant but the current environment will drive abnormal variances when comparing individual quarters to 2019. And our underlying 2021 financial performance will be difficult to discern without the use of our 2020 COVID schedules shown on Slide 9 and on a quarterly basis, again on Slide 19.
From a financial perspective, we expect 2021 revenue growth to benefit from the significant customer growth we had in 2020, the lack of COVID-related credits in '21 and an improving SMB, core advertising and enterprise outlook, partly offset by the absence of political advertising revenue in 2021, all of which means we'll see significant year-over-year growth rate swings between quarters. From a cost perspective, we expect 2021 programming to grow at a higher rate than last year, in part because we don't expect last year's sports programming credits to recur.
Regulatory connectivity and produced content will also face a onetime step-up due to a full return of sports rights cost in 2021 and the delayed start to the current NBA season, pushing Lakers games from 2020 into 2021. Cost to service customers will also increase as transaction activity rises despite less net adds, as I mentioned. We're also providing an additional outsized raise to our hourly employees as we nearly closed the gap to a $20 minimum hourly wage. And as nonpay churn returns to normal levels, we'll also see a onetime step-up in bad debt expense also returning to normal levels.
With all that in mind, we expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth to be good, but lower than in 2020, primarily driven by the net effects of COVID, including related wage increases, higher programming and RSN costs, normalized bad debt, and the lack of political advertising in 2021.
So while we still expect 2021 to be a good year, 2022 should be even stronger. Assuming our 2021 Internet net adds are similar to 2019, and the economy returns to normal, our momentum in 2022 will be very strong. SMB and enterprise revenue growth rate should be back to our expectations. Core advertising should return to full growth, and 2022 should be a strong non-presidential political advertising year. We won't face the same onetime step-up and return to normal programming and sports rights cost. We'll be past the large onetime step-up in our hourly wages that will occur in 2021. And we also won't have the same onetime step-up in customer transactions and bad debt expense also in the cost to service customers line. So while it's very early to get excited about 2022, given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, 2022 could be the year of the financial and operating performance that we originally expected for 2020.
So when we look back at 2020, we are pleased with 2.2 million Internet net additions, 10% EBITDA growth and our performance generally in what was a unique year. We're well positioned for 2021. And as a result of the consistency and customer-friendly nature of our operating model, we remain very optimistic about the medium and long-term growth prospects for Charter.

First, you finished off by saying that 2022 could be the year you deliver the performance you expected in 2020. Can you remind us what you're anticipating in 2020 in terms of financial performance?
And then with the CBRS deployments kicking in, it sounds like from the pacing of CapEx that a lot of the deployment will happen perhaps towards the end of 2020. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins -- sorry, the deployment will happen towards the end of 2021. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins in 2022?

Well, the trends were -- that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net additions relative to 2019, a political advertising year, which indeed we had. The continue",485,"So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were -- that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net additions relative to 2019, a political advertising year, which indeed we had. The continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened, some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult, put pressure on the financials, some of which was artificially good. 
And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we've had around political advertising, there's a lot of detail there, and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. 
And then when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have, depending how this year goes, as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost of service remain, in fact, have maybe been accelerated through COVID. We'll have another political advertising year in 2022. 
And so I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out, given what uncertainties still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year, and I think 2022 will be an even cleaner year, really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multiyear operating model deployment.
The CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about, the mobile CapEx for this year. I think it's going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. 
As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI-based deployment of the radio access networks, it will really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost. And we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact, both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins. And the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021."

I would just add to that, that the returns on CBRS deployment after 2021, really, mostly, will be specific to the demand utilization in the location where the radios are placed. And so to some -- in a complete sense, it's an opportunistic strategy. Wherever our cost would be lower by investing in more CBRS radio deployment, our costs will go down in such a way that we'll get a return on investment.
And I guess just to sort of fill out Chris' response on trends. If you think about the long-run trend that we've been on of an accelerating growth rate in terms of broadband growth, that trend is still in place, and it exists for '19, '20, '21, and we think as well into 2022. And what's really happened is you've got a lot of noise in the '20 and '21 P&Ls. But the net of it, all of it is, if you spread it out over a multiyear period is that the trend continues, but we have 800,000 more Internet customers than we would have otherwise."

And how much of that sort of 600,000, I think, cohort is still sort of in the system and needs to be sort of cleansed out. Any thoughts on that?
And then obviously, your video subs in 2020 were pretty good. And I think you sort of used some of your flex on your carriage minimums on your low-tier offers. Can you just talk about -- is that a trend we should continue to see in '21? Or are we sort of saturated that opportunity given how much you've done on those lower-tier video?"

I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and, therefore, pushed net gain up forward. 
And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program. And therefore, there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales.
But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019. And we see that already in our performance so far through -- through the date of today in 2021."

And that macro trend hasn't gone away. And I expect, in general, video growth for the industry will continue to decline maybe at a moderate pace. And I don't think we'll have quite the Internet growth that we had in 2020 and 2021. So I think that just that fact alone is going to put more pressure on our video growth going forward. 
But on the other hand, we've been able to grow with OTT products and smaller packages. And we still have opportunities there, and we're forecasting our internal growth in those areas to continue to accelerate.

But to just list them out, the Q4 impacts for broadband and relationships: one, there's some pull forward of sales that we've talked about earlier in the year; two, there was less market churn that drives lower sales funnel, particularly for a share taker like us, that has an impact; and three, the nuance that Tom was going through is that the Keep Americans Connected customers meant we kept those subs already in Q2 and Q3, which was helpful to our net adds. 
But subs that might have turned around and reconnected in Q4 as a sale opportunity, we'd already retained them, so they've stuck. And so they didn't turn into a quarter growth sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced, and those 3 reasons are the big drivers and what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like to 2019."

Just some points of clarification around just the answer you just gave before. It sounds like all of the churn that you might have experienced from Keeping America Connected and other payment plans was sort of addressed prior to the fourth quarter. So the first question is, was there any residual churn from that customer base in the fourth quarter? Or do you feel like you have just gotten to a normalized churn rate?
And then you talked about lower overall churn in the market. I was hoping to get your thoughts on that. Do you think this has to do with lockdowns or anything that was COVID-related? And are you seeing so far this year, admittedly, early in this year, evidence that market behavior is returning to normal?"

The remote education offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisitions. So that had been the case earlier in the year. That continued to be the case through Q4. And for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently.
The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state, they've been paying and they've been retained as customers, and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher nonpay rate than your average customer base. You would expect that because of where they came from. But it's actually really good, and it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. 
So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching those payment trends really since July or August when we started that program to reset the receivables, we don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers. They always were, and I think we did the right thing to put them back into current receivable state.
The lower overall market churn, really the 2 big driver -- 3 drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall, people's account balances are high, they don't have places to spend money, and because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. Our payment profile for customers is good. It's better than it's ever been, and that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. 
So nonpay disconnect for the marketplace is at record lows. Mover churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people aren't itching to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down and across the market, we believe, as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers.
We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal. It is not by any means normal. And which is why I said our outlook for 2021 on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook. And I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparisons. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21 will look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity. And I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year."

First, I just want to step back from the broadband conversation for a moment. You've historically said that your preference is to keep prices low and to try to grow quickly, particularly when the opportunity for this kind of breakneck growth of 2020 was available. Is there any consideration now that growth is returning to a more normal pace that it might be time to perhaps be a little more reliant on price as most of the peers are in the industry in optimizing total revenue growth?
And then second was if I could return to the conversation on CBRS small cells, maybe we can just think about it in terms of an objective for how much traffic do you think you might be able to offload from the variabilized MVNO traffic to what you could eventually put over, just the CBRS portion, not so much WiFi, but just the CBRS portion out-of-home?"

And I don't think any broadband provider in America connected -- had more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. 
And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021, actually, because of the opportunity, and because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do a data-only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020. And our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have, and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us.
With regard to CBRS and how much traffic we can unload, I think that's a through-time kind of question. I think over the long haul, meaning 4, 5 years, it could be up to 1/3 of our traffic. That's current -- that would currently be on an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic. It depends on the traffic flows. It depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs. But it isn't necessary.
And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there's a mixture between WiFi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works, that's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on WiFi. And as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company, if you really think about it. We have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool, along with WiFi, for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as a incremental opportunity from a return-on-investment point of view to move traffic onto our network. But it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy."

And Chris said earlier, you're not giving away free phones to get the wireless net adds. Is there a business model where at some point you -- it makes sense to do so? I would think from an MVNO standpoint, just selling in discounted service into new broadband subs runs out of gas at some penetration level. It might last quite a while, and it might be a profitable business for you. But is -- I don't know if the updated MVNO with Verizon puts you in a position with different economics, if offloading through your wireless traffic puts you in different economics. Is there a point where you can get more aggressive going after customers relative to what the big 3 are doing. 
And then separately, I saw your marketing spend was up 1%, but the connects were down, and you indicated the 4Q environment was still pretty light. If you could just talk about your marketing strategy and how that might evolve in 2021, that would be helpful."

And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can avoid it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide. Today, the 80% of traffic, mobile traffic that's already carried over our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection, a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration.
Today, our goal is not to use -- we think there's so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have, there's not a need to go subsidize the handset. The headsets are -- have a longer life now than they have in the past, so we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. And we don't think that in and of itself is a great business model.
The marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter just because sales were lower doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continued to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connects inside the quarter."

On the other hand, not sure given the amount of planning work and what we'll need to stand up this year. I don't know that it's going to be that material this year. Anyway, in any event, it would be at the back end of this year. As you look out and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There's pushes between different years in 2020, and we delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high-traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect.
So there will be, over time, things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track. But the reality is core cable capital intensity as a percentage of revenue, the trend is on the decline, and nothing's really changed.

The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide, and our robust network handled an immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and telehealth services. 
Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at Charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016, and it showed up in our 2020 performance.
For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5%. And we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%. 
Our residential business performed particularly well, with strength in Internet, and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business, given the quality and value of our product.
Despite the outsized growth and some pull forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward, our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet adds that we achieved in 2019. And we believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced.
COVID-19 hurt our small business and enterprise businesses, but trends in those parts of our businesses are improving, and we're on our way back to our previous growth rates or better. Our core ad business also suffered, but it's now bouncing back, and core advertising is 95% of what we would have expected from a revenue perspective. We anticipate our advertising business will make a full recovery, with the timing of that recovery dependent on the full recovery of the economy.
2020 also resulted in the acceleration of efficiency in our core operations. Our self-installation program expanded dramatically from about 50% of sales before the pandemic to a new steady state of over 80% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2020, driving cost savings and improving customer satisfaction. We saw a significant increase in the use of our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, which drives cost savings and higher customer satisfaction. 
As we reflect on our 2020 operating performance, we also demonstrated our commitment to our customers, the communities we serve and our employees. We launched a number of community programs, including a remote education offer and the Keep America Connected pledge. In addition, we significantly expanded our Spectrum News coverage areas and opened up our Spectrum News websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information. We rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video customers.
For our employees, we offered additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer call center employees. Our efforts have been recognized by our employees, the local communities and customers we serve and related stakeholders, which brings long-term benefits.
Looking forward, we remain committed to offering a $20 minimum wage and our strategy of employing an in-sourced U.S.-based workforce that offers a long-term career path for our employees. And our call centers and all of our employees are now 100% U.S.-based. Our plans to expand our footprint in rural areas will increase broadband access and help connect well over 1 million homes, which have gone unserved until now. And that doesn't even include our regular build-out to lower density areas, which accelerated in 2020. 
We continue to offer our Spectrum Internet Assist program to millions of lower-income households at affordable prices. And as we look forward to the rest of 2021, we remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality services and products under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. Over the coming months, we plan to add multiple streaming video applications to our deployed WorldBoxes, and all incremental video connections, making it easier for our video customers to access today's most popular streaming content through one device.
Our Internet product also continues to improve. During the fourth quarter, we expanded the delivery of our minimum speed offerings of 200 megabits from about 60% of our footprint to close to 75% of our footprint. In the near term, we have a large opportunity to improve data throughput and latency on our network by using our DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still offers us a long runway to improve our product set. We'll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors and the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality down the road. We're also improving the quality of our WiFi routers and WiFi reception in the home. We recently launched our new WiFi 6 router in our first market, and we will have WiFi 6 router available in nearly all markets by mid-2021. And we now offer companion WiFi pods to improve WiFi reception in the home. 
Our advanced in-home WiFi service, which is a managed WiFi service that provides customers the ability to optimize their networks while providing greater control of their connected devices, has now been launched across more than 65% of our footprint for new connects. And we will continue to expand that footprint this year. 
And our mobile service now offers free access to nationwide 5G service. We recently spent $465 million to purchase 210 CBRS Priority Access Licenses. We intend to use those licenses, along with significant unlicensed CBRS spectrum on a targeted 5G small cell site strategy, with our HFC network providing power and backhaul. Those small cells, combined with improving WiFi capabilities, enable better throughput while driving significantly better economics for Charter. 
This year, we'll focus on scaling our systems to actively manage traffic on handsets using our MVNO, WiFi, CBRS spectrum. We will also build some targeted 5G small cell sites, which will help us learn how to pace our purely return-on-investment-based CBRS deployment. 
In closing, as we look back on 2020, we're very pleased with our performance as it demonstrates that our operating strategy works well for Charter communities, employees and shareholders even in challenging economic and operating environments. And despite the onetime impacts to our P&L, which Chris will cover, we ended the year well ahead of where we expected from a customer growth perspective, providing a higher level of subscription-based revenue and underlying EBITDA than what we would have expected.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,699344234,2253187,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief re",1666,"Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter, and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, set up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022.
Looking at Slide 6, including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down 93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter, because our first 3 quarters of this year were above last year's first 3 quarters by 900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by 2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis. 
The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to Charter earlier in the year, plus lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities, drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Trends have been improving more recently, and subject to COVID and economic developments, we currently expect full year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019.
Residential and SMB video customers declined by 35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by 56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by 103,000 in the quarter and by 148,000 for the full year. Mobile line net adds grew by 315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels, and the lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely, and we're not giving away free handsets to do it. For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines, and we believe we were the fastest-growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6%, excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3%, excluding political. Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that we're no longer isolating cable-specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, but we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021. 
A few comments on the most notable fourth quarter expense items, including certain COVID-related expense impacts during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 on Slide 9. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses declined by 10.7%, primarily driven by NBA games pushed into 2021. Cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year, driven by 6.5% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year and COVID flex time benefits to employees. That was partly offset by lower bad debt, which is due to better payment trends during COVID. 
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in net income attributable to charter shareholders. And as shown on Slide 11, our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion, including just over $500 million in mobile as we continue to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage, and we haven't slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas.
We continued to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and equipment upgrades and saw a high attach rate for our advanced in-home WiFi service. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar or lower than in 2020. We're still in the RDOF quiet period, and we'll isolate those effects for investors in the future.
We expect our 2021 mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2020 levels as we build out more mobile stores than we originally anticipated. And we will spend some dollars to scale our CBRS efforts in mobile back-office systems. Leaving aside the pace of ROI-based deployment of small cells, we would expect mobile CapEx for stores and systems to be materially lower in '22 and beyond.
We generated $7.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow in 2020, up 53% from 2019. Currently, we don't expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022.
For the full year 2020, we repurchased 21 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, approximately 7% of our shares and units for $12.1 billion. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased nearly $40 billion of stock or approximately 32% of our shares and units at an average price of $394 per share. 
Let me now focus on how 2020 sets up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Last year's customer growth was extraordinary, and we saw a significant demand for our products early on. Across the existing base and those newly acquired customers, we had record low churn of all types through the remainder of the year, which also reduced sales opportunities in the market in the second half. As Tom mentioned, we added nearly 2 million customer relationships compared to 1.1 million in 2019, and we added 2.2 million broadband customers compared to 1.4 million in 2019. And yet, total transaction activity in 2020, which is the sum of gross connects and churn, was actually lower than in 2019, driven by very low churn during the pandemic. 
Last year's financial activity was also unique. From a revenue perspective, 2020 was pressured by the sale of NaviSite in 2019 and COVID-related reductions for the Keep Americans Connected program and sports programming credits earlier in the year.
From a cost perspective, we saw savings in a number of areas. In programming, the interruption and cancellation of sporting events drove $163 million of sports cost savings. Similarly, the cancellation and shift of games also drove cost reductions and timing benefits of over $200 million in our regulatory, connectivity and produced content line related to our Lakers and Dodgers RSNs. 
Cost to service customers benefited from lower customer transactions and historically low bad debt, but that was more than offset by wage increases and COVID flex time we provided to our employees. In total, 2020 adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.9%.
For 2021, our baseline assumption is that the COVID-19 vaccine will be widely dispensed and that the economy will return to normal activity by the middle of this year. But the reality is that we don't know. But that assumption suggests that the full year 2021 customer net adds should look more like full year 2019 net adds with a return to more normal churn levels, driving higher transaction activity, including higher connect activity than in 2020 despite lower net adds. 
Not only were quarterly net add growth comparisons to 2020 be somewhat irrelevant but the current environment will drive abnormal variances when comparing individual quarters to 2019. And our underlying 2021 financial performance will be difficult to discern without the use of our 2020 COVID schedules shown on Slide 9 and on a quarterly basis, again on Slide 19.
From a financial perspective, we expect 2021 revenue growth to benefit from the significant customer growth we had in 2020, the lack of COVID-related credits in '21 and an improving SMB, core advertising and enterprise outlook, partly offset by the absence of political advertising revenue in 2021, all of which means we'll see significant year-over-year growth rate swings between quarters. From a cost perspective, we expect 2021 programming to grow at a higher rate than last year, in part because we don't expect last year's sports programming credits to recur.
Regulatory connectivity and produced content will also face a onetime step-up due to a full return of sports rights cost in 2021 and the delayed start to the current NBA season, pushing Lakers games from 2020 into 2021. Cost to service customers will also increase as transaction activity rises despite less net adds, as I mentioned. We're also providing an additional outsized raise to our hourly employees as we nearly closed the gap to a $20 minimum hourly wage. And as nonpay churn returns to normal levels, we'll also see a onetime step-up in bad debt expense also returning to normal levels.
With all that in mind, we expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth to be good, but lower than in 2020, primarily driven by the net effects of COVID, including related wage increases, higher programming and RSN costs, normalized bad debt, and the lack of political advertising in 2021.
So while we still expect 2021 to be a good year, 2022 should be even stronger. Assuming our 2021 Internet net adds are similar to 2019, and the economy returns to normal, our momentum in 2022 will be very strong. SMB and enterprise revenue growth rate should be back to our expectations. Core advertising should return to full growth, and 2022 should be a strong non-presidential political advertising year. We won't face the same onetime step-up and return to normal programming and sports rights cost. We'll be past the large onetime step-up in our hourly wages that will occur in 2021. And we also won't have the same onetime step-up in customer transactions and bad debt expense also in the cost to service customers line. So while it's very early to get excited about 2022, given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, 2022 could be the year of the financial and operating performance that we originally expected for 2020.
So when we look back at 2020, we are pleased with 2.2 million Internet net additions, 10% EBITDA growth and our performance generally in what was a unique year. We're well positioned for 2021. And as a result of the consistency and customer-friendly nature of our operating model, we remain very optimistic about the medium and long-term growth prospects for Charter.

And then with the CBRS deployments kicking in, it sounds like from the pacing of CapEx that a lot of the deployment will happen perhaps towards the end of 2020. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins -- sorry, the deployment will happen towards the end of 2021. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins in 2022?

The continue",485,"So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were -- that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net additions relative to 2019, a political advertising year, which indeed we had. The continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened, some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult, put pressure on the financials, some of which was artificially good. 
And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we've had around political advertising, there's a lot of detail there, and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. 
And then when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have, depending how this year goes, as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost of service remain, in fact, have maybe been accelerated through COVID. We'll have another political advertising year in 2022. 
And so I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out, given what uncertainties still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year, and I think 2022 will be an even cleaner year, really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multiyear operating model deployment.
The CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about, the mobile CapEx for this year. I think it's going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. 
As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI-based deployment of the radio access networks, it will really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost. And we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact, both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins. And the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021."

I would just add to that, that the returns on CBRS deployment after 2021, really, mostly, will be specific to the demand utilization in the location where the radios are placed. And so to some -- in a complete sense, it's an opportunistic strategy. Wherever our cost would be lower by investing in more CBRS radio deployment, our costs will go down in such a way that we'll get a return on investment.
And I guess just to sort of fill out Chris' response on trends. If you think about the long-run trend that we've been on of an accelerating growth rate in terms of broadband growth, that trend is still in place, and it exists for '19, '20, '21, and we think as well into 2022. And what's really happened is you've got a lot of noise in the '20 and '21 P&Ls. But the net of it, all of it is, if you spread it out over a multiyear period is that the trend continues, but we have 800,000 more Internet customers than we would have otherwise."

And how much of that sort of 600,000, I think, cohort is still sort of in the system and needs to be sort of cleansed out. Any thoughts on that?
And then obviously, your video subs in 2020 were pretty good. And I think you sort of used some of your flex on your carriage minimums on your low-tier offers. Can you just talk about -- is that a trend we should continue to see in '21? Or are we sort of saturated that opportunity given how much you've done on those lower-tier video?"

I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and, therefore, pushed net gain up forward. 
And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program. And therefore, there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales.
But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019.

We had good results in video for 2 reasons: One, we had outsized growth in connectivity. And as a result of that, by having market share shift to us from other video providers as they bought our broadband, we grew our video against a macro trend of declining multichannel video growth. And that macro trend hasn't gone away. And I expect, in general, video growth for the industry will continue to decline maybe at a moderate pace. And I don't think we'll have quite the Internet growth that we had in 2020 and 2021. So I think that just that fact alone is going to put more pressure on our video growth going forward.

And we still have opportunities there, and we're forecasting our internal growth in those areas to continue to accelerate. And so the net of those 2 things is difficult to say, but I think we'll do better than the industry, in general, if you just look at multichannel video growth. Whether that will be positive or negative, I'm not sure."

But to just list them out, the Q4 impacts for broadband and relationships: one, there's some pull forward of sales that we've talked about earlier in the year; two, there was less market churn that drives lower sales funnel, particularly for a share taker like us, that has an impact; and three, the nuance that Tom was going through is that the Keep Americans Connected customers meant we kept those subs already in Q2 and Q3, which was helpful to our net adds. 
But subs that might have turned around and reconnected in Q4 as a sale opportunity, we'd already retained them, so they've stuck. And so they didn't turn into a quarter growth sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced, and those 3 reasons are the big drivers and what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like to 2019."

Just some points of clarification around just the answer you just gave before. It sounds like all of the churn that you might have experienced from Keeping America Connected and other payment plans was sort of addressed prior to the fourth quarter. So the first question is, was there any residual churn from that customer base in the fourth quarter? Or do you feel like you have just gotten to a normalized churn rate?
And then you talked about lower overall churn in the market. I was hoping to get your thoughts on that. Do you think this has to do with lockdowns or anything that was COVID-related? And are you seeing so far this year, admittedly, early in this year, evidence that market behavior is returning to normal?"

The remote education offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisitions. So that had been the case earlier in the year. That continued to be the case through Q4. And for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently.
The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state, they've been paying and they've been retained as customers, and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher nonpay rate than your average customer base. You would expect that because of where they came from. But it's actually really good, and it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. 
So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching those payment trends really since July or August when we started that program to reset the receivables, we don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers. They always were, and I think we did the right thing to put them back into current receivable state.
The lower overall market churn, really the 2 big driver -- 3 drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall, people's account balances are high, they don't have places to spend money, and because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. Our payment profile for customers is good. It's better than it's ever been, and that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. 
So nonpay disconnect for the marketplace is at record lows. Mover churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people aren't itching to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down and across the market, we believe, as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers.
We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal. It is not by any means normal. And which is why I said our outlook for 2021 on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook. And I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparisons. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21 will look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity. And I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year."

First, I just want to step back from the broadband conversation for a moment. You've historically said that your preference is to keep prices low and to try to grow quickly, particularly when the opportunity for this kind of breakneck growth of 2020 was available. Is there any consideration now that growth is returning to a more normal pace that it might be time to perhaps be a little more reliant on price as most of the peers are in the industry in optimizing total revenue growth?
And then second was if I could return to the conversation on CBRS small cells, maybe we can just think about it in terms of an objective for how much traffic do you think you might be able to offload from the variabilized MVNO traffic to what you could eventually put over, just the CBRS portion, not so much WiFi, but just the CBRS portion out-of-home?"

And I don't think any broadband provider in America connected -- had more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. 
And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021, actually, because of the opportunity, and because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do a data-only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020. And our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have, and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us.
With regard to CBRS and how much traffic we can unload, I think that's a through-time kind of question. I think over the long haul, meaning 4, 5 years, it could be up to 1/3 of our traffic. That's current -- that would currently be on an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic. It depends on the traffic flows. It depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs. But it isn't necessary.
And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there's a mixture between WiFi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works, that's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on WiFi. And as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company, if you really think about it. We have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool, along with WiFi, for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as a incremental opportunity from a return-on-investment point of view to move traffic onto our network. But it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy."

And Chris said earlier, you're not giving away free phones to get the wireless net adds. Is there a business model where at some point you -- it makes sense to do so? I would think from an MVNO standpoint, just selling in discounted service into new broadband subs runs out of gas at some penetration level. It might last quite a while, and it might be a profitable business for you. But is -- I don't know if the updated MVNO with Verizon puts you in a position with different economics, if offloading through your wireless traffic puts you in different economics. Is there a point where you can get more aggressive going after customers relative to what the big 3 are doing. 
And then separately, I saw your marketing spend was up 1%, but the connects were down, and you indicated the 4Q environment was still pretty light. If you could just talk about your marketing strategy and how that might evolve in 2021, that would be helpful."

And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can avoid it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide. Today, the 80% of traffic, mobile traffic that's already carried over our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection, a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration.
Today, our goal is not to use -- we think there's so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have, there's not a need to go subsidize the handset. The headsets are -- have a longer life now than they have in the past, so we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. And we don't think that in and of itself is a great business model.
The marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter just because sales were lower doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continued to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connects inside the quarter."

On the other hand, not sure given the amount of planning work and what we'll need to stand up this year. I don't know that it's going to be that material this year. Anyway, in any event, it would be at the back end of this year. As you look out and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There's pushes between different years in 2020, and we delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high-traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect.
So there will be, over time, things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track. But the reality is core cable capital intensity as a percentage of revenue, the trend is on the decline, and nothing's really changed.

The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide, and our robust network handled an immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and telehealth services. 
Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at Charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016, and it showed up in our 2020 performance.
For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5%. And we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%. 
Our residential business performed particularly well, with strength in Internet, and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business, given the quality and value of our product.
Despite the outsized growth and some pull forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward, our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet adds that we achieved in 2019. And we believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced.
COVID-19 hurt our small business and enterprise businesses, but trends in those parts of our businesses are improving, and we're on our way back to our previous growth rates or better. Our core ad business also suffered, but it's now bouncing back, and core advertising is 95% of what we would have expected from a revenue perspective. We anticipate our advertising business will make a full recovery, with the timing of that recovery dependent on the full recovery of the economy.
2020 also resulted in the acceleration of efficiency in our core operations. Our self-installation program expanded dramatically from about 50% of sales before the pandemic to a new steady state of over 80% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2020, driving cost savings and improving customer satisfaction. We saw a significant increase in the use of our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, which drives cost savings and higher customer satisfaction. 
As we reflect on our 2020 operating performance, we also demonstrated our commitment to our customers, the communities we serve and our employees. We launched a number of community programs, including a remote education offer and the Keep America Connected pledge. In addition, we significantly expanded our Spectrum News coverage areas and opened up our Spectrum News websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information. We rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video customers.
For our employees, we offered additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer call center employees. Our efforts have been recognized by our employees, the local communities and customers we serve and related stakeholders, which brings long-term benefits.
Looking forward, we remain committed to offering a $20 minimum wage and our strategy of employing an in-sourced U.S.-based workforce that offers a long-term career path for our employees. And our call centers and all of our employees are now 100% U.S.-based. Our plans to expand our footprint in rural areas will increase broadband access and help connect well over 1 million homes, which have gone unserved until now. And that doesn't even include our regular build-out to lower density areas, which accelerated in 2020. 
We continue to offer our Spectrum Internet Assist program to millions of lower-income households at affordable prices. And as we look forward to the rest of 2021, we remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality services and products under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. Over the coming months, we plan to add multiple streaming video applications to our deployed WorldBoxes, and all incremental video connections, making it easier for our video customers to access today's most popular streaming content through one device.
Our Internet product also continues to improve. During the fourth quarter, we expanded the delivery of our minimum speed offerings of 200 megabits from about 60% of our footprint to close to 75% of our footprint. In the near term, we have a large opportunity to improve data throughput and latency on our network by using our DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still offers us a long runway to improve our product set. We'll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors and the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality down the road. We're also improving the quality of our WiFi routers and WiFi reception in the home. We recently launched our new WiFi 6 router in our first market, and we will have WiFi 6 router available in nearly all markets by mid-2021. And we now offer companion WiFi pods to improve WiFi reception in the home. 
Our advanced in-home WiFi service, which is a managed WiFi service that provides customers the ability to optimize their networks while providing greater control of their connected devices, has now been launched across more than 65% of our footprint for new connects. And we will continue to expand that footprint this year. 
And our mobile service now offers free access to nationwide 5G service. We recently spent $465 million to purchase 210 CBRS Priority Access Licenses. We intend to use those licenses, along with significant unlicensed CBRS spectrum on a targeted 5G small cell site strategy, with our HFC network providing power and backhaul. Those small cells, combined with improving WiFi capabilities, enable better throughput while driving significantly better economics for Charter. 
This year, we'll focus on scaling our systems to actively manage traffic on handsets using our MVNO, WiFi, CBRS spectrum. We will also build some targeted 5G small cell sites, which will help us learn how to pace our purely return-on-investment-based CBRS deployment. 
In closing, as we look back on 2020, we're very pleased with our performance as it demonstrates that our operating strategy works well for Charter communities, employees and shareholders even in challenging economic and operating environments. And despite the onetime impacts to our P&L, which Chris will cover, we ended the year well ahead of where we expected from a customer growth perspective, providing a higher level of subscription-based revenue and underlying EBITDA than what we would have expected.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,699344234,2253189,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief re",1666,"Thanks, Tom. Due to the significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter, and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, set up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022.
Looking at Slide 6, including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down 93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter, because our first 3 quarters of this year were above last year's first 3 quarters by 900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by 2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis. 
The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to Charter earlier in the year, plus lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities, drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Trends have been improving more recently, and subject to COVID and economic developments, we currently expect full year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019.
Residential and SMB video customers declined by 35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by 56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by 103,000 in the quarter and by 148,000 for the full year. Mobile line net adds grew by 315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels, and the lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely, and we're not giving away free handsets to do it. For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines, and we believe we were the fastest-growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6%, excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3%, excluding political. Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that we're no longer isolating cable-specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, but we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021. 
A few comments on the most notable fourth quarter expense items, including certain COVID-related expense impacts during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 on Slide 9. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses declined by 10.7%, primarily driven by NBA games pushed into 2021. Cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year, driven by 6.5% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year and COVID flex time benefits to employees. That was partly offset by lower bad debt, which is due to better payment trends during COVID. 
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in net income attributable to charter shareholders. And as shown on Slide 11, our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion, including just over $500 million in mobile as we continue to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage, and we haven't slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas.
We continued to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and equipment upgrades and saw a high attach rate for our advanced in-home WiFi service. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar or lower than in 2020. We're still in the RDOF quiet period, and we'll isolate those effects for investors in the future.
We expect our 2021 mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2020 levels as we build out more mobile stores than we originally anticipated. And we will spend some dollars to scale our CBRS efforts in mobile back-office systems. Leaving aside the pace of ROI-based deployment of small cells, we would expect mobile CapEx for stores and systems to be materially lower in '22 and beyond.
We generated $7.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow in 2020, up 53% from 2019. Currently, we don't expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022.
For the full year 2020, we repurchased 21 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, approximately 7% of our shares and units for $12.1 billion. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased nearly $40 billion of stock or approximately 32% of our shares and units at an average price of $394 per share. 
Let me now focus on how 2020 sets up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Last year's customer growth was extraordinary, and we saw a significant demand for our products early on. Across the existing base and those newly acquired customers, we had record low churn of all types through the remainder of the year, which also reduced sales opportunities in the market in the second half. As Tom mentioned, we added nearly 2 million customer relationships compared to 1.1 million in 2019, and we added 2.2 million broadband customers compared to 1.4 million in 2019. And yet, total transaction activity in 2020, which is the sum of gross connects and churn, was actually lower than in 2019, driven by very low churn during the pandemic. 
Last year's financial activity was also unique. From a revenue perspective, 2020 was pressured by the sale of NaviSite in 2019 and COVID-related reductions for the Keep Americans Connected program and sports programming credits earlier in the year.
From a cost perspective, we saw savings in a number of areas. In programming, the interruption and cancellation of sporting events drove $163 million of sports cost savings. Similarly, the cancellation and shift of games also drove cost reductions and timing benefits of over $200 million in our regulatory, connectivity and produced content line related to our Lakers and Dodgers RSNs. 
Cost to service customers benefited from lower customer transactions and historically low bad debt, but that was more than offset by wage increases and COVID flex time we provided to our employees. In total, 2020 adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.9%.
For 2021, our baseline assumption is that the COVID-19 vaccine will be widely dispensed and that the economy will return to normal activity by the middle of this year. But the reality is that we don't know. But that assumption suggests that the full year 2021 customer net adds should look more like full year 2019 net adds with a return to more normal churn levels, driving higher transaction activity, including higher connect activity than in 2020 despite lower net adds. 
Not only were quarterly net add growth comparisons to 2020 be somewhat irrelevant but the current environment will drive abnormal variances when comparing individual quarters to 2019. And our underlying 2021 financial performance will be difficult to discern without the use of our 2020 COVID schedules shown on Slide 9 and on a quarterly basis, again on Slide 19.
From a financial perspective, we expect 2021 revenue growth to benefit from the significant customer growth we had in 2020, the lack of COVID-related credits in '21 and an improving SMB, core advertising and enterprise outlook, partly offset by the absence of political advertising revenue in 2021, all of which means we'll see significant year-over-year growth rate swings between quarters. From a cost perspective, we expect 2021 programming to grow at a higher rate than last year, in part because we don't expect last year's sports programming credits to recur.
Regulatory connectivity and produced content will also face a onetime step-up due to a full return of sports rights cost in 2021 and the delayed start to the current NBA season, pushing Lakers games from 2020 into 2021. Cost to service customers will also increase as transaction activity rises despite less net adds, as I mentioned. We're also providing an additional outsized raise to our hourly employees as we nearly closed the gap to a $20 minimum hourly wage. And as nonpay churn returns to normal levels, we'll also see a onetime step-up in bad debt expense also returning to normal levels.
With all that in mind, we expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth to be good, but lower than in 2020, primarily driven by the net effects of COVID, including related wage increases, higher programming and RSN costs, normalized bad debt, and the lack of political advertising in 2021.
So while we still expect 2021 to be a good year, 2022 should be even stronger. Assuming our 2021 Internet net adds are similar to 2019, and the economy returns to normal, our momentum in 2022 will be very strong. SMB and enterprise revenue growth rate should be back to our expectations. Core advertising should return to full growth, and 2022 should be a strong non-presidential political advertising year. We won't face the same onetime step-up and return to normal programming and sports rights cost. We'll be past the large onetime step-up in our hourly wages that will occur in 2021. And we also won't have the same onetime step-up in customer transactions and bad debt expense also in the cost to service customers line. So while it's very early to get excited about 2022, given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, 2022 could be the year of the financial and operating performance that we originally expected for 2020.
So when we look back at 2020, we are pleased with 2.2 million Internet net additions, 10% EBITDA growth and our performance generally in what was a unique year. We're well positioned for 2021. And as a result of the consistency and customer-friendly nature of our operating model, we remain very optimistic about the medium and long-term growth prospects for Charter.

And then with the CBRS deployments kicking in, it sounds like from the pacing of CapEx that a lot of the deployment will happen perhaps towards the end of 2020. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins -- sorry, the deployment will happen towards the end of 2021. How do you expect that to impact wireless margins in 2022?

The continue",485,"So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were -- that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net additions relative to 2019, a political advertising year, which indeed we had. The continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened, some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult, put pressure on the financials, some of which was artificially good. 
And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we've had around political advertising, there's a lot of detail there, and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. 
And then when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have, depending how this year goes, as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost of service remain, in fact, have maybe been accelerated through COVID. We'll have another political advertising year in 2022. 
And so I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out, given what uncertainties still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year, and I think 2022 will be an even cleaner year, really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multiyear operating model deployment.
The CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about, the mobile CapEx for this year. I think it's going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. 
As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI-based deployment of the radio access networks, it will really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost. And we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact, both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins. And the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021."

I would just add to that, that the returns on CBRS deployment after 2021, really, mostly, will be specific to the demand utilization in the location where the radios are placed. And so to some -- in a complete sense, it's an opportunistic strategy. Wherever our cost would be lower by investing in more CBRS radio deployment, our costs will go down in such a way that we'll get a return on investment.
And I guess just to sort of fill out Chris' response on trends. If you think about the long-run trend that we've been on of an accelerating growth rate in terms of broadband growth, that trend is still in place, and it exists for '19, '20, '21, and we think as well into 2022. And what's really happened is you've got a lot of noise in the '20 and '21 P&Ls. But the net of it, all of it is, if you spread it out over a multiyear period is that the trend continues, but we have 800,000 more Internet customers than we would have otherwise."

And how much of that sort of 600,000, I think, cohort is still sort of in the system and needs to be sort of cleansed out. Any thoughts on that?
And then obviously, your video subs in 2020 were pretty good. And I think you sort of used some of your flex on your carriage minimums on your low-tier offers. Can you just talk about -- is that a trend we should continue to see in '21? Or are we sort of saturated that opportunity given how much you've done on those lower-tier video?"

I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and, therefore, pushed net gain up forward. 
And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program. And therefore, there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales.
But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019.

And I don't think we'll have quite the Internet growth that we had in 2020 and 2021. So I think that just that fact alone is going to put more pressure on our video growth going forward. 
But on the other hand, we've been able to grow with OTT products and smaller packages. And we still have opportunities there, and we're forecasting our internal growth in those areas to continue to accelerate. And so the net of those 2 things is difficult to say, but I think we'll do better than the industry, in general, if you just look at multichannel video growth. Whether that will be positive or negative, I'm not sure."

But to just list them out, the Q4 impacts for broadband and relationships: one, there's some pull forward of sales that we've talked about earlier in the year; two, there was less market churn that drives lower sales funnel, particularly for a share taker like us, that has an impact; and three, the nuance that Tom was going through is that the Keep Americans Connected customers meant we kept those subs already in Q2 and Q3, which was helpful to our net adds. 
But subs that might have turned around and reconnected in Q4 as a sale opportunity, we'd already retained them, so they've stuck. And so they didn't turn into a quarter growth sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced, and those 3 reasons are the big drivers and what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like to 2019."

Just some points of clarification around just the answer you just gave before. It sounds like all of the churn that you might have experienced from Keeping America Connected and other payment plans was sort of addressed prior to the fourth quarter. So the first question is, was there any residual churn from that customer base in the fourth quarter? Or do you feel like you have just gotten to a normalized churn rate?
And then you talked about lower overall churn in the market. I was hoping to get your thoughts on that. Do you think this has to do with lockdowns or anything that was COVID-related? And are you seeing so far this year, admittedly, early in this year, evidence that market behavior is returning to normal?"

The remote education offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisitions. So that had been the case earlier in the year. That continued to be the case through Q4. And for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently.
The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state, they've been paying and they've been retained as customers, and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher nonpay rate than your average customer base. You would expect that because of where they came from. But it's actually really good, and it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. 
So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching those payment trends really since July or August when we started that program to reset the receivables, we don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers. They always were, and I think we did the right thing to put them back into current receivable state.
The lower overall market churn, really the 2 big driver -- 3 drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall, people's account balances are high, they don't have places to spend money, and because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. Our payment profile for customers is good. It's better than it's ever been, and that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. 
So nonpay disconnect for the marketplace is at record lows. Mover churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people aren't itching to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down and across the market, we believe, as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers.
We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal. It is not by any means normal. And which is why I said our outlook for 2021 on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook. And I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparisons. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21 will look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity. And I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year."

First, I just want to step back from the broadband conversation for a moment. You've historically said that your preference is to keep prices low and to try to grow quickly, particularly when the opportunity for this kind of breakneck growth of 2020 was available. Is there any consideration now that growth is returning to a more normal pace that it might be time to perhaps be a little more reliant on price as most of the peers are in the industry in optimizing total revenue growth?
And then second was if I could return to the conversation on CBRS small cells, maybe we can just think about it in terms of an objective for how much traffic do you think you might be able to offload from the variabilized MVNO traffic to what you could eventually put over, just the CBRS portion, not so much WiFi, but just the CBRS portion out-of-home?"

And I don't think any broadband provider in America connected -- had more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. 
And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021, actually, because of the opportunity, and because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do a data-only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020. And our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have, and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us.
With regard to CBRS and how much traffic we can unload, I think that's a through-time kind of question. I think over the long haul, meaning 4, 5 years, it could be up to 1/3 of our traffic. That's current -- that would currently be on an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic. It depends on the traffic flows. It depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs. But it isn't necessary.
And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there's a mixture between WiFi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works, that's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on WiFi. And as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company, if you really think about it. We have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool, along with WiFi, for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as a incremental opportunity from a return-on-investment point of view to move traffic onto our network. But it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy."

And Chris said earlier, you're not giving away free phones to get the wireless net adds. Is there a business model where at some point you -- it makes sense to do so? I would think from an MVNO standpoint, just selling in discounted service into new broadband subs runs out of gas at some penetration level. It might last quite a while, and it might be a profitable business for you. But is -- I don't know if the updated MVNO with Verizon puts you in a position with different economics, if offloading through your wireless traffic puts you in different economics. Is there a point where you can get more aggressive going after customers relative to what the big 3 are doing.

And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can avoid it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide. Today, the 80% of traffic, mobile traffic that's already carried over our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection, a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration.
Today, our goal is not to use -- we think there's so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have, there's not a need to go subsidize the handset. The headsets are -- have a longer life now than they have in the past, so we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. And we don't think that in and of itself is a great business model.
The marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter just because sales were lower doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continued to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connects inside the quarter."

Anyway, in any event, it would be at the back end of this year. As you look out and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There's pushes between different years in 2020, and we delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high-traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect.
So there will be, over time, things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track. But the reality is core cable capital intensity as a percentage of revenue, the trend is on the decline, and nothing's really changed.

We continue to execute well in the first quarter even in an environment with lower consumer move activity. We added over 300,000 customer relationships during the quarter with growth of 5.8% year-over-year. We also added 355,000 Internet c",886,"Thanks, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the first quarter even in an environment with lower consumer move activity. We added over 300,000 customer relationships during the quarter with growth of 5.8% year-over-year. We also added 355,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 2 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We added 300,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% and our free cash flow by nearly $500 million or 35%. 
COVID has continued to have an impact on our operations, but the economy as -- as the economy reopens and normal activities resume, we expect more sales opportunities to develop during the second half of the year. And we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers' EBITDA and free cash flow at healthy rates given the investments we've made in our network, which enable us to offer superior products and services. While the last year has focused on our successful operations and execution through the pandemic, May 18 will mark the fifth anniversary of the closing of our transaction to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Since then, we've added more than 7 million Internet customers, and our annual EBITDA has expanded from $13.6 billion to over $19 billion, and our enterprise value has increased by $100 billion. 
Since the start of 2016, we've invested over $40 billion in infrastructure and technology. And over the last 5 years, we've extended serviceability to approximately 5 million homes and businesses. We've also committed to extending our network to reach more rural areas. Over the next 6 years, we expect to spend at least $5 billion, offset by $1.2 billion in RDOF subsidies to reach over 1 million unserved consumer locations to gigabit Internet speeds. And we're actively exploring additional opportunities to further expand our rural build potential. Since our transactions closed, we've also enhanced the quality and efficiency of our operations. We've hired thousands of new employees into good jobs by bringing all of our work back to the U.S., and we committed to a minimum wage of $20 per hour to provide the best service possible, which fuels our growth. 
Since close, we prepared the launch of mobile broadband products at scale, and our customers now have the fastest and least expensive mobile and wireline broadband products available in the market. Importantly, we continue to improve our connectivity products as demand for data in the home continues to grow at a very rapid pace. During the first quarter, we continued to see significant growth in data usage per Internet customer. On average, non-video customers used about 700 gigabytes per month in the first part of the quarter. And for the full quarter, average usage by non-video customers was up nearly 20% year-over-year. 
Close to 20% of our nontraditional video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth in IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the growing number of IP devices connected to our network, which now totals nearly 450 million devices, and new and emerging products and services that are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning for telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats, for example. 
We're continuously increasing the capacity in our core hubs and augmenting our network to improve speed and performance at a pace dictated by customers in the marketplace. We have a cost-effective approach to using DOCSIS 3.1, which we've already deployed, to expand our network capacity 1.2 gigahertz, which gives us the ability to offer multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and at least 1 gigabit per second in the upstream. In addition, we have DOCSIS 4.0 and other emerging technologies to cost efficiently offer multi-gigabit speeds in both the downstream and in the upstream, serving heavy data usage needs of our customers with quality connectivity services. While we have a great network asset, which is fully deployed and has a capitally efficient path to deliver even higher capabilities, our strategy is founded on saving customers' money while providing state-of-the-art products. 
Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package, which has delivered over a combination of mobile and fixed networks. Our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband, is low. And we remain very much underpenetrated relative to our long-term opportunity. An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors, with 2-plus lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband, spends approximately $200 a month on its telecom services. Today, Charter only generates $33 a passing and $65 a customer of that $200 of combined monthly spend on mobile and wireline broadband service. By choosing Charter as their full-service connectivity provider, customers can save hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. And so our goal is to do the same with mobile in our service area as we did with wireline voice, where we made charter the predominant wireline phone carrier by reducing consumer telephone bills by over 70%. Meaning Charter can grow for a long time because we remain underpenetrated and our growth will reduce customer costs. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,709594157,2264796,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

Before getting into the details of the quarter, a few comments regarding our outlook and reporting. On last quarter's conference call, I spent some time walking through the outlook for 2021, that commentary related to our customer and financial growth expectations given the difficult comparability to prior year results due to the effects of COVID in 2020. Those comments were intended to help investors update their models for 2021 and understand the backdrop for what should be a very good 2022. 
So while I won't repeat everything I said on the last earnings call, our outlook in general has not changed. 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021, where we expect Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. And we will continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year, and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation, to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. 
Secondly, bundle allocation rules as required by GAAP continue to have a significant impact on our residential Internet, video and voice product revenues. Because of the declining utility of individual product revenues to investors, it's likely that, at some point, will collapse all residential product revenues into 1 residential revenue line. 
Turning to our results on Slide 5. Customer activity levels in the marketplace, specifically move churn and nonpay churn, have still not returned to normal levels, which means, on the one hand, we benefit from the lower operating expense from reduced service transactions and significantly lower bad debt. But it also means there are fewer selling opportunities in the market generally. Those trends are on a slow path to normalization. 
Despite a lower sales environment, we continue to gain share across our footprint, and we remain the share leader in Internet in all of our markets regardless of competing infrastructure. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.7 million in the last 12 months and by 302,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 355,000 in the quarter and by 2 million or 7.3% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 138,000; wireline voice declined by 88,000; and we added 300,000 higher ARPU mobile lines. 
In residential Internet, we added a total of 334,000 customers in the quarter, lower than the 398,000 that we gained during a strong first quarter in 2019 for the reasons I mentioned. Our residential video customers declined by 156,000, consistent with the loss of 152,000 we saw in the first quarter of 2019. 
In wireline voice, we lost 102,000 residential customers in the quarter, also similar to the loss of 120,000 in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to mobile. We added 300,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 million mobile lines with a good mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. We continue to be pleased with the results and trajectory of Spectrum Mobile, with less EBITDA loss per line as the business scales to expected stand-alone profitability. 
Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.6 million or 5.8%. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.5% year-over-year, given the higher mix of nonvideo customers, higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base, lower pay-per-view and video-on-demand revenue and lower installation revenue given higher self-install rates. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. 
As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth. 
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.6%, a bit faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.5% year-over-year, also a bit better than last quarter and grew by 7.2%, excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 2.8% year-over-year. 
First quarter advertising revenue declined by 5.8% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Our nonpolitical revenue grew by 5.3% year-over-year, primarily due to some COVID impacts late last March and our growing advanced advertising capabilities. 
Other revenue declined by 2% year-over-year, driven by lower late fees, partly offset by higher RSN revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $492 million with $228 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 6.7% year-over-year. 
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $235 million or 3.2% year-over-year. Programming increased 3.3% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice Essentials and Screen, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the lower pay-per-view revenue I mentioned. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 8.9%, driven by more Laker games than normal this quarter, resulting from the delayed start to the NBA season, combined with fewer games in the prior year period when sports leagues played fewer games due to COVID. Excluding those sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 2.1% year-over-year. 
Cost to service customers declined by 2.4% year-over-year compared to 5.8% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by $100 million in lower bad debt, which continues to benefit from record payment trends similar to 2020, though our expectation remains that bad debt trends should normalize over the course of this year. 
On the other direction, we saw pressure from outsized hourly wage increases that we put through in March of last year and again in March of this year, which we've discussed previously and relate to our commitment to reach a $20 minimum starting wage in 2022. Excluding bad debt, cost of service customers grew by 3.2% year-over-year, including the minimum starting wage increase and reflecting the 5.8% relationship growth. 
Marketing and sales expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $572 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses declined by 5.5%, primarily driven by a nonrecurring adjustment to bonuses related to COVID. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.5% in the quarter. Excluding mobile and bad debt in both years, our EBITDA growth rate would have been 3.6 percentage points lower. 
Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $807 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $396 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $360 million year-over-year, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage, with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. We also spent more on line extensions due to continued network expansion, including to rural areas. This does not include any yard-off spend, which we will incur and start to disclose later this year. 
The cost of build-outs tends to be front-loaded with design, [ make-ready ] construction before passings are activated. So it will take well into next year before our construction cadence lets any cost per passing metric to be meaningful. 
We spent $112 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding any RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. 
As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $84.3 billion in debt principal. [ And ] current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in April is $4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares -- Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $627 per share. In September of 2016, we've repurchased $43 billion or 34% of Charter's equity at an average price of $408 per share. 
Turning to taxes on Slide 13. We don't anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash tax payer until 2022, and we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of this year. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 to 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA, less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense, multiplied by 23% to 25% with a tax rate in 2022 to be a bit lower than that range given some carryover tax attributes. That estimate includes partnership tax distributions to advance New house, which are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile. 
Our operating model of growing by saving customers' money. Our network capabilities now and in the future and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. And we expect our results to reflect a growing infrastructure asset with a lot of ancillary products to use for until on top of our core connectivity services with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax-advantaged levered equity returns.

So Doug, yes, I think that our opportunity over a multiyear period is significant.

And so we are moving to make sure that happens in terms of the way we position and sell our products and in terms of their -- both product attributes and the price that we charge. 
My -- the purpose of that exposition on how much telecom spin there is, is just to show that there's lots of runway in front of us and a significant market opportunity there for us to create value for Charter while, at the same time, creating value for consumers. 
In terms of convergence, we already are moving toward convergence in many ways. And we have owners' economics in many ways. And we also have a good relationship as an MVNO. The owners' economics we get are in the CBRS spectrum that we purchased and its deployment in the WiFi network that we've deployed and the traffic that we carry over it. And there's continued opportunities to take advantage of that in the near term and the long term to create additional value for our customers and for the company's cost structure."

But when you think about this in terms of project financing, these construction projects have a much higher cost per passing than what we've typically built, and they have a longer payback. But as a result of them being as expensive as they are, we have a real high confidence in our ability to penetrate these markets with a broadband service that's needed and desired. And so what that means is, together with low-risk assumptions on ARPU, you can have pretty high confidence in terms of what the financial model is going to look like both from a cost and revenue perspective over time. So I think I've mentioned in the past that we'd expect the payback -- the cash-from-cash payback for these type of projects to be double digits in terms of years, so over 10 years. But the IRR can be mid-teens. And so we think those attractive investment with a low risk in terms of our ability to achieve those types of returns. 
What we haven't factored into any of that is what does that open for additional building opportunities on the edge of those networks as well as some of these rural communities by having broadband can actually have more fill in or become more suburban like, which could open up opportunities, which aren't built into our model. We think it's consistent to build this way as part of our strategy, and we think it's the right thing to do for the extended communities that we serve. And we think it's attractive for shareholders as a way to continue to grow our broadband footprint over time. 
So another alternative way to think about it is when you think about those type of economics, it's actually not that different from cable M&A at a point in time where there just hasn't been unfortunately as much cable M&A that we would have liked to have done."

But basically, our view is that if you think about the way networks are used, and I said people are using 700 gigs a month in the presentation today and a lot of our customers are using over a terabyte per month, most of that is television being delivered through IP to households. And the actual upstream usage is quite sufficient for all the current uses that we have. So we don't have an immediate need to expand the capacity of the plant. And the plant is actually used in a very asymmetric way by the products that are currently on it. And we don't see that changing in the near term. But we do have the capability from a technical perspective to upgrade our network based on changing market dynamics, however they may develop in terms of how products develop. We don't see an immediate need to do that, but we do think our network from a competitive point of view is well positioned from a capital intensity perspective to make those upgrade costs at much lower cost than alternative means. And so we think that we're positioned to grow in the marketplace in a very efficient way and serve products that we need to serve up based on the way the market develops. But today, we should continue to operate our network with more capacity downstream than upstream."

It's normalizing slightly slower than what we would have expected or hoped for. Like I said in the prepared remarks, the benefit is that we have really significant EBITDA growth as a result of last year's subscriber growth and this year -- this quarter's subscriber growth, compounded by the lower level of activity in the marketplace, which is driving down transaction costs and churn and bad debt, which produces an outsized temporary financial result. 
Our preference would be to put a little bit of pressure on those financial results by increasing our sales and marketing through commissions and through normalizing the market through a higher level of move activity, which opens up additional selling opportunities for us as a share taker. It's a share-taker year. We'd like to be on the offensive [ than ] to acquire customers and save some money. And that opportunity is what contributes to net adds and what contributes to short-term financial pressure to have a higher long-term EBITDA and free cash flow. 
We have seen the market slowly coming back. And so it is moving in the right direction. It's just not moving as fast as some of us would like. That includes from move churn slight -- not as much on nonpay because of all the subsidy that's out there today, which is a different topic. I think it's going to start getting back to normal here pretty quick. A lot of us who have been in the office every day through the pandemic that we're just noting this morning that the pickup in traffic even in the New York and Connecticut area, it's pretty symbolic in terms.

I appreciate that moves creates a lot of jump balls for the company, but you only serve half the households in your footprint. The vast majority of those you don't serve, I think, are poorly served, and that's probably becoming increasingly apparent to them. Does the math on marketing dollars become more favorable, meaning looking to potentially force the issue a bit as opposed to just waiting for a natural shift in volumes in the market? 
And then also, I'm curious how significant is an assumption that, that sort of reverts to normalized levels in terms of thinking about the margin profile of the company this year? And the reason I ask is it would seem like all the things going on in the background are favorable to bad debt, whether it's an expectation that the economy is going to continue to recover and also just the government continuing to show a prioritization and making sure that people not only have access to good broadband but are able to sustain that access, including through additional subsidy programs. It all just seems to be moving in your favor from a bad debt standpoint."

And so you have to keep coming back and back and back. And as attractive as our products are and as much as we can save customers' money, it takes a while to prime loose, and it's disruptive to swap out one, if not all, of your services in the household. And despite the economics that we can provide and the better quality speeds and service, it just takes a little bit of time. But we're always looking for ways to be more aggressive.

And look, there's a bull case that the market could start to move and our selling opportunities could increase, which would drive higher commissions and transaction costs to acquire and provision and install these customers. And the bull case would be at the same time, we have that because the level of subsidy that is out in the marketplace and might continue that our bad debt could remain low, and it could actually open up. Those subsidies could open up portions of the market from an affordability standpoint that could drive more sales. And so could you end up with the best of the both worlds? Maybe, but that's not something that we're betting on. It's an environment we've never really seen before.

But the overall trajectory of our business, notwithstanding the current circumstances, which are really unprecedented, the fundamental cost to serve our customers continues to come down because of our digitization of the sales in marketing and service infrastructure of the company and our ability to do self-service and self-installation.

And then a second somewhat unrelated question, just if you could talk about the Business Services segment, perhaps, and that's still growing significantly more slowly than residential.

The repricing of the TWC base is essentially through for SMB. We have had some pressure recently through seasonality programs that we've offered to SMB customers through COVID that is winding down as well as the repricing being through. If you take a look at the unit growth on SMB, I think you can pretty quickly see a path for us to get revenue growth than SMB more closely aligned to the unit growth rate or the customer relationship growth rate. So I think the outlook on SMB from a revenue standpoint is positive. 
The same applies for enterprise. Enterprise is a slightly different set of circumstances. The retail revenue growth rate, like SMB, has been accelerating. And it's up sequentially, the same as SMB. It's now at 7.2% for the retail portion of revenue for enterprise. And it's being held back slightly by wholesale, particularly cell tower backhaul, where that's becoming a lesser and lesser portion of the overall revenue mix in enterprise. And the more strategic piece for us is retail in any event. 
The enterprise business is selling more, is doing extremely well, both certainly compared to last year, but also compared to 2019. And that's despite the fact that these are complex fiber products where today, less than 25% of the time, we're meeting our customers' CIOs in the office. So that's a difficult sell to make when you're not in person to have a complex fiber cell, whether it's for fiber Internet access, Ethernet, unified communications, SD-WAN, and yet our sales are increasing and accelerating despite the fact that we can't be on location to make those cells. So I'm optimistic about the enterprise retail side and what that's going to do for the overall revenue growth rate, not only for enterprise, but when you look at commercial combined together with SMB, which is also improving."

A lot of that's college and back-to-school driven as well as the new season of people repositioning. And if anything, one hand, I think it will be normal. On the other hand, you could argue that things really do get back to a fully normalized level. There may be a pent-up demand for that type of new activity. So I don't know. 
The 2 factors you mentioned, which could, around the edges, have an impact slightly, although I don't think it changes the overall curve, would be to the extent that subsidies and stimulus continue to drive down nonpay. And at the same time, we had an acceleration of move churn, which is a lot more selling opportunities, maybe that could have a positive impact. 
And the other one that you pointed out was the EBV program, which could have similar type of benefits both on the non-pay as well as on the activation side. But I don't think that fundamentally, the overall trend of Q2 compared to Q1 or Q3 or Q4 is going to be that much different. 
On CapEx, we slightly tweaked what we said from an outlook perspective. And it ties back to what I talked about with Ben in terms of the market is normalizing, but just at a slightly slower pace. But as that market has been -- remains slow to normalize, data usage remains high. And so that has an impact on the amount of headroom we planned for in terms of capacity and network augmentation. Now it's very much possible our core cable capital intensity declines this year. But given the uncertainty, we updated the outlook is likely to stay relatively consistent [ in quotes ] with last year.

I'm wondering what you'd be able to share from the conversations you've been having with the administration around their ambitions for $100 billion in infrastructure investment in broadband. Wondering how -- specifically how you guys see the opportunity to benefit from that if it were to come to pass? And where you see potential threats? 
And then separately, I just looked back at where voice penetration of broadband customers peaked, and it peaked at 50%. And that probably understates your market share because it peaked at the end of [ '15 ] when the market was already declining.

In terms of how we're communicating with regard to broadband buildout and subsidy and infrastructure subsidies, our view is that the job 1 is to get the unserved areas of the country served and that subsidies should be directed to do that. And we're willing to help and invest and to make that happen. And that the private capital that's been deployed in the United States in the communications networks, the capital that just got spent on Spectrum by the wireless companies and us and Comcast and the CBRS auction and the capital that's going into -- that has gone into and continues to go into the communications infrastructure in the country is good and held us in good stead in -- through the pandemic when we were able to operate networks at high capacity instantaneously, unlike Western Europe and other places where communication services and entertainment services were actually down rest.

Our goal is to drive as much growth as we can because we know what the underlying profitability is and what it does for the overall business. So I don't think we're going to be forecasting EBITDA breakeven on a consolidated wireless business basis, which is even how we look at the business because we think about it combined. 
And that being said, we have essentially the same economics as Comcast, and so the model is very similar. And -- but we are focused on really driving as much subscriber acquisition as we can. The business itself, absent any subscriber acquisition costs, so absent any marketing and sales, already cleared profitability absent growth cost at the 2 million lines mark. So we're well into that territory. So really, what you're looking at in terms of an EBITDA drag right now is really about new subscriber acquisition. And that's something, if we have the opportunity to push, we're going to go do that. And so I don't want to give necessarily a guidance or an outlook on that.

We continue to execute well in the first quarter, even in an environment with lower consumer move activity.

We continue to execute well in the first quarter, even in an environment with lower consumer move activity. We added over 300,000 customer relationships during the quarter, with growth of 5.8% year-over-year. We also added 355,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 2 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We added 300,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% and our free cash flow by nearly $500 million or 35%.  
COVID has continued to have an impact on our operations, but the economy as  -- as the economy reopens and normal activities resume, we expect more sales opportunities to develop during the second half of the year, and we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers' EBITDA and free cash flow at healthy rates given the investments we've made in our network, which enable us to offer superior products and services. 
While the last year has focused on our successful operations and execution through the pandemic, May 18 will mark the fifth anniversary of the closing of our transaction to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Since then, we've added more than 7 million Internet customers, and our annual EBITDA has expanded from $13.6 billion to over $19 billion, and our enterprise value has increased by $100 billion.  
Since the start of 2016, we've invested over $40 billion in infrastructure and technology. And over the last 5 years, we've extended serviceability to approximately 5 million homes and businesses. We've also committed to extending our network to reach more rural areas. 
Over the next 6 years, we expect to spend at least $5 billion, offset by $1.2 billion in RDOF subsidies to reach over 1 million unserved consumer locations with gigabit Internet speeds. And we're actively exploring additional opportunities to further expand our rural build potential. 
Since our transactions closed, we've also enhanced the quality and efficiency of our operations. We've hired thousands of new employees into good jobs by bringing all of our work back to the U.S., and we committed to a minimum wage of $20 per hour to provide the best service possible, which fuels our growth.  
Since close, we prepared the launch of mobile broadband products at scale, and our customers now have the fastest and least expensive mobile and wireline broadband products available in the market. Importantly, we continue to improve our connectivity products as demand for data in the home continues to grow at a very rapid pace. 
During the first quarter, we continued to see significant growth in data usage per Internet customer. On average, non-video customers used about 700 gigabytes per month in the first part of the quarter. And for the full quarter, average usage by non-video customers was up nearly 20% year-over-year.  
Close to 20% of our nontraditional video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth in IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the growing number of IP devices connected to our network, which now totals nearly 450 million devices, and new and emerging products and services that are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning for telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats, for example.  
We're continuously increasing the capacity in our core and hubs and augmenting our network to improve speed and performance at a pace dictated by customers in the marketplace. We have a cost-effective approach to using DOCSIS 3.1, which we've already deployed, to expand our network capacity at 1.2 gigahertz, which gives us the ability to offer multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and at least 1 gigabit per second in the upstream. 
In addition, we have DOCSIS 4.0 and other emerging technologies to cost efficiently offer multi-gigabit speeds in both the downstream and in the upstream, serving heavy data usage needs of our customers with quality connectivity services. 
While we have a great network asset, which is fully deployed and has a capitally efficient path to deliver even higher capabilities, our strategy is founded on saving customers' money, while providing state-of-the-art products. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package, which has delivered over a combination of mobile and fixed networks. 
Our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband, is low, and we remain very much underpenetrated relative to our long-term opportunity. An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors, with 2-plus lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband, spends approximately $200 a month on its telecom services. Today, Charter only generates $33 a passing and $65 a customer of that $200 of combined monthly spend on mobile and wireline broadband service. 
By choosing Charter as their full-service connectivity provider, customers can save hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. And so our goal is to do the same with mobile on our service area as we did with wireline voice, where we made Charter the predominant wireline phone carrier by reducing consumer telephone bills by over 70%, meaning Charter can grow for a long time because we remain underpenetrated and our growth will reduce customer costs.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,709594157,2264916,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

Before getting into the details of the quarter, a few comments regarding our outlook and reporting. 
On last quarter's conference call, I spent some time walking through the outlook for 2021, that commentary related to our customer and financial growth expectations given the difficult comparability to prior year results due to the effects of COVID in 2020. Those comments were intended to help investors update their models for 2021 and understand the backdrop for what should be a very good 2022.  
So while I won't repeat everything I said on the last earnings call, our outlook in general has not changed. 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021, where we expect Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. And we will continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons.  
Secondly, bundle allocation rules as required by GAAP continue to have a significant impact on our residential Internet, video and voice product revenues. Because of the declining utility of individual product revenues to investors, it's likely that, at some point, we'll collapse all residential product revenues into one residential revenue line.  
Turning to our results on Slide 5. Customer activity levels in the marketplace, specifically move churn and nonpay churn, have still not returned to normal levels, which means, on the one hand, we benefit from the lower operating expense from reduced service transactions and significantly lower bad debt, but it also means there are fewer selling opportunities in the market generally. Those trends are on a slow path to normalization.  
Despite a lower sales environment, we continue to gain share across our footprint, and we remain the share leader in Internet in all of our markets, regardless of competing infrastructure. 
We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.7 million in the last 12 months and by 302,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 355,000 in the quarter and by 2 million or 7.3% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 138,000; wireline voice declined by 88,000; and we added 300,000 higher ARPU mobile lines.  
In residential Internet, we added a total of 334,000 customers in the quarter, lower than the 398,000 that we gained during a strong first quarter in 2019 for the reasons I mentioned. Our residential video customers declined by 156,000, consistent with the loss of 152,000 we saw in the first quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 102,000 residential customers in the quarter, also similar to the loss of 120,000 in the first quarter of 2019.  
Turning to mobile. We added 300,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 million mobile lines with a good mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. We continue to be pleased with the results and trajectory of Spectrum Mobile, with less EBITDA loss per line as the business scales to expected standalone profitability.  
Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.6 million or 5.8%. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.5% year-over-year given a higher mix of nonvideo customers, higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base, lower pay-per-view and video-on-demand revenue and lower installation revenue given higher self-install rates. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue.  
As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth.  
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.6%, a bit faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.5% year-over-year, also a bit better than last quarter, and grew by 7.2%, excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 2.8% year-over-year.  
First quarter advertising revenue declined by 5.8% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Our nonpolitical revenue grew by 5.3% year-over-year primarily due to some COVID impacts late last March and our growing advanced advertising capabilities.  
Other revenue declined by 2% year-over-year driven by lower late fees, partly offset by higher RSN revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $492 million, with $228 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 6.7% year-over-year.  
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $235 million or 3.2% year-over-year. Programming increased 3.3% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the lower pay-per-view revenue I mentioned. 
Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 8.9% driven by more Laker games than normal this quarter, resulting from the delayed start to the NBA season, combined with fewer games in the prior year period when sports leagues played fewer games due to COVID. Excluding those sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 2.1% year-over-year.  
Cost to service customers declined by 2.4% year-over-year compared to 5.8% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by $100 million in lower bad debt, which continues to benefit from record payment trends similar to 2020, though our expectation remains that bad debt trends should normalize over the course of this year.  
On the other direction, we saw pressure from outsized hourly wage increases that we put through in March of last year and again in March of this year, which we've discussed previously and related to our commitment to reach a $20 minimum starting wage in 2022. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers grew by 3.2% year-over-year, including the minimum starting wage increase and reflecting the 5.8% relationship growth.
Marketing and sales expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $572 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses declined by 5.5% primarily driven by a nonrecurring adjustment to bonuses related to COVID.  
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.5% in the quarter. Excluding mobile and bad debt in both years, our EBITDA growth rate would have been 3.6 percentage points lower.  
Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $807 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $396 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA.  
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $360 million year-over-year, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage, with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. We also spent more on line extensions due to continued network expansion, including to rural areas. This does not include any RDOF spend, which we will incur and start to disclose later this year.  
The cost of build-outs tends to be front-loaded with design, make ready  and construction before passings are activated, so it will take well into next year before our construction cadence lets any cost per passing metric to be meaningful.  
We spent $112 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding any RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020.  
As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $84.3 billion in debt principal. With the current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in April is $4 billion. As of the end of this -- the first quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range.  
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares -- Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $627 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $43 billion or 34% of Charter's equity at an average price of $408 per share.  
Turning to taxes on Slide 13. We don't anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash tax payer until 2022, and we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of this year. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 to 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA, less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense, multiplied by 23% to 25%, with a tax rate in 2022 to be a bit lower than that range given some carryover tax attributes. 
That estimate includes partnership tax distributions to advance new house, which are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile.  
Our operating model of growing by saving customers' money, our network capabilities now and in the future and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. And we expect our results to reflect a growing infrastructure asset with a lot of ancillary products to use for until on top of our core connectivity services, with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax-advantaged levered equity returns.

My -- the purpose of that exposition on how much telecom spin there is, is just to show that there's lots of runway in front of us and a significant market opportunity there for us to create value for Charter while, at the same time, creating value for consumers.  
In terms of convergence, we already are moving toward convergence in many ways, and we have owners' economics in many ways. And we also have a good relationship as an MVNO. The owners' economics we get are in the CBRS spectrum that we purchased and its deployment, in the WiFi network that we've deployed and the traffic that we carry over it. And there's continued opportunities to take advantage of that in the near term and the long term to create additional value for our customers and for the company's cost structure."

But when you think about this in terms of project financing, these construction projects have a much higher cost per passing than what we've typically built, and they have a longer payback. But as a result of them being as expensive as they are, we have a real high confidence in our ability to penetrate these markets with a broadband service that's needed and desired. 
And so what that means is, together with low-risk assumptions on ARPU, you can have pretty high confidence in terms of what the financial model is going to look like, both from a cost and revenue perspective over time. So I think I've mentioned in the past that we'd expect the payback -- the cash-from-cash payback for these type of projects to be double digits in terms of years, so over 10 years, but the IRR can be mid-teens. And so we think those attractive investment with a low risk in terms of our ability to achieve those types of returns.  
What we haven't factored into any of that is what does that open for additional building opportunities on the edge of those networks as well as some of these rural communities by having broadband can actually have more fill in or become more suburban like, which could open up opportunities, which aren't built into our model. 
We think it's consistent to build this way as part of our strategy, and we think it's the right thing to do for the extended communities that we serve. And we think it's attractive for shareholders as a way to continue to grow our broadband footprint over time.  
So another alternative way to think about it is when you think about those type of economics, it's actually not that different from cable M&A at a point in time where there just hasn't been unfortunately as much cable M&A that we would have liked to have done."

But basically, our view is that if you think about the way networks are used, and I said people are using 700 gigs a month in the presentation today, and a lot of our customers are using over a terabyte per month, most of that is television being delivered through IP to households. And the actual upstream usage is quite sufficient for all the current uses that we have. 
So we don't have an immediate need to expand the capacity of the plant, and the plant is actually used in a very asymmetric way by the products that are currently on it. And we don't see that changing in the near term. But we do have the capability from a technical perspective to upgrade our network based on changing market dynamics, however they may develop in terms of how products develop. 
We don't see an immediate need to do that, but we do think our network from a competitive point of view is well positioned from a capital intensity perspective to make those upgrade costs at much lower cost than alternative means. And so we think that we're positioned to grow in the marketplace in a very efficient way and serve products that we need to serve up based on the way the market develops.

It's normalizing slightly slower than what we would have expected or hoped for. Like I said in the prepared remarks, the benefit is that we have really significant EBITDA growth as a result of last year's subscriber growth and this year -- this quarter's subscriber growth, compounded by the lower level of activity in the marketplace, which is driving down transaction costs and churn and bad debt, which produces an outsized temporary financial result.  
Our preference would be to put a little bit of pressure on those financial results by increasing our sales and marketing through commissions and through normalizing the market through a higher level of move activity, which opens up additional selling opportunities for us as a share taker. 
It's a share-taker year. We'd like to be on the offensive and to acquire customers and save them money, and that opportunity is what contributes to net adds and what contributes to short-term financial pressure to have a higher long-term EBITDA and free cash flow.  
We have seen the market slowly coming back, and so it is moving in the right direction. It's just not moving as fast as some of us would like. That includes from move churn slight -- not as much on nonpay because of all the subsidy that's out there today, which is a different topic. I think it's going to start getting back to normal here pretty quick. 
A lot of us who have been in the office every day through the pandemic that we're just noting this morning that the pickup in traffic, even in the New York and Connecticut area, it's pretty symbolic in terms.

I appreciate that moves creates a lot of jump balls for the company, but you only serve half the households in your footprint.

Does the math on marketing dollars become more favorable, meaning looking to potentially force the issue a bit as opposed to just waiting for a natural shift in volumes in the market?  
And then also, I'm curious how significant is an assumption that, that sort of reverts to normalized levels in terms of thinking about the margin profile of the company this year. And the reason I asked, it would seem like all the things going on in the background are favorable to bad debt, whether it's an expectation that the economy is going to continue to recover and also just the government continuing to show a prioritization and making sure that people not only have access to good broadband, but are able to sustain that access, including through additional subsidy programs.

The repricing of the TWC base is essentially through for SMB. We have had some pressure recently through seasonality programs that we've offered to SMB customers through COVID that is winding down as well as the repricing being through. 
If you take a look at the unit growth on SMB, I think you can pretty quickly see a path for us to get revenue growth on SMB more closely aligned to the unit growth rate or the customer relationship growth rate. So I think the outlook on SMB from a revenue standpoint is positive.  
The same applies for enterprise. Enterprise is a slightly different set of circumstances. The retail revenue growth rate, like SMB, has been accelerating. It's up sequentially, same as SMB. It's now at 7.2% for the retail portion of revenue for enterprise. And it's being held back slightly by wholesale, particularly cell tower backhaul, where that's becoming a lesser and lesser portion of the overall revenue mix in enterprise. And the more strategic piece for us is retail in any event.  
The enterprise business is selling more, is doing extremely well, both -- certainly compared to last year, but also compared to 2019, and that's despite the fact that these are complex fiber products where, today, less than 25% of the time, we're meeting our customers' CIOs in the office.

The 2 factors you mentioned, which could, around the edges, have an impact slightly, although I don't think it changes the overall curve, would be to the extent that the subsidies and stimulus continue to drive down nonpay, and at the same time, we had an acceleration of move churn, which is a lot more selling opportunities, maybe that could have a positive impact. 
And the other one that you pointed out was the EBB program, which could have similar type of benefits, both on the non-pay as well as on the activation side. But I don't think that, fundamentally, the overall trend of Q2 compared to Q1 or Q3 or Q4 is going to be that much different. 
On CapEx, we slightly tweaked what we said from an outlook perspective, and it ties back to what I talked about with Ben in terms of the market is normalizing, but just at a slightly slower pace. But as that market has been -- remains slow to normalize, data usage remains high. And so that has an impact on the amount of headroom we planned for in terms of capacity and network augmentation. 
Now it's very much possible, our core cable capital intensity declines this year. But given the uncertainty, we updated the outlook as likely to stay relatively ""consistent"" with last year. But I want to be clear, there's no change to our long-term outlook for core cable capital intensity to decline."

Our goal is to drive as much growth as we can because we know what the underlying profitability is and what it does for the overall business. 
So I don't think we're going to be forecasting EBITDA breakeven on a consolidated wireless business basis, which is even how we look at the business because we think about it combined. 
And that being said, we have essentially the same economics as Comcast, and so the model is very similar. And -- but we are focused on really driving as much subscriber acquisition as we can. The business itself, absent any subscriber acquisition costs, so absent any marketing and sales, already cleared profitability, absent growth cost at the 2 million lines mark. So we're well into that territory. 
So really, what you're looking at in terms of an EBITDA drag right now is really about new subscriber acquisition, and that's something, if we have the opportunity to push, we're going to go do that.

Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And becau",771,"Thank you, Stefan. Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And because churn continues to be so low, those trends are having a meaningful impact on our net additions and even larger impact on our financial growth rates. 
Our commercial business also saw improvements in the second quarter. Small business sales were up versus second quarter of 2019, and enterprise sales continue to steadily improve. Advertising also improved with second quarter revenue exceeding second quarter 2019 levels, driven by our advanced advertising products. So our view is the economy is improving, and our business trajectory is normalizing. 
For the full quarter, we added over 330,000 customer relationships with customer growth of 4.2% year-over-year. We also added 400,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.5 million over the last year for year-over-year growth of 5.5%. We added 265,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 11.8% and our free cash flow by over $2 million year-over-year. We remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality products and service under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. 
We've spoken significantly about wireless convergence in the capital-efficient nature of our expanding network capabilities and products. A key piece of our strategy also includes treating service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their spectrum services and interactions with us, whenever and however they want. We are improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing a number of elements our customers feel and network operations groups can use. Those efforts improve the customer experience and the quality of our products while reducing transactions with customers, lowering churn, extending average customer life and reducing costs. 
We've responded to digital and self-service trends in several ways. Today, over 20% of our residential relationship sales are generated through our online channel, with fully automated provisioning and installation scheduling and zero touch by Charter. And close to 85% of our sales take advantage of our self-installation program, reducing costs and driving higher customer satisfaction. 
Today, customers also choose the preferred scheme of interacting with us when they have questions or service issues, including digital chat, phone, online, in person at one of our stores or via the Spectrum app. 
Our ability to avoid and manage network impairments has improved significantly over the last several years by using machine learning to pinpoint potential service degradation in real time and often, in advance, allowing us to avoid disruption altogether. We're now coupling that information with customers' preferred communications to proactively notify them of maintenance and restoration. 
Today, over 60% of our customers engage with us exclusively via digital means when they have a service question or issue. Customers that still want to interact with us via phone can do so, and service from our call centers continues to become more efficient, given new tools we're deploying which enhance our ability to properly answer questions and solve the first -- for the first time, customer calls. And the fact that our call center workforce is U.S.-based and fully in-sourced, with employees who have training and career paths here at Charter, enhances that. 
In aggregate, all of our efforts have reduced total customer transactions, including billing and service calls, repeat service calls, truck rolls and [indiscernible], all of which improved the quality of our products. [indiscernible] yet we remain in the process of optimizing our services product. 
So together with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers' EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come. That confidence stems from a number of factors, including the demand for our connectivity products, including the long-term growth rate and usage on both wireline and wireless networks; our ability to deliver unique fully converged connectivity services -- connectivity activity service package while saving customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year; and our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still low. From a passings perspective, we remain underpenetrated to our long-term opportunity. 
Finally, our capital-efficient path to expand network capability and improve the quality of our products in a manner that's more capital efficient than our competitors gives us a structural advantage to compete over the long term. Ultimately, our strategy is founded on the principle of providing superior services at highly competitive prices. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,1673164178,2356473,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of t",1530,"Thanks, Tom. As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. 
Turning to our results on Slide 5. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 1.3 million in the last 12 months and by over 330,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 400,000 in the quarter by 1.5 million or 5.5% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 50,000 in the second quarter, and wireline voice declined by 78,000. 
In residential Internet, we added a total of 365,000 customers in the quarter, higher than the 221,000 that we gained during the second quarter of 2019. Our residential video customers declined by 63,000 less than the loss of 150,000 we saw in the second quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 99,000 residential customers in the quarter, also less than the loss of 207,000 in the second quarter of 2019, and that was driven by continued fixed to mobile substitution. 
Turning to mobile. We added 265,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. 
A few things to keep in mind when reviewing this quarter's customer results. First, we estimate that 60,000 of our residential Internet net adds would not have occurred without the emergency broadband benefit program, or EBD, which launched in May. These incremental Internet net adds had little impact on our video and voice net adds. Some of what we estimate as business-as-usual sales also enrolled in the [ EBB ] program, as did some of our existing customers. Those customers did not [ add to ] our second quarter customer net adds. 
Second quarter customer net adds also benefited from certain state-mandated moratoriums on Internet, video and voice disconnects. Internet benefited by about 40,000, with video and voice net additions also benefiting, but by loss. Some states have recently ended their moratoriums. So similar to our KAC customers last year, we will work with these customers to forgive portions of their bills and provide financing options to customers. And we expect to keep them as customers, same as we did with the KC program. 
Looking at the bigger picture. Residential customer activity levels in the marketplace, including sales, churn and particularly nonpay churn, are taking a bit longer than we expected to return to normal levels. As a result, our first half 2021 financials have been better than we expected, driven by lower operating expense given lower transactions, significantly lower bad debt. We continue to expect transaction volume to pick up in the second half of this year, driving more selling opportunities in the market for cable and mobile, and we still expect full year Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. So the financial effects that we expected of a higher churn environment and expected higher sales for Charter as a share taker could accrue later in 2021 or even into 2022. 
Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.2 million or 4.1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1.8% year-over-year [ due to ] second quarter rental revenue [indiscernible] $76 million for customers in the Keep Americans Connected program as well as bill credits that we provided last year as part of the remote education offer, which provided 2 months of free Internet. Those onetime comparison benefits were partly offset by the same bundle and mixed trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. 
Slide 6 shows residential revenue grew by 6.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts. 
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 6%, and this growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $17 million that negatively impacted the second quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.2%, faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 5.1% year-over-year and was also negatively impacted last year by $18 million due to COVID credits. Excluding this impact from last year, enterprise revenue grew by 2% and by 5.8%, when additionally excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 3.7% year-over-year. 
First quarter advertising revenue increased by 65% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID impact last year. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, advertising revenue grew by 4%, primarily due to our growing advertising -- advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by lower local add revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $519 million, with $214 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, second quarter revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year. 
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $575 million or 8% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 3.6% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as  Choice, Essentials and Stream. 
Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 36.9%, driven by more Lakers games than normal this quarter given the delayed start to the NBA season combined with no Lakers or Dodger games expensed in the prior year due to COVID-19. Excluding sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 3.2% year-over-year. 
Cost to service customers declined by 1.2% year-over-year compared to 4.2% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs and lower bad debt, partly driven by government stimulus packages. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers was flat year-over-year despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. 
Marketing expenses grew by 3.1% year-over-year, driven by second quarter 2020 COVID impacts, including lower media placement rates in 2020 and a payroll tax credit. Mobile devices totaled $586 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating cost. And other expenses grew by 13.5%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs and advertising sales expense given the strength of ad sales this quarter, combined with the weakness in the ad market in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.8% in the quarter. 
And turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $766 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter capital spend, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. This was offset by lower spend on modems, routers and self-installation kits given the elevated sales volume in the second quarter of last year. We spent $124 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, just mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. 
For full year 2021, we continue to expect cable [indiscernible] expenditures, excluding the RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. 
Slide 10 shows we generated nearly $2.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 10.8% year-over-year. We've finished the quarter with $87.5 million in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in July, is $4 billion, 4.0 to be exact. As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range. 
In June, we converted Advanced Newhouse's preferred partnership units, which had a face value of $2.5 billion and paid a 6% coupon. They were converted into 9.3 million common partnership units, which means we no longer pay $150 million in preferred dividends per year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $656 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $47 billion or 36% of Charter's equity at an average price of $421 per share. 
So we have a successful operating model and growth-oriented investment approach, which when coupled with the unique balance sheet structure and improving capital allocation strategy, has and will produce cash flow growth and shareholder value for years to come. 
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

First, with business services, I think you said last quarter, the repricing is now largely over for the Time Warner Cable customers. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in business services? It looks like with particularly weak results from Verizon and AT&T, that share gains may have meaningfully accelerated now in the wake of COVID. And then with CBRS and wireless, I wonder if you could just talk about how much traffic you think you can offload from the MVNO agreement. And what kind of time line do you think you'll be before you'll start to see those traffic reductions on your own network?"
19609,1673164178,2356473,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","So let me -- I'll start with business. and then I take Tom cover wireless.

So I'll start with what we're seeing in SMB and then with enterprise. 
And for SMB, as businesses recover, new businesses open and the share flow opportunity for us is growing, and you see us returning to higher growth rates. And at the same time, most of the repricing in the SMB space at the legacy TWC base is behind us with the exception of the voice product. So it's largely behind. So what you're seeing is accelerating net add growth accompanied by less price pressure, which is resulting in accelerating sequential revenue growth in SMB, and we're steadily marching down a path to continue to go higher on both. And I think the runway for us on SMB continues to be very long, even though we're -- we have a meaningful percentage and participation in that marketplace. 
On the enterprise side, we're lower penetrated, and our value-added opportunity is due to our significant amount of deployed fiber throughout our footprint to be able to drive connectivity services as well as software-defined network overlay products, including SD-WAN, unified communications. And so our opportunity there is not only to provide more fiber connectivity, but to establish ourselves in the marketplace for these additional services and increase the stickiness of our fiber connectivity with additional product. And we're early on in that. That marketplace had really slowed down significantly during COVID. And our selling activity is back [ and ] above 2019 levels despite the fact that certain key markets of ours, L.A., New York City, are not back to where they were. So despite that, we're above where we were in 2019, both from a revenue takeout on selling. 
What you're not seeing is that yet inside of our revenue for enterprise because a long time to installation and therefore, revenue continue to billing. So our outlook on that is pretty strong. It's going to continue slowly but continually get better and better in the enterprise space, but we're optimistic about both the SMB and enterprise. And I think we can be a share taker there for many years to come."

And Craig, with regard to CBRS and offload, we have our first infrastructure project that we're building that will use CBRS that won't be active until early next year. And I don't anticipate any meaningful national offload until beginning in '23. 
But that said, we see it as a long-term opportunity, and we're a nascent player in the mobile space and just beginning our acceleration. And we're incented to move significant amounts of traffic onto our own network, and we already do through our WiFi network, which we can also optimize for traffic flow going forward. And we can do the same with CBRS and potentially other parties as well. So we have an opportunity to continuously lower our cost going forward and to -- even if we were not using CBRS, we have an opportunity just through our volume activity to continue to move down the price curve. So we're optimistic about our ability to grow our mobile business and at the same time, take costs out of our mobile business as it grows. And there are a variety of tools, including CBRS, that allow us to do that. But I would say that without giving you an exact number, it would be material."

It's going be like you're going to flip the switch nationally, you'll start off market by market. And it's not going to be heavy inside of this year in any event. I don't think it's going to have any material impact to our CapEx this year. For a 5-, 6-year period, really what you would be doing is using high split to replace augmentation that you'd be doing otherwise to increase the capacity of our network. And so when you look at it over a 5- to 6-year time period, it would be at very low, if any, incremental cost. There may be pockets in that 5- to 6-year window where you'd be doing effectively capital pull forward. And I'd like to use the word lumpiness you might have in some of your capital expenditure. But we're going to do what's right. And if we can move fast and get additional augmentation and capacity, we'd do it, but I don't see a material impact this year and over a 5- to 6-year period. I don't think it changes the trajectory of our investment cycle. It give us additional capabilities, additional speeds at a lower cost than what we'd otherwise incur."

The big issue in general adoption is more of a digital literacy issue than it is a cost issue. And it's continuing to improve in terms of market adoption because of the way people can use the tools on the Internet today and I think -- and at any age. And I think you have a continuous march of a broadband adoption right up to occupied housing over the next 5 years. 
And so you have that and then you have our ability to have a superior service capitally efficient ability to continuously upgrade that service. And we think we can -- with a full range of products, including mobile and video, and we think we can continue to take share as a result of our ability to have high-quality, low-cost products available to consumers across the marketplace. 
With regard to video, why do we -- why our number is relatively better? We're selling more packages that allow us to tailor video to customer needs. It's a difficult business because in general, video is very expensive. Our cost for video to provide it to customers are very high and continuously going up. And so there's people being priced out of the market. We put lower-priced packages into the market. The new products that have been developed direct-to-consumer products are churning at higher levels. And so our products also are in that readoption process of -- that occurs as a result of churn. So to some extent, we think our video business is stabilizing, but at the other -- on the other hand, the fundamental trends haven't stopped, which is that prices are being continuously passed through to consumers, and there's real pressure on the total cost of the bundle. The reason we're relatively better as we have, we've been moderate with our pricing, and we've been moderate, and we've created new packages that cost less."

I'll take a crack at both of those, and then Tom may want to add additional. And on the wireless selling, so we're -- the answer is no, we're not going to give you the percentage of selling for obvious competitive reasons, but I can provide some color on it. We're essentially selling through all of our channels. It is a focus we have to make sure that on every conversation that we have inside of our selling channels that we're bringing up the conversation to how we can save customers money if they take mobile with us. Our sales success rate, our compliance for that conversation taking place and the sales success rate is going up. 
And what happened inside of Q2 and also inside of Q1 is we just have less selling opportunities, but our success rate in selling in is going up on the steady march across all of those channels, which includes retention, by the way. So in all of our sales channels, and we're using it as a retention tool as well. Customers call in and want to save money. This is a great way to save hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year for a customer by taking your mobile product. So it's working well, and we have a lot of confidence that it's going to keep on increasing. 
And as soon as the market flow opens back up in terms of selling opportunities, I think we're well positioned. And the Q3 [ band ], I don't expect EBB have any negative impact on us in Q3. The customers that were protected from the state mandate perspective, we've already -- inside of our Q2 results, it was small, but we've written off a portion of their balances. We're working with those customers. We've been successful in keeping those customers, those type of customers to the Keep Americans Connected programs. We'd want those customers to stay with us, and we're working with them to make sure that takes place. And it's worked in the past, and I don't expect any major impact there. 
I guess the only thing that I would say and -- well, 2 things I would say about Q3, and not so much even [ Q3 ] is just when you think about the coming quarters. Q2 2019 wasn't our strongest quarter. So we've really outpaced that this quarter versus 2019. And I think Q3 2019 was better than Q2 2019. So I'd just caution not to get over your SKUs on relative expansion of net adds and comparison to 2019. 
And there will be a moment where -- we were just talking about it yesterday. There will be a moment where there's dislocation where the market churn picks up, your sales should pick up. And so there's always this question of does the timing line up exactly right. As a share taker over a period of time, that means we're going to have higher sales. We're going to have higher net adds. But in order to get there, the market churn rate has to pick up. And there's a timing question of does it all flow through inside of the quarter the way they think it should. 
And so I -- what we always say, I wouldn't pay too much attention to a particular quarter. Our growth rate is good. It's going to continue to be good, and we tend to look over longer periods of time as opposed to just a particular quarter."

But the part of your question is, are we going",384,"On the margin, I think you know us well enough, John, that we don't think about the business in terms of percentage margin terms. It doesn't drive how we do investment planning or operating plans or budgets. But the part of your question is, are we going to continue to get more efficient? And the answer is yes. I mean, you have double-digit percentage increases in the number of trouble calls and service calls per customer relationship year-over-year. And that continues. It has a long runway. I think the bigger driver for consolidated margin really is much more about revenue mix. 
So if you think about what we're doing, we're adding mobile in, which has a positive EBITDA on the increment, but it has a lower structural percentage margin, if you think about it that way. We use video and mobile to drive higher attach rates for broadband, which is a high growth margin. We use it to drive higher retention of broadband. So we use lower stand-alone margin products to drive higher-margin acquisition and retention. And at the end of the day, that's not at all how we think about the mix. What we're thinking about is how can we create the most value in the household to drive the most products going in that gets the most EBITDA and the most cash flow per household. 
And so you could have a low revenue business with a high percentage margin and have this victory lap of high percentage margin, but you could have lower EBITDA and lower cash flow per household, and that's not the model that we deploy. So we're looking to put as much product in much value and to get as much EBITDA and cash flow out of the household by providing products that -- and packages that our customers can't replicate and make it easy to -- for customers to stay with us for a long period of time. 
So I don't want to give a guidance on where margin is going, other than it's going to be much more of a function of our lower video losses, continued growth in mobile, continued growth in Internet, which goes the opposite direction. But the biggest thing to focus on us is free cash flow and free cash flow per share."

And the cost commentary, if you go back after the call, take a look at the prepared remarks, what I was trying to make clear is as the -- as churn returns into the marketplace, that will give us better selling opportunities, which should ultimately lead to net adds. Some of that will be timing driven, but -- as I talked about earlier. But it's going to increase our sales commissions. It's going to increase the number of installations that we do, which has OpEx into, a lesser extent, CapEx. And it will increase the number of newer tenured customers who tend to call more frequently at the beginning. So operating cost and a higher transaction environment and higher churn environment move up. 
And in some sense, that's what we're hoping for is that we'll have OpEx pressure because our sales will be accelerating and our net adds would be higher, and it's not in the environment that we've been in the first half. And so we'll just do a good job of explaining that as it's taking place, but we've been trying to condition people from that environment since the beginning of the year, and it's happening later than we expected and may continue to push out. 
The other item that in the cost category of the bad debt, which goes along if you're nonpay. And it also attaches to -- it's driven as well by people just moving and term generally. 
And the CapEx is less impacted. From a volume standpoint, yes, you'll have a little bit more CP. You'll have a little bit more capitalized install, but it doesn't move around quite as rapidly in that environment as you'd see in OpEx. 
On share repurchase, we've been targeting a leverage to be at the mid- to high end of our target leverage range. And so the buybacks, we think about the long-term value of Charter, and we think it's high. And so really, when we look at buybacks, it's more about the target leverage range target as opposed to trying to be opportunistic for not day triggers. We have a good long-term view on the value of Charter. And so our buyback is much more enforced by the target leverage, target leverage where we expect to be at the end of the [ year ]."

The -- David Klein appreciates your complement to the industry-leading, I'm sure, Jessica. But the driver here is we've really had an enhanced ability to sell the long-tail inventory and be able to monetize what was previously not utilized. And we have a tool that's called Audience App. Because we have all of the set-top box data in an aggregated anonymized way for all of our customer base, we have the ability to present that to buyers of advertising and sell the long-tail inventory in a way that you were never able to do because Nielsen doesn't go very deep. And so we can sell that on a zone basis. We can sell it on a split-avail basis, addressable. And we can really effectively guarantee a buyer impressions across not just the traditional set-top box base, but clearly, through the increasing amount of IP-based viewing that we have off a Spectrum TV app, which is on Apple TV, Roku and Samsung TV and all these other devices, iOS devices, Android and really monetize those impressions and monetize the set-top box inventory in a very similar way. 
So I do think that we're leading the charge of moving the entire advertising space to an impression-based viewing and being able to show it to a buyer where across all of the different channels that they can get placement and to be able to validate and verify on the back end that those eyeballs were actually captured and that they had a good return. We've also been investing in addition to more forward thinking areas like addressability with buying split avails, which we have capabilities on, but also moving into using everything that I just described before, moving into attribution as well. And that's the Holy Grail here of being able to sell and then to go back and -- or take a lead to the customer what exactly it drove in terms of sales for them. 
So we have a fully -- full set of advertising capabilities that we offer to a client, super local when needed, addressable when needed. And we do it in traditional set-top box impression-based viewing and digital, which we sell as well. So despite the fact that the local ad sales market isn't all the way back, it's actually down relative to 2019. Certain segments like auto aren't performing as well because they don't have a lot of inventory. But despite that, our overall ad sales are up versus 2019, primarily driven by all the different capabilities that I described and the ability to make use of inventory that wasn't previously monetized."

Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And becau",775,"Thank you, Stefan. Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And because churn continues to be so low, those trends are having a meaningful impact on our net additions and even larger impact on our financial growth rates.
Our commercial business also saw improvements in the second quarter. Small business sales were up versus second quarter of 2019, and enterprise sales continued to steadily improve. Advertising also improved with second quarter revenue exceeding second quarter 2019 levels, driven by our advanced advertising products. So our view is the economy is improving, and our business trajectory is normalizing.
For the full quarter, we added over 330,000 customer relationships with a customer growth of 4.2% year-over-year. We also added 400,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.5 million over the last year for year-over-year growth of 5.5%. We added 265,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 11.8% and our free cash flow by over $200 million year-over-year. We remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high-quality products and service under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions.
We've spoken significantly about wireless convergence and the capital-efficient nature of our expanding network capabilities and products. The key piece of our strategy also includes treating service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their Spectrum services and interactions with us whenever and however they want. We are improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing a number of elements our customers feel that network operations groups can use. Those efforts improve the customer experience and the quality of our products while reducing transactions with customers, lowering churn, extending average customer life and reducing costs. 
We've responded to digital and self-service trends in several ways. Today, over 20% of our residential relationship sales are generated through our online channel, with fully automated provisioning and installation scheduling and zero touch by Charter. And close to 85% of our sales take advantage of our self-installation program, reducing costs and driving higher customer satisfaction. Today, customers also choose their preferred medium of interacting with us when they have questions or service issues, including digital chat, phone, online, in person at one of our stores or via the Spectrum app.
Our ability to avoid and manage network impairments has improved significantly over the last several years by using machine learning to pinpoint potential service degradation in real time and often, in advance, allowing us to avoid disruption altogether. We're now coupling that information with customers' preferred communications to proactively notify them of maintenance and restoration.
Today, over 60% of our customers engage with us exclusively via digital means when they have a service question or issue. Customers that still want to interact with us via phone can do so, and service from our call centers continues to become more efficient, given new tools we're deploying which enhance our ability to properly answer questions and solve the first -- for the first time, customer calls. And the fact that our call center workforce is U.S.-based and fully in-sourced with employees who have training and career paths here at Charter enhances that.
In aggregate, all of our efforts have reduced total customer transactions, including billing and service calls, repeat service calls, truck rolls and network impairments, all of which improved the quality of our products. We're executing well, yet we remain early in the process of optimizing our services product.
So together with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers, EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come. That confidence stems from a number of factors, including the demand for our connectivity products, including the long-term growth rate and usage on both wireline and wireless networks; our ability to deliver unique, fully converged connectivity services -- connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband, is still low. From a passings perspective, we remain underpenetrated to our long-term opportunity. 
Finally, our capital-efficient path to expand network capability and improve the quality of our products in a manner that's more capital efficient than our competitors gives us a structural advantage to compete over the long term. Ultimately, our strategy is founded on the principle of providing superior services at highly competitive prices.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."

As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of",1530,"Thanks, Tom. As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons.
Turning to our results on Slide 5. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 1.3 million in the last 12 months and by over 330,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 400,000 in the quarter and by 1.5 million or 5.5% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 50,000 in the second quarter, and wireline voice declined by 78,000.
In residential Internet, we added a total of 365,000 customers in the quarter, higher than the 221,000 that we gained during the second quarter of 2019. Our residential video customers declined by 63,000 less than the loss of 150,000 we saw in the second quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 99,000 residential customers in the quarter, also less than the loss of 207,000 in the second quarter of 2019, and that was driven by continued fixed to mobile substitution. 
Turning to mobile. We added 265,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. 
A few things to keep in mind when reviewing this quarter's customer results. First, we estimate that 60,000 of our residential Internet net adds would not have occurred without the Emergency Broadband Benefit program, or EBB, which launched in May. These incremental Internet net adds had little impact on our video and voice net adds. Some of what we estimate as business-as-usual sales also enrolled in the EBB program, as did some of our existing customers. Those customers did not impact our second quarter customer net adds. 
Second quarter customer net adds also benefited from certain state-mandated moratoriums on Internet, video and voice disconnects. Internet benefited by about 40,000, with video and voice net additions also benefiting, but by loss. Some states have recently ended their moratoriums. So similar to our KAC customers last year, we will work with these customers to forgive portions of their bills and provide financing options to customers. And we expect to keep them as customers, same as we did with the KAC program.
Looking at the bigger picture. Residential customer activity levels in the marketplace, including sales, churn and particularly nonpay churn, are taking a bit longer than we expected to return to normal levels. As a result, our first half 2021 financials have been better than we expected, driven by lower operating expense given lower transactions and significantly lower bad debt. We continue to expect transaction volume to pick up in the second half of this year, driving more selling opportunities in the market for cable and mobile, and we still expect full year Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. So the financial effects that we expected of a higher churn environment and expected higher sales for Charter as a share taker could accrue later in 2021 or even into 2022.
Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.2 million or 4.1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1.8% year-over-year given last year's second quarter residential revenue write-down of $76 million for customers in the Keep Americans Connected program as well as bill credits that we provided last year as part of the remote education offer, which provided 2 months of free Internet. Those onetime comparison benefits were partly offset by the same bundle and mixed trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base. 
Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. Slide 6 shows residential revenue grew by 6.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts.
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 6%, and this growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $17 million that negatively impacted the second quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.2%, faster than last quarter's growth. 
Enterprise revenue was up by 5.1% year-over-year and was also negatively impacted last year by $18 million due to COVID credits. Excluding this impact from last year, enterprise revenue grew by 2% and by 5.8% when additionally excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 3.7% year-over-year.
First quarter advertising revenue increased by 65% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID impact last year. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, advertising revenue grew by 4%, primarily due to our growing advertising -- advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by lower local ad revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $519 million, with $214 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, second quarter revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $575 million or 8% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 3.6% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream.
Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 36.9%, driven by more Lakers games than normal this quarter given the delayed start to the NBA season combined with no Lakers or Dodger games expensed in the prior year due to COVID-19. Excluding sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 3.2% year-over-year.
Cost to service customers declined by 1.2% year-over-year compared to 4.2% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs and lower bad debt, partly driven by government stimulus packages. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers was flat year-over-year despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year.
Marketing expenses grew by 3.1% year-over-year, driven by second quarter 2020 COVID impacts, including lower media placement rates in 2020 and a payroll tax credit. Mobile expenses totaled $586 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating cost. And other expenses grew by 13.5%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs and advertising sales expense given the strength of ad sales this quarter, combined with the weakness in the ad market in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.8% in the quarter.
And turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $766 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter capital spend, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. This was offset by lower spend on modems, routers and self-installation kits given the elevated sales volume in the second quarter of last year. 
We spent $124 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect cable capital expenditures, excluding the RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020.
As Slide 10 shows we generated nearly $2.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 10.8% year-over-year. We've finished the quarter with $87.5 million in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in July, is $4 billion, $4.0 billion to be exact. As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range.
In June, we converted Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units, which had a face value of $2.5 billion and paid a 6% coupon. They were converted into 9.3 million common partnership units, which means we no longer pay $150 million in preferred dividends per year.
During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $656 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $47 billion or 36% of Charter's equity at an average price of $421 per share. So we have a successful operating model and growth-oriented investment approach, which when coupled with the unique balance sheet structure and improving capital allocation strategy, has and will produce cash flow growth and shareholder value for years to come.

First, with business services, I think you said last quarter the repricing is now largely over for the Time Warner Cable customers. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in business services? It looks like with particularly weak results from Verizon and AT&T, that share gains may have meaningfully accelerated now in the wake of COVID. 
And then with CBRS and wireless, I wonder if you could just talk about how much traffic you think you can offload from the MVNO agreement. And what kind of time line do you think you'll be before you'll start to see those traffic reductions onto your own network?"

The -- on the business service segment, you have to really distinguish between SMB and enterprise. So I'll start with what we're seeing on SMB and then move to enterprise.
For SMB, as businesses recover, new businesses open, the share flow opportunity for us is growing, and you see us returning to higher growth rates. And at the same time, most of the repricing in the SMB space, with the legacy TWC base is behind us with the exception of the voice product. So it's largely behind. 
And so what you're seeing is accelerating net add growth accompanied by less price pressure, which is resulting in accelerating sequential revenue growth in SMB. And we're steadily marching down a path to continue to go higher on both. And I think the runway for us on SMB continues to be very long, even though we're -- we have a meaningful percentage and participation in that marketplace. 
On the enterprise side, we're lower penetrated, and our value-added opportunity is due to our significant amount of deployed fiber throughout our footprint to be able to drive connectivity services as well as software-defined network overlay products, including SD-WAN, unified communications. And so our opportunity there is not only to provide more fiber connectivity, but to establish ourselves in the marketplace for these additional services and increase the stickiness of our fiber connectivity with additional product. And we're early on in that. 
That marketplace had really slowed down significantly during COVID. And our selling activity is back and above 2019 levels despite the fact that certain key markets of ours, L.A., New York City, are not back to where they were. So despite that, we're above where we were in 2019, both from a units as well as a revenue takeout on selling. 
What you're not seeing is the full impact of that yet inside of our revenue for enterprise because those sales have long cycle times to installation and, therefore, revenue conversion into billing. So our outlook on that is pretty strong. It's going to continue slowly but continually get better and better in the enterprise space. So we're optimistic about both the SMB and enterprise. And I think we can be a share taker there for many years to come."

But that said, we think this is a long-term opportunity, and we're a nascent player in the mobile space and just beginning our acceleration. And we're incented to move significant amounts of traffic onto our own network, and we already do through our WiFi network, which we can also optimize for traffic flow going forward. And we can do the same with CBRS and potentially other parties as well. 
So we have an opportunity to continuously lower our cost going forward and to -- even if we were not using CBRS, we have an opportunity just through our volume of activity to continuously move down the price curve. So we're optimistic about our ability to grow our mobile business and at the same time, take costs out of our mobile business as it grows. And there are a variety of tools, including CBRS, that allow us to do that. But I would say that without giving you an exact number, it would be material."

It's not going to be like you're going to flip the switch nationally. You'll start off market by market. And it's not going to be heavy inside of this year in any event. So I don't think it's going to have any material impact to our CapEx this year. 
As you look out over a 5-, 6-year period, really what you would be doing is using high split to replace augmentation that you'd be doing otherwise to increase the capacity of our network. And so when you look at it over a 5- to 6-year time period, it would be at very low, if any, incremental cost. There may be pockets in that 5- to 6-year window where you'd be doing effectively capital pull forward. And I'd like to use the word lumpiness you might have in some of your capital expenditure. 
But we're going to do what's right. And if we can move fast and get additional augmentation and capacity, we'd do it, but I don't see a material impact this year. And over a 5- to 6-year period, I don't think it changes the trajectory of our investment cycle. It'd give us additional capabilities, additional speeds at a lower cost than what we'd otherwise incur."

And it's not the only tool in our toolbox.

The big issue in general adoption is more of a digital literacy issue than it is a cost issue. And it's continuing to improve in terms of market adoption because of the way people can use the tools on the Internet today at any level and at any age. And so I think you have a continuous march of broadband adoption right up to occupied housing over the next 5 years. 
And so you have that and then you have our ability to have a superior service with a capitally efficient ability to continuously upgrade that service. And we think we can -- with a full range of products, including mobile and video, and we think we can continue to take share as a result of our ability to have high-quality, low-cost products available to consumers across the marketplace.
With regard to video, why do we -- why our number is relatively better? We're selling more packages that allow us to tailor video to customer needs. It's a difficult business because in general, video is very expensive. Our cost for video to provide it to customers are very high and continuously going up. And so there's people being priced out of the market. We put lower-priced packages into the market. The new products that have been developed, direct-to-consumer products, are churning at higher levels. And so our products also are in that readoption process of -- that occurs as a result of churn. 
So to some extent, we think our video business is stabilizing, but at the other -- on the other hand, the fundamental trends haven't stopped, which is that prices are being continuously passed through to consumers, and there's real pressure on the total cost of the bundle. The reason we're relatively better is we have -- we've been moderate with our pricing, and we've been moderate -- and we've created new packages that cost less."

I'll take a crack at both of those, and then Tom may want to add additional. On the wireless sell-in, so we're -- the answer is no. We're not going to give you the percentage of sell-in for obvious competitive reasons, but I can provide some color on it. We're essentially selling through all of our channels. It is a focus we have to make sure that on every conversation that we have inside of our selling channels, that we're bringing up the conversation of how we can save customers money if they take mobile with us. Our sales success rate, our compliance for that conversation taking place and the sales success rate is going up.
And what happened inside of Q2 and also inside of Q1 is we just have less selling opportunities, but our success rate in selling in is going up on a steady march across all of those channels, which includes retention, by the way, so in all of our sales channels. And we're using it as a retention tool as well. Customers call in and want to save money. This is a great way to save hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year for a customer by taking our mobile product. So it's working well, and we have a lot of confidence that it's going to keep on increasing. And as soon as the market flow opens back up in terms of selling opportunities, I think we're well positioned. 
And the Q3 broadband, I don't expect EBB to have any negative impact on us in Q3. The customers that were protected from the state mandate perspective, we've already -- inside of our Q2 results, it was small, but we've written off a portion of their balances. We're working with those customers. We've been successful in keeping those customers, those type of customers through the Keep Americans Connected programs. We want those customers to stay with us, and we're working with them to make sure that takes place. And it's worked in the past, and I don't expect any major impact there.
I guess the only thing that I would say -- well, 2 things I would say about Q3, and not so much even Q3. It's just when you think about the coming quarters. Q2 2019 wasn't our strongest quarter. So we've really outpaced that this quarter versus 2019. And I think Q3 2019 was better than Q2 2019. So I'd just caution not to get over your skis on relative expansion of net adds in comparison to 2019. 
And there will be a moment where -- we were just talking about it yesterday. There will be a moment where there's dislocation where the market churn picks up, your sales should pick up. And so there's always this question of does the timing line up exactly right. As a share taker over a period of time, that means we're going to have higher sales. We're going to have higher net adds. But in order to get there, the market churn rate has to pick up. And there's a timing question of does it all flow through inside of the quarter the way you think it should. 
And so I -- what we always say, I wouldn't pay too much attention to a particular quarter. Our growth rate is good. It's going to continue to be good, and we tend to look over longer periods of time as opposed to just a particular quarter."

It doesn't drive how we do investment planning or operating plans or budgets. But the -- part of your question is, are we going to continue to get more efficient? And the answer is yes. I mean you have double-digit percentage increases in the number of trouble calls and service calls per customer relationship year-over-year. And that continues. It has a long runway. 
I think the bigger driver for consolidated margin really is much more about revenue mix. So if you think about what we're doing, we're adding mobile in, which has a positive EBITDA on the increment. But it has a lower structural percentage margin, if you think about it that way. We use video and mobile to drive higher attach rates for broadband, which is a high gross margin. We use it to drive higher retention of broadband. 
So we use lower stand-alone margin products to drive higher-margin acquisition and retention. And at the end of the day, that's not at all how we think about the mix. What we're thinking about is how can we create the most value in the household to drive the most products going in, that gets the most EBITDA and the most cash flow per household.
And so you could have a low revenue business with a high percentage margin and have this victory lap of high percentage margin, but you could have lower EBITDA and lower cash flow per household, and that's not the model that we deploy. So we're looking to put as much product in, much value in to get as much EBITDA and cash flow out of the household by providing products that -- and packages that our customers can't replicate and make it easy to -- for customers to stay with us for a long period of time.
So I don't want to give a guidance on where margin is going, other than it's going to be much more of a function of our lower video losses, continued growth in mobile, continued growth in Internet, which goes the opposite direction. But the biggest thing to focus on us is free cash flow and free cash flow per share."

Some of that will be timing driven, but -- as I talked about earlier. But it's going to increase our sales commissions. It's going to increase the number of installations that we do, which has OpEx into, a lesser extent, CapEx. It will increase the number of newer tenured customers who tend to call more frequently at the beginning. So operating cost and a higher transaction environment and higher churn environment move up. 
And in some sense, that's what we're hoping for, is that we'll have OpEx pressure because our sales will be accelerating and our net adds would be higher. And that's not the environment that we've been in the first half. And so we'll just do a good job of explaining that as it's taking place, but we've been trying to condition people for that environment since the beginning of the year. And it's happening later than we expected and may continue to push out. 
The other item that -- in the cost category of the bad debt, which goes along if you're nonpay. And it also attaches to -- it's driven as well by people just moving and churn generally. 
The CapEx is less impacted. From a volume standpoint, yes, you'll have a little bit more CPE purchase. You'll have a little bit more capitalized install, but it doesn't move around quite as rapidly in that environment as you'd see in OpEx. 
On share repurchase, we've been targeting a leverage to be at the mid to high end of our target leverage range. So the buybacks, we think about the long-term value of Charter, and we think it's high. And so really, when we look at buybacks, it's more about the target leverage range target as opposed to trying to be opportunistic. We're not day triggers. We have a good long-term view on the value of Charter. And so our buyback is much more enforced by our target leverage, where we expect to be at the end of the..."

The -- David Kline appreciates your complement to the industry-leading, I'm sure, Jessica. But the driver here is we've really had an enhanced ability to sell the long-tail inventory and be able to monetize what was previously not utilized. And we have a tool that's called Audience App. Because we have all of the set-top box data in an aggregated, anonymized way for all of our customer base, we have the ability to present that to buyers of advertising and sell the long-tail inventory in a way that you were never able to do because Nielsen doesn't go very deep. And so we can tell -- sell that on a zone basis. We can sell it on a split-avail basis, addressable. And we can really effectively guarantee buyer impressions across not just the traditional set-top box base, but clearly, through the increasing amount of IP-based viewing that we have off a Spectrum TV app, which is on Apple TV, on Roku, on Samsung TV and all these other devices, iOS devices, Android and really monetize those impressions and monetize the set-top box inventory in a very similar way. 
So I do think that we're leading the charge of moving the entire advertising space to an impression-based viewing, and being able to show it to a buyer where across all of the different channels that they can get placement and to be able to validate and verify on the back end that those eyeballs were actually captured and that they had a good return. We've also been investing in addition to more forward-thinking areas like addressability, which we're selling; split avails, which we have capabilities on; but also moving into using everything that I just described before, moving into attribution as well. And that's the Holy Grail here of being able to sell and then to go back and -- or take it right to the customer what exactly it drove in terms of sales for them.
So we have a fully -- full set of advertising capabilities that we offer to a client, super local when needed, addressable when needed. And we do it in traditional set-top box impression-based viewing and digital, which we sell as well. So despite the fact that the local ad sales market isn't all the way back, it's actually down relative to 2019. Certain segments like auto aren't performing as well because they don't have a lot of inventory. But despite that, our overall ad sales are up versus 2019, primarily driven by all the different capabilities that I described and the ability to make use of inventory that wasn't previously monetized."

We performed well in the third quarter with good customer growth and very strong financial results. However, we're operating in an unusual environment where the market effects of COVID-19 have not yet normalized. Market churn remains historically low such that net gains are being driven by much lower transaction activity. 
Despite that, for the full quarter, we added 185,000 customer relationships with customer growth of 3.3% year-over-year. We also added 265,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.3 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 4.4%. We added 244,000 mobile lines. And supported by lower churn and a more tenured customer base, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by a strong 13.9% and our quarterly free cash flow by over $700 million year-over-year. 
Our view is that we have a long and robust runway of customer growth ahead of us. Today, our network passes over 54 million homes and businesses. And we're doing business with approximately 32 million of them, leaving us with over 20 million opportunities to create new customer relationships. There are also approximately 120 million mobile broadband lines in our footprint, and we're currently serving 3.2 million of those. 
We're currently very underpenetrated. We're looking forward -- looking forward, we remain focused on improving both the quality and value of our products as data usage in the home and outside the home continues to increase at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, we launched our new and highly attractive unlimited multiline pricing structure, which allows customers to save even more on their mobile bills. 
Early next year, we will launch a field trial of our CBRS small cells in a full market area, allowing participants to attach to our CBS -- CBRS small cell access points when they are outside of WiFi coverage, providing our Spectrum Mobile customers with even faster speeds while improving the economics of our mobile business. 
We also continued to deliver improving wireline connectivity products. Today, over 70% of our Internet customers subscribe to tiers that provide 200 megabits or more of speed. And our new WiFi 6 routers and Spectrum WiFi pods managed by our Advanced Home WiFi platform in our My Spectrum app provide customers with complete home coverage and greater control of their home networks and connected devices. 
As expected, we continue to see very high demand for data by our customers. During the quarter, nonvideo Internet customers used over 600 gigabytes per month, stable as of late, but more than 30% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And today, close to 20% of our nonvideo Internet customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. 
In order to increase the capacity and speed on our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multifaceted approach to our network evolution, comprised of a number of technologies which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. We continue to expand our capacity by splitting nodes, but we have a cost-effective approach to deliver multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and a gigabit per second symmetrical speeds in both downstream and upstream directions, all using our deployed DOCSIS 3.1 platform. 
And high splits, which are currently being tested in market, not only allow for increased fees in the near term, but are also a capital efficient way as they currently use deployed DOCSIS 3.1 customer premises equipment and reduce the need for node splits, which require an average consumer bandwidth utilization, which would acquire -- which were required as consumer bandwidth utilization increase. 
So what I'm saying there is that the high split actually uses the capital that was needed for node splits. We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 technology plan architecture and rollout, which allows us to cost effectively and cost efficiently offer greater gigabit speeds in both the downstream and upstream. 
And of course, we're already using fiber-to-the-home technology in a number of use cases across our footprint, including rural areas, such as our RDOF build and in MDUs and greenfield build areas where the economics make sense. Ultimately, our plant will be comprised of the most bandwidth-rich and cost-effective technologies, enabling us to deliver the fastest speeds in the industry in a more cost-efficient manner than competitors ubiquitously across 24 million passings and growing. 
So with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers penetration, EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come. 
Before turning the call over to Chris, I want to make a few comments about our recently announced management changes and promotions. On October 19, we announced that John Bickham had been appointed Vice Chairman, ahead of his previously announced retirement at the end of 2022. I've worked with John for 3 decades. And in every turn, his knowledge, leadership and steady hand had not only contributed greatly to the success of the companies we led but made a profound impact on the growth of our industry. I'm grateful that John will continue to serve Charter in his new capacity as a strategic adviser to me and the executive team. 
We also recently announced that Chris Winfrey had been promoted as Chief Operating Officer. Over the past 11 years, Chris' influence on Charter has expanded far beyond that of a typical CFO. He's been actively involved in all our business operations. And that deep knowledge, combined with his previous operational experience in Europe, will serve us well as Charter's next Chief Operating Officer. And John's guidance as Vice Chairman will help ensure a successful transition for Chris into the COO role. 
As Chris moves to COO, we've also promoted Jessica Fischer, previously Executive Vice President of Finance, to Chief Financial Officer. Jessica's leadership and financial expertise has benefited Charter for many years, both in her roles at Charter and while at E&Y, where she was a key adviser during our 2016 transactions. In her new role, Jessica will have an even greater impact on Charter's success. 
Finally, Rich DiGeronimo, our Chief Product and Technology Officer, adds the oversight of network and software operations to his current responsibilities, leading the product and technology organization. With expanded responsibility, Rich will both shape the customer experience and lead our network's critical evolution into the 10G future, delivering to our customers a superior broadband connectivity experience. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I wanted to make a few comments about what we're seeing in the marketplace and briefly discuss our long-term market opportunity. Residential customer activity, particularly churn, has taken longer than we expected to return to normal levels.",699,"Thanks, Tom. I wanted to make a few comments about what we're seeing in the marketplace and briefly discuss our long-term market opportunity. Residential customer activity, particularly churn, has taken longer than we expected to return to normal levels. 
The overall lower level of market churn has reduced sales opportunities available to us. But interestingly, the value of net additions is even higher in this environment. We still maintain good continued customer growth. 
Given that the start of Q4 feels similar to Q3, we now expect current year Internet net adds to look more like 2018 than 2019 as record low churn of every type has not offset the higher loss of selling opportunities from competitors' churn. That lower overall transaction volume has exposed the high level of underlying EBITDA and cash flow growth that is normally masked by even higher unit growth. With fewer new customers than usual, we have a lower mix of customers on promotion, benefiting our customer relationship ARPU. 
Additionally, the lower sales volume has driven lower expense and capital expenditures associated with sales and installation, lower upfront provisioning cost and fewer service calls and truck rolls, which are more frequent with newer customers. Ultimately, market churn will return, driving more sales opportunities and a return to normal net addition environment for Charter. As that happens, we would expect a reversal of some of the transactional financial benefits I mentioned a moment ago. We thought that would happen by the summer of this year, but it hasn't happened quite yet. 
Lower transactions have lowered cost, and at the same time, our cost per existing customer relationship continues to get better. Our service model drives lower service calls and truck rolls with nearly 100% insourcing of our call centers now, improving tools for our employees and increasing customer usage of our digital and automated platforms. The service, churn and expense benefits of those initiatives will continue for years. 
We've also continued to invest in our product, marketing, sales capabilities. And our yield for close rate has been growing, albeit on lower sales traffic. And we continue to grow Internet customers across our footprint regardless of the competitive technology or infrastructure. 
Earlier this month, we announced new mobile multiline pricing designed to drive new mobile relationships, more lines per relationship and ultimately stimulate overall market movement and sales opportunities for all of our products, including Internet. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package. And we offer the nation's fastest overall mobile service, combined with our WiFi and best mobile pricing, which offers unlimited service for just $29.99 per line per month when households have 2 or more lines. 
An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors with 2 lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband spends approximately $200 per month on its telecom services. With our pricing and packaging, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and 2 lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less. And with more lines means more savings, and customers can also combine by the gig rate plans for $14 per gig with 1 or more unlimited lines to take advantage of the new $29.99 unlimited line pricing. 
Today, we have roughly 2 million of our 54 million passing subscribed to this converged connectivity service. So as Tom mentioned, we have a very long runway for customer and market share growth created by an ability to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. 
As Tom mentioned, Jessica has been promoted to CFO. I've had the opportunity to work with Jessica for over 10 years, 5 years while she was a partner at E&Y advising us, including on the structure of the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. 
In the past 5 years, she's been at Charter, she's steadily grown her responsibilities from initially overseeing tax and treasury to adding procurement, internal audit, investor relations and acquisitions and capital markets activities, all of which has prepared her to take over the CFO role. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica to cover our Q3 results in more detail."

Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. We grew to",1094,"Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. 
We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 185,000 in the third quarter and by 1 million in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 265,000 in the quarter and by 1.3 million or 4.4% over the last 12 months. 
Video declined by 121,000 in the third quarter. Wireline voice declined by 216,000, and we added 244,000 mobile lines in the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had 3.2 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. 
Moving to our financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by over 900,000 or 3.2%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 5.6% year-over-year, given last year's third quarter residential revenue adjustment of $218 million for sports network credits that we provided to video customers as well as promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and a greater mix of longer-tenured customers. 
Those were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of Choice, Essentials and Stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 9.4% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts. 
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 7.5%. This growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $11 million that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 6.3%, faster than the second quarter growth when making the same COVID-related adjustment. 
Enterprise revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year and included some onetime fees, which were a benefit in this quarter. Excluding the benefit from this year, enterprise revenue grew by 3.8% and by 6.5% when additionally excluding all wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.5% year-over-year. 
Third quarter advertising revenue declined 15.1% year-over-year primarily due to less political revenue in 2021, partially offset by COVID impacts last year. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, advertising revenue declined by 0.8% primarily due to local ad revenue, particularly auto, mostly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Excluding auto, the third quarter advertising grew by 8% over the third quarter of 2019. 
Mobile revenue totaled $535 million with $201 million of that revenue being device revenue. And other revenue grew by 6.5% year-over-year. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year. 
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In Q3, total operating expenses grew by $460 million or 6.2% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. 
Programming increased 9.4% year-over-year due to last year's third quarter benefit of $163 million related to sports network rebates and higher programming rates. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream. 
Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 3.5% primarily driven by higher regulatory and franchise fees and video CPE sold to customers. Cost to service customers were essentially flat year-over-year compared to 3.3% customer relationship growth. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers declined by 2.8% year-over-year. And that's despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Bad debt was higher by $47 million year-over-year, but still nearly $75 million lower when compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
Marketing expenses were also flat year-over-year primarily driven by the lower sales environment. Mobile expenses totaled $607 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses grew by 3.8% driven primarily by higher corporate costs, partially offset by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year given the absence of political revenue this year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13.9% in the quarter. 
Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $814 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the third quarter, below last year's third quarter spend of $2 billion driven by lower scalable infrastructure spend primarily due to a stabilized level of network traffic growth and investments made earlier this year, a decrease in line extension spend driven by housing built delays due to supply chain constraints in the housing industry and lower support capital primarily due to timing. 
We spent $119 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-out. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. 
As Slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of $722 million or 41.2% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.9 billion in debt principal. 
Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in October is $4.1 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.32x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $753 per share. Year-to-date, we purchased $12 billion of our stock in common units. And since September of 2016, we have repurchased $51.4 billion or 37.5% of Charter's equity at an average price of $436 per share. 
Our results show that even in this unusual environment, our flexible and robust business and service model, which benefits economically from lower customer transaction activity, still drives outstanding EBITDA and free cash flow. Coupling that with our unique balance sheet structure and a proven capital allocation strategy, we will continue to produce shareholder value for years to come. 
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

And then a question on -- for Tom really on your CapEx comments this morning. It looks like you're going to deploy high split, and that will probably reduce the need of doing nodes that's going forward. Can you sort of talk about broadly the cost impact of that shift in strategy if you sort of go down that path? Does it sort of bring forward some CapEx, while the total CapEx does not really change over the long term? Is that really the message?"

And we are deploying it in market to see how it works and how it actually works in the real world. But our sense of it is that you get symmetrical gigabit speeds out of it, but you also get the augmentation capacity that we've been spending capital on for years as average consumer growth and usage of data continues to increase. 
And so when you take the actual capital and net that against it, it becomes a very low cost of incremental capital and at the same time, becomes operationally a lot more capable in terms of the products that you can deliver on the network. So we think it's a very capitally efficient way of upgrading the network and maintaining our superiority from a competitive point of view everywhere we operate. 
The -- in terms of how we're doing in the marketplace and what the competitive environment is like, the competitive environment is similar to what it's been. And when we look at the effects of the marketplace in terms of net adds and in the churn environment we're in, we're seeing the same effect where there are no wireline competitors as we do with wireline competitors in terms of net adds proportionately to, say, 2019. 
And so we're seeing that the competitive environment doesn't appear to be significantly different than it has been. It's always been a competitive environment and that the effects of lower activity are throughout the marketplace regardless of what the infrastructure we're competing against is."

One is, you guys are obviously describing an environment that is impacting net adds tied to activity, but the market is focused on competition. 
If we were to look at markets that Charter operates in with fiber competition, I know AT&T has been adding fiber for a number of years. Would we see a dramatically different business in terms of penetration and ARPU and even kind of pricing strategy than if we looked at Charter's footprint in DSL markets? I think that'd be a helpful framework to think about this? 
And then number two is on the network, again, sort of following Vijay's line of thought. And Chris, be interested in your perspective, given your European experience. We're seeing some cable companies in Europe essentially skip DOCSIS 4.0 and go fiber. I know there's major structural differences there versus here. 
But I'm just wondering if there's any thought in your head about where fiber might make sense or what would cause you to move towards fiber-to-the-home versus 4.0 and extended spectrum DOCSIS, which seems to be your sort of Plan A right now. Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on those 2."

It's sometimes service and sometimes the overall product mix, including the mobile piece of it. So we've found ways to make our product work regardless of the operating environment."

The quarter came in strong even when backing out the COVID comps against last year. I know this was partly related to the June rate event, but you also noted benefits from a more favorable customer mix, given how low churn has been.

But I do think you pointed out something. 
The lower churn environment benefits us in a large number of ways. And one of those is on the ARPU side. The longer that a customer stays with us, you have more customers who sort of roll off of promotional packages and therefore, roll into higher pricing packages. And as we have sort of a low churn environment where you have additional longer-tenured customers, we do see some impact on ARPU from that. 
The other piece that's in there that you pointed out is the additional programmers sort of pass-through costs that we pushed at the end of the quarter. So there's a mix of the 3. There will, I think, if we continue to be in the low churn environment continue to be some ARPU impact, just as having longer tenured customers in the system. 
And the financial results of having those customers in the system for longer really are very good, both on the revenue and the transaction side, which is some of what you see in the overall financial results for the quarter."

Our target for CBRS, I've said before, is -- could be pushing 1/3 of the marketplace if everything works and it's fully deployed. Now you're talking years of runway necessary to deploy that and to get it fully utilized. 
But the good thing about it is that the capital associated with any construction we do is dedicated to a lower cost. In other words, if we're going to put out a device or a radio, we know where the traffic flows are. And we know that the traffic flows in that particular area justify the capital of placing that device. And that the offload percentage that's associated with that specific geography is sufficient to pay back the capital investment in the radio.

And then following up from one of the earlier questions. The -- I recognize the color you're giving on the transition of the network to high splits, and that's extremely helpful. I'm wondering if you can give us some indication of how long that transition to high splits across the network will take? And then when more or less you expect to start folding in the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade? 
And then my final question on broadband adds. Are you assuming any benefit in the broadband add guidance that you're giving for 4Q effectively from a pull-through from the lower wireless rate plans that you've put out there? So if wireless accelerates, should that have a pull-through benefit to broadband, and is that baked into your expectations?"

When we look at your wireless pricing strategy, you've done the exact opposite of what the major carriers are doing, which is you've offered your consumers a great deal on their service price, but you're not necessarily offering a promo on the handsets. And so that leads to sort of 2 questions. 
The first is, what are you thinking about handset promotions? Meaning would you be willing to also incorporate them into your price point, particularly as consumers look to upgrade to 5G devices and they're offered promos elsewhere? 
And then bigger picture, I mean, the key reason it looks like you were able to lower your prices recently because you were able to get a better cost structure under the MVNO agreement, meaning that you took your lower costs, and you converted them into lower prices. And so the question would be if you're pleased with the success of the CBRS trial, what does that mean for your wireless business? Does it mean that you have an opportunity to be more profitable? Or do you think that's an opportunity to take your price point down even further because once again, you'll lower your costs?"

So if you think about a customer, a typical 2-line household, they might be spending a total of $200 on broadband and mobile. And today, we're only getting a relatively small piece of that. And so if we continue to sell mobile product even if we do it by bringing the pricing of mobile down, our expectation is that we'll continue to drive both revenue growth and bottom line EBITDA growth from that business, all while driving pricing down in the mobile industry. 
And from the perspective of our mobile business, I mean, even today, our mobile business is profitable if you take customer acquisition costs out. And like what we've done across our business, our goal is always to further penetrate the market. And so if we can increase our penetration of the mobile market and have more sort of ongoing revenues and less customer acquisition costs or not less, even with additional customer acquisition costs, we'll generate strong profits out of that business just by penetrating the market, sticking with our strategy of having sort of very competitive pricing for our customers."

But our video product, we have something for everybody, whether it's a full expanded package, whether it's [indiscernible], whether it's Essential, Stream, Choice, in the home, outside the home on every single device. 
So we have a package and a price point for just about everybody. And still about half of our Internet sales still take video, and it causes them to retain. So we're able to add value to these households, not just by having a national low retail pricing structure for broadband, but the ability to use video and to use the savings from mobile to compete now and really for a long period of time. 
So that's how we approach the marketplace. It's really how we've always approached the marketplace, including back to if you think about phone where the pricing and again, it's only maybe half the customer base that's relevant for it, but it is relevant for half where we have a $12 price point for phone as well.

And so we've got more than 10 million customers who are connected to us strictly through a streaming relationship. And we like the Comcast strategy with regard to their putting their platform on televisions. And so we think there's lots of opportunity for us to continue to change the video model and to take advantage of our relationship with customers and to make the video model more efficient for programmers and for operators and to bring value back into television."

We performed well in the third quarter with good customer growth and very strong financial results. However, we're operating in an unusual environment where the market effects of COVID-19 have not yet normalized. Marke",1082,"Good morning, and thank you, Stefan. We performed well in the third quarter with good customer growth and very strong financial results. However, we're operating in an unusual environment where the market effects of COVID-19 have not yet normalized. Market churn remains historically low, such that net gains are being driven by much lower transaction activity.  
Despite that, for the full quarter, we added 185,000 customer relationships, with customer growth of 3.3% year-over-year. We also added 265,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.3 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 4.4%. 
We added 244,000 mobile lines. And supported by lower churn and a more tenured customer base, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by a strong 13.9% and our quarterly free cash flow by over $700 million year-over-year.  
Our view is that we have a long and robust runway of customer growth ahead of us. Today, our network passes over 54 million homes and businesses, and we're doing business with approximately 32 million of them, leaving us with over 20 million opportunities to create new customer relationships. There are also approximately 120 million mobile broadband lines in our footprint, and we're currently serving 3.2 million of those.  
We're currently very underpenetrated. We're looking forward -- looking forward, we remain focused on improving both the quality and value of our products as data usage in the home and outside the home continues to increase at a rapid pace. 
Earlier this month, we launched our new and highly attractive unlimited multiline pricing structure, which allows customers to save even more on their mobile bills.
Early next year, we will launch a field trial of our CBRS small cells in a full market area, allowing participants to attach to our CBS -- CBRS small cell access points when they are outside of WiFi coverage, providing our Spectrum Mobile customers with even faster speeds while improving the economics of our mobile business.  
We also continued to deliver improving wireline connectivity products. Today, over 70% of our Internet customers subscribe to tiers that provide 200 megabits or more of speed. And our new WiFi 6 routers and Spectrum WiFi pods managed by our Advanced Home WiFi platform in our My Spectrum app provide customers with complete home coverage and greater control of their home networks and connected devices.  
As expected, we continue to see very high demand for data by our customers. During the quarter, nonvideo Internet customers used over 600 gigabytes per month, stable as of late, but more than 30% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And today, close to 20% of our nonvideo Internet customers use a terabyte or more of data per month.  
In order to increase the capacity and speed on our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multifaceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies, which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. 
We continue to expand our capacity by splitting nodes, but we have a cost-effective approach to deliver multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and a gigabit per second symmetrical speeds in both downstream and upstream directions, all using our deployed DOCSIS 3.1 platform.  
And high splits, which are currently being tested in market, not only allow for increased speeds in the near term, but are also a capital efficient way as they currently use deployed DOCSIS 3.1 customer premises equipment and reduce the need for node splits, which require an average consumer bandwidth utilization, which would acquire -- which were required as consumer bandwidth utilization increase. So what I'm saying there is that the high split actually uses the capital that was needed for node splits. 
We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 technology plan architecture and rollout, which allows us to cost effectively and cost efficiently offer greater gigabit speeds in both the downstream and upstream.  
And of course, we're already using fiber-to-the-home technology in a number of use cases across our footprint, including rural areas, such as our RDOF build and in MDUs and greenfield build areas where the economics make sense. Ultimately, our plant will be comprised of the most bandwidth-rich and cost-effective technologies, enabling us to deliver the fastest speeds in the industry in a more cost-efficient manner than competitors ubiquitously across 24 million passings and growing.  
So with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers penetration, EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come.  
Before turning the call over to Chris, I want to make a few comments about our recently announced management changes and promotions. On October 19, we announced that John Bickham had been appointed Vice Chairman ahead of his previously announced retirement at the end of 2022. I've worked with John for 3 decades. And in every turn, his knowledge, leadership and steady hand had not only contributed greatly to the success of the companies we led, but made a profound impact on the growth of our industry. I'm grateful that John will continue to serve Charter in his new capacity as a strategic adviser to me and the executive team.  
We also recently announced that Chris Winfrey had been promoted Chief Operating Officer. Over the past 11 years, Chris' influence on Charter has expanded far beyond that of a typical CFO. He's been actively involved in all our business operations. And that deep knowledge, combined with his previous operational experience in Europe, will serve us well as Charter's next Chief Operating Officer. And John's guidance as Vice Chairman will help ensure a successful transition for Chris into the COO role.  
As Chris moves to COO, we've also promoted Jessica Fischer, previously Executive Vice President of Finance, to Chief Financial Officer. Jessica's leadership and financial expertise has benefited Charter for many years, both in her roles at Charter and while at E&Y, where she was a key adviser during our 2016 transactions. In her new role, Jessica will have an even greater impact on Charter's success.  
Finally, Rich DiGeronimo, our Chief Product and Technology Officer, adds the oversight of network and software operations to his current responsibilities, leading the product and technology organization. With expanded responsibility, Rich will both shape the customer experience and lead our network's critical evolution into the 10G future, delivering to our customers a superior broadband connectivity experience.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I wanted to make a few comments about what we're seeing in the marketplace and briefly discuss our long-term market opportunity. Residential customer activity, particularly churn, has taken longer than we expected to return to normal levels. The overall lower level of market churn has reduced sales opportunities available to us. But interestingly, the value of net additions is even higher in this environment. We still maintain good continued customer growth.  
Given that the start of Q4 feels similar to Q3, we now expect current year Internet net adds to look more like 2018 than 2019, as record low churn of every type has not offset the higher loss of selling opportunities from competitors' churn. 
That lower overall transaction volume has exposed the high level of underlying EBITDA and cash flow growth that is normally masked by even higher unit growth. With fewer new customers than usual, we have a lower mix of customers on promotion, benefiting our customer relationship ARPU.  
Additionally, the lower sales volume has driven lower expense and capital expenditures associated with sales and installation, lower upfront provisioning cost and fewer service calls and truck rolls, which are more frequent with newer customers. 
Ultimately, market churn will return, driving more sales opportunities and a return to normal net addition environment for Charter. As that happens, we would expect a reversal of some of the transactional financial benefits I mentioned a moment ago. We thought that would happen by the summer of this year, but it hasn't happened quite yet.  
Lower transactions have lowered cost. And at the same time, our cost per existing customer relationship continues to get better. Our service model drives lower service calls and truck rolls, with nearly 100% insourcing of our call centers now, improving tools for our employees and increasing customer usage of our digital and automated platforms. The service, churn and expense benefits of those initiatives will continue for years.  
We've also continued to invest in our product, marketing, sales capabilities, and our yield for close rate has been growing, albeit on lower sales traffic. And we continue to grow Internet customers across our footprint, regardless of the competitive technology or infrastructure.  
Earlier this month, we announced new mobile multiline pricing designed to drive new mobile relationships, more lines per relationship and ultimately stimulate overall market movement and sales opportunities for all of our products, including Internet. 
Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package, and we offer the nation's fastest overall mobile service, combined with our WiFi and best mobile pricing, which offers unlimited service for just $29.99 per line per month when households have 2 or more lines.  
An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors with 2 lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband spends approximately $200 per month on its telecom services. With our pricing and packaging, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and 2 lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less, and with more lines means more savings. And customers can also combine by the gig rate plans for $14 per gig with one or more unlimited lines to take advantage of the new $29.99 unlimited line pricing.  
Today, we have roughly 2 million of our 54 million passing subscribed to this converged connectivity service. So as Tom mentioned, we have a very long runway for customer and market share growth created by an ability to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service.  
As Tom mentioned, Jessica has been promoted to CFO. I've had the opportunity to work with Jessica for over 10 years, 5 years while she was a partner at E&Y advising us, including on the structure of the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. In the past 5 years she's been at Charter, she's steadily grown her responsibilities from initially overseeing tax and treasury to adding procurement, internal audit, investor relations and acquisitions and capital markets activities, all of which has prepared her to take over the CFO role.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica to cover our Q3 results in more detail."

Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons.  We grew t",1095,"Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slides 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons.  
We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 185,000 in the third quarter and by 1 million in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 265,000 in the quarter and by 1.3 million or 4.4% over the last 12 months.  
Video declined by 121,000 in the third quarter. Wireline voice declined by 216,000, and we added 244,000 mobile lines in the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had 3.2 million mobile lines. 
Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service, rather than using device subsidies.  
Moving to our financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by over 900,000 or 3.2%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 5.6% year-over-year given last year's third quarter residential revenue adjustment of $218 million for sports network credits that we provided to video customers as well as promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and a greater mix of longer tenured customers.  
Those were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of Choice, Essentials and Stream customers within our video base. 
Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 9.4% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts.
Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 7.5%. This growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $11 million that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 6.3%, faster than the second quarter growth when making the same COVID-related adjustment.  
Enterprise revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year and included some onetime fees, which were a benefit in this quarter. Excluding the benefit from this year, enterprise revenue grew by 3.8% and by 6.5% when additionally excluding all wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.5% year-over-year.  
Third quarter advertising revenue declined 15.1% year-over-year primarily due to less political revenue in 2021, partially offset by COVID impacts last year. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, advertising revenue declined by 0.8% primarily due to local ad revenue, particularly auto, mostly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Excluding auto, the third quarter advertising grew by 8% over the third quarter of 2019.  
Mobile revenue totaled $535 million, with $201 million of that revenue being device revenue, and other revenue grew by 6.5% year-over-year. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year.  
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In Q3, total operating expenses grew by $460 million or 6.2% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects.  
Programming increased 9.4% year-over-year due to last year's third quarter benefit of $163 million related to sports network rebates and higher programming rates. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream.  
Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 3.5% primarily driven by higher regulatory and franchise fees and video CPE sold to customers. 
Cost to service customers were essentially flat year-over-year compared to 3.3% customer relationship growth. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers declined by 2.8% year-over-year, and that's despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Bad debt was higher by $47 million year-over-year, but still nearly $75 million lower when compared to the third quarter of 2019.  
Marketing expenses were also flat year-over-year primarily driven by the lower sales environment. Mobile expenses totaled $607 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. 
And other expenses grew by 3.8% driven primarily by higher corporate costs, partially offset by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year given the absence of political revenue this year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13.9% in the quarter.  
Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $814 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA.  
Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the third quarter, below last year's third quarter spend of $2 billion driven by lower scalable infrastructure spend primarily due to a stabilized level of network traffic growth and investments made earlier this year, a decrease in line extension spend driven by housing built delays due to supply chain constraints in the housing industry and lower support capital primarily due to timing.  
We spent $119 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-out. 
For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020.  
As Slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of $722 million or 41.2% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.9 billion in debt principal.  
Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in October is $4.1 billion. 
As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.32x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range.  
During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $753 per share. Year-to-date, we purchased $12 billion of our stock in common units, and since September of 2016, we have repurchased $51.4 billion or 37.5% of Charter's equity at an average price of $436 per share.  
Our results show that even in this unusual environment, our flexible and robust business and service model, which benefits economically from lower customer transaction activity, still drives outstanding EBITDA and free cash flow. Coupling that with our unique balance sheet structure and a proven capital allocation strategy, we will continue to produce shareholder value for years to come.  
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

And then a question on -- for Tom really on your CapEx comments this morning. It looks like you're going to deploy high split, and that will probably reduce the need of doing node splits going forward. 
Can you sort of talk about broadly the cost impact of that shift in strategy if you sort of go down that path? Does it sort of bring forward some CapEx, while the total CapEx does not really change over the long term? Is that really the message?"

And we are deploying it in market to see how it works and how it actually works in the real world. But our sense of it is that you get symmetrical gigabit speeds out of it, but you also get the augmentation capacity that we've been spending capital on for years, as average consumer growth and usage of data continues to increase.  
And so when you take the actual capital and net that against it, it becomes a very low cost of incremental capital and, at the same time, becomes operationally a lot more capable in terms of the products that you can deliver on the network. 
So we think it's a very capital efficient way of upgrading the network and maintaining our superiority from a competitive point of view everywhere we operate. 
The -- in terms of how we're doing in the marketplace and what the competitive environment is like, the competitive environment is similar to what it's been. And when we look at the effects of the marketplace in terms of net adds and in the churn environment we're in, we're seeing the same effect where there are no wireline competitors as we do with wireline competitors in terms of net adds proportionately to, say, 2019.  
And so we're seeing that the competitive environment doesn't appear to be significantly different than it has been. It's always been a competitive environment, and that the effects of lower activity are throughout the marketplace, regardless of what the infrastructure we're competing against is."

One is, you guys are obviously describing an environment that is impacting net adds tied to activity, but the market is focused on competition.  
If we were to look at markets that Charter operates in with fiber competition, I know AT&T has been adding fiber for a number of years, would we see a dramatically different business in terms of penetration and ARPU and even kind of pricing strategy than if we looked at Charter's footprint in DSL markets? I think that'd be a helpful framework to think about this. 
And then number two is on the network, again, sort of following Vijay's line of thought. And Chris, be interested in your perspective given your European experience. We're seeing some cable companies in Europe essentially skip DOCSIS 4.0 and go fiber. I know there's major structural differences there versus here.  
But I'm just wondering if there's any thought in your head about where fiber might make sense or what would cause you to move towards fiber-to-the-home versus 4.0 and extended spectrum DOCSIS, which seems to be your sort of Plan A right now. Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on those 2."

So we've been able to grow market share in every environment we operate in pretty much in terms of facilities based competition for a variety of reasons. It's not just capacity in every case. It's sometimes service, sometimes the overall product mix, including the mobile piece of it. So we've found ways to make our product work, regardless of the operating environment."

The quarter came in strong, even when backing out the COVID comps against last year. I know this was partly related to the June rate event, but you also noted benefits from a more favorable customer mix given how low churn has been.  
I guess, given your commentary on 2021 net adds looking more like 2018, should we assume these positive ARPU trends could continue not only into the fourth quarter, but also into early 2022?

So first, I would point you back to the churn in the COVID picture that there is a big piece of the year-over-year ARPU increase that's related to the revenue credits in Q3 of last year. 
But I do think you pointed out something. The lower churn environment benefits us in a large number of ways, and one of those is on the ARPU side. The longer that a customer stays with us, you have more customers who sort of roll off of promotional packages and, therefore, roll into higher pricing packages. And as we have sort of a low churn environment where you have additional longer tenured customers, we do see some impact on ARPU from that.  
The other piece that's in there that you pointed out is the additional programmers sort of pass-through costs that we pushed at the end of the quarter. 
So there's a mix of the 3. There will, I think, if we continue to be in the low churn environment continue to be some ARPU impact just as having longer tenured customers in the system.  
And the financial results of having those customers in the system for longer really are very good, both on the revenue and the transaction side, which is some of what you see in the overall financial results for the quarter."

Vast majorities come into that program through our existing subscribers, but we're utilizing that federal program to make sure that we service that community and continue to actively market, sell and service into the space.  
But your point is true. There was certainly a lot of people who had been on wireless substitution in the past or had affordability issues that, through the things that we did cooperating with the federal government, we were able to get them to proper broadband.

In terms of CBRS, today, 80% of the traffic on mobile platforms is on WiFi. And our -- and we continue to use the WiFi network effectively, and there's a whole new piece of spectrum available to WiFi available to us. So WiFi and CBRS together have an opportunity to make a significant change in how much traffic is on our network versus on the MVNO. 
Our target for CBRS, I've said before, is -- could be pushing 1/3 of the marketplace if everything works and it's fully deployed. Now you're talking years of runway necessary to deploy that and to get it fully utilized. But the good thing about it is that the capital associated with any construction we do is dedicated to a lower cost. 
In other words, if we're going to put out a device or a radio, we know where the traffic flows are, and we know that the traffic flows in that particular area justify the capital of placing that device, and that the offload percentage that's associated with that specific geography is sufficient to pay back the capital investment in the radio. 
So it's a -- we'll deploy that based on actual utilization. But our modeling shows that it could be a significant reduction in the overall traffic load on the MVNO."

I'm wondering if you can give us some indication of how long that transition to high splits across the network will take and then when more or less you expect to start folding in the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade.

And then bigger picture, I mean, the key reason it looks like you were able to lower your prices recently is because you were able to get a better cost structure under the MVNO agreement, meaning that you took your lower costs, and you converted them into lower prices. 
And so the question would be if you're pleased with the success of the CBRS trial, what does that mean for your wireless business? Does it mean that you have an opportunity to be more profitable?

So if you think about a customer, a typical 2-line household, they might be spending a total of $200 on broadband and mobile. And today, we're only getting a relatively small piece of that. 
And so if we continue to sell mobile product, even if we do it by bringing the pricing of mobile down, our expectation is that we'll continue to drive both revenue growth and bottom line EBITDA growth from that business, all while driving pricing down in the mobile industry. 
And from the perspective of our mobile business, I mean, even today, our mobile business is profitable if you take customer acquisition costs out. And like what we've done across our business, our goal is always to further penetrate the market.

And we have the ability to bundle products that most of those competitors that you mentioned don't have. 
So if you think about low broadband pricings at national retail pricing, combined with the ability to save customers hundreds or thousands of dollars in mobile and increasingly because of where the rest of the market is gone, we have the very best video product out there. 
And that may not be for everybody because there's a lot of different ways to take video. But our video product, we have something for everybody, whether it's a full expanded package, whether it's Mi Plan Latino, whether it's Essential, Stream, Choice, in the home, outside the home on every single device. 
So we have a package and a price point for just about everybody. And still, about half of our Internet sales still take video, and it causes them to retain. So we're able to add value to these households, not just by having a national low retail pricing structure for broadband, but the ability to use video and to use the savings from mobile to compete now and really for a long period of time. 
So that's how we approach the marketplace. It's really how we've always approached the marketplace, including back to if you think about phone where the pricing and, again, it's only maybe half the customer base that's relevant for it, but it is relevant for half where we have a $12 price point for phone as well. 
So we have different ways we can save customers money. And we think the product that we offer anyway in broadband is as good, if not better, than any of the competitive footprint that we face."

Should we think about the growth opportunity really as share focus going forward in that the broadband marketplace is broadly fairly mature after this pandemic pull forward? 
And then I guess, jump ball though, Chris, I know your experience in Europe might inform this. And it seemed like Brian Roberts yesterday was implying that they're thinking about launching a converged sort of in-home, out-of-home broadband offering. And I'm sure you've been thinking about the same thing.

And so -- and I think the penetration of any kind of Internet service in that footprint is about 85%. So there's still opportunity to grow the overall connectivity broadband market. And then there's the opportunity to actually throw it into the high-capacity service that we sell and the high-quality service we sell.

There are not that many markets where, from a marketing and sales machine, it's been fully proven out yet of how you combine that together when lines are often sold at a personal level, and broadband subscription wireline is sold at a household level. So I think it's an interesting concept and one that we're keeping our eye on.
