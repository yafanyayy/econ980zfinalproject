In addi",1384,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. 2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges. The coronavirus changed our lives with astonishing speed, and what began as a promising year quickly and dramatically morphed into a global health and economic crisis. In addition to the harsh toll on human lives and livelihoods, the pandemic has brought about changes in society and business that are likely to be felt for years to come. Before I speak about Loews, I want to acknowledge and to thank everyone on the front lines of the fight against this pandemic, especially the medical professionals, the first responders and people in every industry who are risking their own safety to provide essential products and safety. While we can never sufficiently express our gratitude for their bravery and their compassion, Loews and our subsidiaries have provided philanthropic support to various organizations supplying relief and aiding recovery efforts in their community. We also want to recognize our Loews' corporate and subsidiary employees, who rose through this ongoing challenge with determination, focus and professionalism. Across the organization, our people have done their part to make sure that businesses had insurance and claims were paid, that natural gas was available to heat homes, schools and medical facilities. Our packaging was available for water and medicine bottles or that a meal was delivered to a family in a hotel room. Each of our subsidiaries went to impressive lengths to ensure the health and safety of their employees and customers. These efforts enabled us to meet the needs of our customers and communities at a critical time while continuing to move Loews forward. 
Let's look at the operational impact of COVID on each of our subsidiaries over the course of 2020, starting with CNA. Operationally, CNA's performance continues to be quite strong. While the events of 2020 were unprecedented, including impacts not only from COVID, but also from civil unrest and hurricanes, the overall trend in the property casualty insurance industry has been upwards towards a hardening market. Not only did CNA have good growth in new business, the company also benefited from higher P&C rates, leading to higher overall premium growth. Throughout the year, CNA has continued to focus on underwriting discipline, partnerships and talent. This focus has resulted in continued improvements in CNA's underlying performance, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year development. 
In 2020, CNA had an underlying combined ratio of 93.1% compared to 94.8% in 2019 and 95.4% in 2018. That represents a more than 2-point improvement over 2 years, reflecting progress in both the expense and loss ratios. Earlier today, CNA declared a special dividend of $0.75 in addition to raising its quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share. The increase in the common dividend is reflective of the CNA Board's confidence in the ongoing operational improvements at CNA. 
CNA paid total dividends of around 90% of its 2020 earnings. CNA's ability to return capital to shareholders even after the extensive cat losses the company absorbed this year, underscores its financial strength and fortress balance sheet. At Boardwalk in 2020, the company met the challenge of operating its pipelines without service interruptions to its customers, not only during COVID-19, but also through the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast. Boardwalk has completed the recontracting of its pipelines originally put into service between 2008 and 2010. While future growth projects could become more difficult to green light in the current environment, Boardwalk continues to benefit from its long-term fixed fee contracts. 
During 2020, the company added approximately $1.3 billion of new contracts and the contractual backlog ended the year at over $9 billion or 7x Boardwalk's annual 2020 revenues. Boardwalk reported EBITDA of $819 million for the year, essentially flat from 2019. As for our packaging company, Altium, demand for its products continues to be strong overall and even stronger for product segments such as household chemicals and beverages. On the flip side, as a result of the pandemic, demand is somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial foodservice and school dairy. Additionally, the company's recycling business envision has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014, driven by stronger demand for recycled product, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company continues to be successful in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. Of all our subsidiaries, Loews Hotels has been the hardest hit by the pandemic. In February, the company had occupancy rates of around 80% for its owned and joint venture hotels. By April, only 3 of these hotels were operational, and occupancy rates had plummeted to about 9%. The company responded quickly to the COVID induced downturn in a number of ways. To better align to reduced level of demand, those hotels aggressively cut expenses. They rightsize capital spending, worked with lenders to defer interest and principal pay downs and reevaluated opening dates for new developments. 
Importantly, in the face of this crisis, Loews Hotels continue to looks -- look out for its team numbers, safety and well-being, putting programs in place to assist, those negatively affected as well as implementing extensive COVID protocols and hotels as they resume operations. 
During December of 2020, occupancy rates for owned and JV hotels that were operational had risen to almost 38%, with 22 out of 27 Loews Hotels once again welcoming guests. At this point in time, leisure travel is recovering at a somewhat faster pace than business travel. But it is still difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually and as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic. That being said, we believe properties such as those in Orlando, Miami Beach and Arlington, Texas, are well positioned to participate in the early stages of the travel resurgence. It bears mentioning that throughout the pandemic, Loews and its subsidiaries continue to have ample access for the capital markets. Loews, CNA and Boardwalk each issued $500 million in bonds between May and August of 2020, taking advantage of the low rates available in the credit markets. Altium Packaging completed a debt recapitalization in January of 2021, which resulted in a $199 million payment to Loews, basically returning 1/3 of our equity, and we still own 100% of the business. This is our first dividend from Altium since acquiring the company in 2017. The success of these offerings is a testament to the strength of Loews' corporate and subsidiary balance sheets and investors confidence in our creditworthiness. 
Before I hand the call over to David, I want to talk about capital allocation. Throughout this year, I have emphatically stated my strong belief that the market has been significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we would still take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our shares. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option. That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. We provided about $150 million to Loews Hotels in 2020 to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. We will continue to support Loews Hotels in 2021 as it prepares for travel and tourism to come back with the expectation of a return to more normalized operations in 2022. 
During the fourth quarter, we purchased almost 6 million shares of Loews stock for about $244 million, while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash. Over the course of the year, Loews repurchased nearly 22 million of our own shares for an average cost of below $42 per share, which is borrower than Loews' current market price and considerably lower than what we believe to be the intrinsic value of the company.  In my view, that's a great use of capital in order to create value for all shareholders over the long term. 
And now, David, over to you."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $397 million or $1.45 per share compared to $217 million or $0.73 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported a net loss of $931 million or $3.32 per share. While in 2019, our net income was $932 million or $3.07 per share. 
I will briefly summarize our strong fourth quarter results and then turn to the full year. CNA drove the year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter income with an assist from Boardwalk. The absence of results from Diamond Offshore, which last year posted a fourth quarter loss, also helped. 
Let me share some highlights on CNA's fourth quarter. For more details, check out the transcript from today's CNA investor call. CNA's net income contribution to Loews rose 42% to $346 million, making up the bulk of our consolidated fourth quarter net income of $398 million. The core P&C business performed extremely well. Net written premium grew 12% year-over-year, thanks to robust new business, together with rate increases averaging over 12%. The combined ratio improved 2.1 points to 93.5, driven by lower expense and underlying loss ratios as well as reduced cat losses. 
After tax P&C net investment income was down slightly as higher returns on LP and common stock investments, we're not able to fully offset the impact of lower yields on the fixed income portfolio. Net investment gains, however, were greater than during the prior year quarter. The Life & Group segment posted strong results, thanks principally to favorable morbidity trends in the long-term care block. Boardwalk pipeline's net income contribution rose from $48 million in last year's fourth quarter to $83 million, which included $26 million after-tax of settlement proceeds related to a customer bankruptcy. Fourth quarter net revenues, excluding these proceeds, were up 4%, driven by growth projects recently placed into service. Loews Hotels posted a net loss of $68 million in Q4 2020 versus a net loss last year of $59 million. This year's net loss was caused by the continuing revenue challenges stemming from the pandemic, with operating revenue down 81% year-over-year. In last year's fourth quarter, Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of 2 hotel properties as well as some preopening expenses on properties under development. 
Before turning to the full year, one last observation on the quarterly comparison. The fourth quarter of 2019 included a $38 million net loss from diamond offshore. Diamond is no longer one of our consolidated subsidiaries, and thus did not affect our Q4 2020 earnings. 
Now for our full year results. We reported a net loss of $931 million or $3.32 per share. Let me start by recapping the drivers of the loss, which primarily relate to Diamond and Loews Hotels. Diamond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 26, 2020. Through that date, Diamond had contributed net losses of $476 million to Loews, mainly attributable to rig impairment charges. Further, because of the bankruptcy filing, in the second quarter, we deconsolidated Diamond, wrote down the carrying value of our investment in the company and booked a $957 million after-tax investment loss. In total, Diamond accounted for $1.43 billion of net losses to Loews in 2020. Loews Hotels has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with operating revenue down 71% for the full year. Similarly, income in joint ventures swung from positive $69 million in 2019 to a $73 million loss in 2020. This dramatic change in Loews Hotels operating environment caused the company to incur a net loss of $212 million for the year. Loews' net income declined even after entirely excluding the impact of Diamond and Loews Hotels from our results in both years. This decline was entirely attributable to higher catastrophe losses at CNA and lower results from investment related activities at CNA and the parent company. CNA booked pretax catastrophe losses of $550 million in 2020, up from $179 million in 2019. Weather-related events comprised 53% of the year's cat losses with COVID-19 and civil unrest, making up the remainder. The negative year-over-year impact to lows of CNA's unusually elevated catastrophe losses was $262 million after tax. After-tax net investment income in CNA's P&C business fell year-over-year because of lower returns on fixed income securities and limited partnership and common stock investments. This accounted for $148 million decline in Loews' net income. Similarly, the Loews parent company's net investment income declined $141 million after-tax, driven mainly by lower returns on LP and equity investments. Finally, CNA swung from net investment gains in 2019 to net investment losses in 2020. This swing reduced our net income by $60 million. In total, these items, cat losses, net investment income at CNA and Loews and CNA's net investment losses accounted for a year-over-year decline in Loews' net income of $611 million. Thankfully, there were numerous positives during 2020 worth highlighting. CNA's core P&C business, excluding catastrophes, performed extremely well. Net written premium increased 6% on the back of new business growth, solid retention and rate increases averaging 11%. The underlying combined ratio for the full year, which excludes cat losses in prior year development, was 93.1%, down from 94.8% in 2019, with improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. All of this led to a 38% increase in pretax underlying underwriting income. CNA's long-term care business continues to benefit from active operational and risk management of the block. Even including the impact of this year's active life and claim reserve reviews, the Life & Group business generated positive results, driven by better-than-expected morbidity in long-term care. CNA's balance sheet remains rock solid. Its decision to pay a $0.75 special dividend, which was announced this morning, is further evidence of CNA's dedication to financial soundness. Moreover, it continues to reduce its risk profile. Most recently with the agreement signed last week to seed a legacy portfolio of excess workers' compensation policies to a subsidiary of Enstar. 
Boardwalk had a good year operationally. Net operating revenues, excluding the settlement proceeds from a customer bankruptcy in each year were down less than 1%, reflecting the last vestiges of expirations and renewals at lower rates of long-term contracts put in place 10-plus years ago. The company's growth projects, together with a strong market for storage and park and loan services made up for most of the fall off, and Boardwalk continues to effectively manage its expenses. Altium Packaging, which is included in our corporate segment, had a strong year operationally, with revenues up almost 10%, driven by organic growth, new business, exceptional results in its recycled plastics business, the full year impact of acquisitions made in 2019 and higher year-over-year resin prices. 2020 was a record year for new business awards for Altium, further highlighting its reputation for quality, reliability, innovation and customer service. As I've mentioned in the past, Altium's results have had little effect to date on our net income. While Altium generates healthy EBITDA and free cash flow, its GAAP income has been weighed down by depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions and accelerated trade name amortization. 
Last week, Altium completed a recapitalization, issuing a $1.05 billion 7-year secured term loan, the proceeds of which went to refinance its existing debt, and pay Loews a dividend of $199 million. As Jim mentioned, this is the first distribution Loews has received from Altium since we acquired the company in 2017. Importantly, this transaction in no way Hamstrings Altium's ability to continue pursuing tuck-in acquisitions. As a reminder, our initial equity investment in Altium was slightly more than $600 million. 
Turning to the parent company. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.5 billion at year-end, with about 77% in cash and equivalents. During the fourth quarter, we received $192 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $90 million from CNA and $102 million from Boardwalk, which represented Boardwalk's only dividend to Loews in 2020. For the full year, we received total dividends of $947 million from CNA and Boardwalk. Today, CNA declared a 75% -- excuse me, $0.75 per share special dividend and a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share, up $0.01 from $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $275 million in dividends from CNA this quarter as well as the $199 million received from Altium last week. We repurchased 5.8 million shares in the fourth quarter for $244 million and 22 million shares during the full year for $917 million. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 2.2 million shares for a total of $100 million. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So one of the good things about getting the questions in advance is that I can prepare a thoughtful and detailed answers as I have, especially on this one. So we assess some of the parts value-based on our view of the intrinsic value of each of our subsidiaries. Intrinsic value is our view of what our subsidiaries are worth based on our medium- to long-range outlook. And the valuation can and often does differ from the current market value of those enterprises. Our outlook for each subsidiary is informed by our view of the industry in which it operates and then competitive strengths and weaknesses of our subsidiaries. So let's take a look at these subsidiary by subsidiary. 
Starting with CNA, the primary indicator is that we look at our core earnings, the combined ratio, we look at earnings per share, dividend capacity, pricing and loss trends. Based on these metrics, we believe CNA is undervalued compared to its peers and even more so compared to the overall markets. We are bullish on the commercially property and casualty insurance industry, and we also believe that CNA will be able to continue to take advantage of the current hard market. For Boardwalk, the factors that we consider for assessing intrinsic value, our EBITDA free cash flow, natural gas volumes, the regulatory environment, industrial demand for both gas and gas liquids, the revenue backlog, organic growth potential, along with several other measures and characteristics. We're positive on the natural gas industry, and believe that gas will be an important transition fuel for a greener economy. When we think about Loews Hotels, we consider adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, comparable asset valuations and occupancy and room rates. Loews Hotels has a unique business model since it's both an owner and an operator of its hotel properties. This differentiator has enabled Loews Hotels to successfully compete for attractive projects over demand -- near demand generators, such as Orlando, Arlington, Texas. Although the hotel industry has been hard hit by COVID, we believe that Loews Hotels is uniquely positioned to succeed in a post COVID world. And finally, for Altium, we primarily look at organic volume growth, EBITDA and cash flow as well as the company's ability to make accretive acquisitions in diversified end markets. Since we purchased Altium, the company has made 7 accretive acquisitions at compelling multiples that have diversified our businesses into higher growth end markets, such as pharma. These factors are just the beginning of how we come to our assessment of each of our subsidiaries intrinsic value. Additionally, we assess the business' management team, the company's competitive position within its industry and the long-term outlook for each of those industries."

CNA's Board declared a $0.75 special dividend increased its common dividend by $0.01 to $0.38 per share. The increase in the common dividend is reflective of the CNA Board's confidence in the company's ongoing operational improvements. The reduction in the special dividends reflects events of 2020 that reduced CNA's earnings. 2020 was a terrible year for the insurance industry. With the impact of COVID hurricanes with civil unrest, the industry experienced unprecedented cat losses. In spite of all that, though, CNA came through the year very well. One of our highest priorities is for CNA to retain its rock-solid capital position. Heading into 2021, we think that CNA is setting up for a very good year. Operationally and financially, CNA ended 2020 very strong with a continuing hard market. Rate increases are robust, retentions are good, and there's solid new business generation. All this points to 2021 being a much more successful year for CNA than 2020."

And I think many people on the call have heard this before. We can invest in our existing subsidiaries. We can make an acquisition. We can repurchase our shares or, as I like to say, if there's nothing to do, we can do nothing. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have been almost compelling capital allocation option. As I said in my remarks, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of investing in any of our subsidiaries. For example, we've provided capital to those hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on its business. Our 3 other subsidiaries, C&A, Boardwalk and Altium Package have not recently required current company capital. And in fact, they've returned capital to the parent company. In terms of adding a new subsidiary, I think valuations are still too damn high. When buying a new business, there's no amount of due diligence that we can do that will result in the same knowledge that we have of our own businesses. And considering where evaluations are today, when you compare allocating capital towards a new business, we're buying in shares when our stock is trading so far below of our view of its intrinsic value. Well, it's really a no-brainer. When we think about allocating capital, we really think of it from the perspective of a shareholder. After all, management's interests are totally aligned with those of our shareholders since senior management has significant shareholdings and the Tish family overall owns about 1/3 of the company."

The economic aftershocks of the pandemic have caused revenue at those hotels to decline precipitously, both Jim and I mentioned that in our prepared remarks. If one looks just at the last 3 quarters of 2020, operating revenue was down 86% from 2019. The 3 main drivers of Loews Hotels business, leisure travel, business travel and group meetings were all stopped in their tracks by COVID. Leisure travel is slowly returning mainly in drive end markets for our resort properties. Loews Hotels responded to the sudden downturn by temporarily suspending operations at all but 4 of its properties, and taking tough actions to reduce property level and management company expenses. Early on, the hotel company established programs to assist it affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund and continuing to provide medical insurance benefits for furlough team members for extended time frames. Additionally, in solidarity with Loews Hotels team members, the 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, John and Andrew Tisch, reduced their 2020 salaries by 50% in their 2020 bonuses by the same amount. As properties began resuming operations in May, the company put in place significantly enhanced safety and well-being standards and protocols for team members and guests. 
Now let me comment on the hotel company's cash flow. On our first quarter earnings call, I noted that as long as operations were almost completely suspended. The hotel company would likely have negative cash flow of about $25 million monthly. I also noted that management intended to reopen properties only when doing so, improved earnings and cash flow. As anticipated, cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been aggressively managed, and capital spending has been rightsized. Today, 22 out of 27 properties are operating, albeit at depressed occupancy rates. The company continues to generate negative cash flow, although significantly better than the $25 million per month cited in early May. 
During 2020, the Loews parent company contributed $151 million of cash to Loews Hotels to fund working capital and other capital needs. We will contribute cash again in '21 for working capital to fund operations. Although, we expect such amounts to be less than in 2020 because of the company's improved cash flow. We also expect the contributions to be skewed toward the first half of the year. One last note. If financially attractive hotel development opportunities surface in 2021, we would certainly consider helping Loews hotels fund them. Back to you, Mary."

At year-end 2020, the CNA portfolio had a market value of about $50 billion. It had an average credit rating of single A, and had net unrealized gain of about $5.7 billion. Additionally, 89% of the portfolio is made up of fixed maturity securities,",407,"Sure. At year-end 2020, the CNA portfolio had a market value of about $50 billion. It had an average credit rating of single A, and had net unrealized gain of about $5.7 billion. Additionally, 89% of the portfolio is made up of fixed maturity securities, and 94% of CNA's fixed maturity securities are investment grade. Loews maintains tight coordination with CNA to align the management of the portfolio to CNA's broader strategy. Managing the investment portfolio internally rather than outsourcing its management, gives us a better ability to act on dislocations in markets when they occur. Additionally, we can carefully focus on objectives and constraints, including managing portfolio book yield as well as capital considerations. Almost every year, we have met objectives as agreed upon with CNA with a focus on stability of income as well as outperforming indices across broad asset classes. Our goal is to create stable and growing investment income throughout a balanced risk return approach. We don't focus on hitting home runs.  Our approach is more like moneyball. We hit a lot of singles and don't strike out very often. We try to be opportunistic in the face of market volatility and fluctuations, seeking assets that fit within our risk profile. In the beginning of 2020, we took advantage of market dislocations to reallocate assets into corporate high-grade securities when they were trading at a relatively widespread. In the spring of 2020, the muni market had a dislocation that lasted about a week or so, but we were able to actually put a lot of money to work, and it paid off for CNA by being so quick on the trigger there. We have built parameters around volatility and risk with a focus on consistent returns. For example, we maintained single issue position limits by rating, which generally speaking, keep us from being hurt by surprises in the credit world. These credit limits result in a diversified portfolio that has served CNA very well. I also want to comment briefly on the short squeeze of game stock and other stocks that resulted in losses for several hedge funds. In late 2018, we began to rebalance CNA's alternatives portfolio, meaningfully reducing hedge fund investments. Over the last 3 years, CNA has reduced its investments in hedge funds by half. And as of year-end 2020, the portfolio only had about $800 million invested in hedge funds. We expect these funds to report normal January returns."

Altium had an excellent year with record operating revenues of more than $1 billion, up almost 10% from 2019. The revenue increase came from several areas, mainly the full year impact of 2019 acquisitions, including Altium health care, stellar performance from the recycled plastics business, organic volume growth and new business and higher year-over-year resin prices passed through to customers on a lagged basis. The company also posted record EBITDA and cash flow. When we acquired what was then consolidated container in 2017, a key plank of our thesis related to tuck-in acquisitions. We saw a fragmented industry, numerous targets and the opportunity for purchasing and expense synergies. In November, Altium completed its seventh acquisition under our ownership. A privately held company specializing in the blow molding of industrial containers. This acquisition had only a small impact on 2020 revenue, but will benefit all of '21. Acquisitions completed in 2019 accounted for about 70% of Altium's 2020 revenue growth. Altium Healthcare, the company's pharmaceutical packaging business acquired in June of 2019, led the charge. Altium continues to look for accretive tuck-in acquisitions to add further scale and diversification. Altium had record new business awards in 2020 as the company's reputation for reliability, innovation and customer service, continue to differentiate Altium in the market. This new business will mainly benefit revenue in 2021 and beyond. 
Envision, the company's recycled plastics arm had its best performance in 2020 since Altium acquired the business in 2014. Demand for recycled plastic has been robust, as Altium's end markets focus more and more on sustainability. In January, Altium recapitalized its debt structure, replacing its roughly $850 million of debt with a new $1.05 billion 7-year term loan. The deal priced strongly at LIBOR plus 2.75 with a 50 basis point LIBOR floor. The recapitalization raises Altium's interest expense only very slightly and should not impair its ability to grow organically or execute tuck in deals. Altium's key bank credit ratios are essentially in line with or slightly better than they were when Loews acquired the company. Loews received $199 million dividend last week out of the excess proceeds, representing the return of about 1/3 of our initial equity investment. We posted on our website this morning, the lender presentation used in conjunction with Altium's term loan financing. The presentation includes both business and financial information about the company, and we hope you find it helpful. Thanks, Mary."

First off, the administration's climate agenda has created some new risks for the natural gas sector by implementing a pause on new natural gas leases on federal lands and also on offshore waters. In my view, natural gas is an important transition fuel to cleaner energy in the U.S., and it's also a growing export opportunity to help the rest of the world meet their similar climate change goals. The recent executive orders, in my mind, are a troubling sign of new federal restrictions that may make it more difficult to access this plentiful American resource. Additionally, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that regulates Boardwalk is changing. While it's too early to know exactly what impact these changes will be we'll have, we believe that there will continue to be increased pressure on the industry's ability to build pipelines. However, the administration's focus on the environment could be beneficial for Envision Altium's packaging, recycled resin business as well as for Dura Lite, the plastic packaging Altium has designed that uses significantly less resin without compromising the strength of the container. Certainly, the Biden administration's focus on stemming the tide of the virus should be beneficial to Loews Hotels and help increase demand for the travel and tourism industry. While our largest subsidiary CNA is mostly regulated through the states, the new administration and Congress pose some policy challenges and opportunities. For example, changes to the corporate tax code would affect lows in our subsidiaries, but such changes aren't expected until later in the year when there is more evidence of economic recovery. And from what we understand corporate taxes probably will not go back to the pre-2017 levels. We're going to continue to watch these issues as they develop. It's only been a few weeks now, and we've just got to wait and see what happens."

The coronavirus changed our lives with astonishing speed, and what began as a promising year quickly and dramatically morphed into a global health and economic crisis. In addi",1380,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. 2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges. The coronavirus changed our lives with astonishing speed, and what began as a promising year quickly and dramatically morphed into a global health and economic crisis. In addition to the harsh toll on human lives and livelihoods, the pandemic has brought about changes in society and business that are likely to be felt for years to come.
Before I speak about Loews, I want to acknowledge and to thank everyone on the front lines of the fight against this pandemic, especially the medical professionals, the first responders and people in every industry who are risking their own safety to provide essential products and safety. While we can never sufficiently express our gratitude for their bravery and their compassion, Loews and our subsidiaries have provided philanthropic support to various organizations supplying relief and aiding recovery efforts in their community.
We also want to recognize our Loews' corporate and subsidiary employees, who rose through this ongoing challenge with determination, focus and professionalism. Across the organization, our people have done their part to make sure that businesses had insurance and claims were paid, that natural gas was available to heat homes, schools and medical facilities. Our packaging was available for water and medicine bottles or that a meal was delivered to a family in a hotel room. Each of our subsidiaries went to impressive lengths to ensure the health and safety of their employees and customers. These efforts enabled us to meet the needs of our customers and communities at a critical time while continuing to move Loews forward.
Let's look at the operational impact of COVID on each of our subsidiaries over the course of 2020, starting with CNA. Operationally, CNA's performance continues to be quite strong. While the events of 2020 were unprecedented, including impacts not only from COVID, but also from civil unrest and hurricanes, the overall trend in the property casualty insurance industry has been upwards towards a hardening market.
Not only did CNA have good growth in new business, the company also benefited from higher P&C rates, leading to higher overall premium growth. Throughout the year, CNA has continued to focus on underwriting discipline, partnerships and talent. This focus has resulted in continued improvements in CNA's underlying performance, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year development.
In 2020, CNA had an underlying combined ratio of 93.1% compared to 94.8% in 2019 and 95.4% in 2018. That represents a more than 2-point improvement over 2 years, reflecting progress in both the expense and loss ratios. Earlier today, CNA declared a special dividend of $0.75 in addition to raising its quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share. The increase in the common dividend is reflective of the CNA Board's confidence in the ongoing operational improvements at CNA.
CNA paid total dividends of around 90% of its 2020 earnings. CNA's ability to return capital to shareholders even after the extensive cat losses the company absorbed this year, underscores its financial strength and fortress balance sheet.
At Boardwalk in 2020, the company met the challenge of operating its pipelines without service interruptions to its customers, not only during COVID-19, but also through the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast. Boardwalk has completed the recontracting of its pipelines originally put into service between 2008 and 2010. While future growth projects could become more difficult to green light in the current environment, Boardwalk continues to benefit from its long-term fixed fee contracts.
During 2020, the company added approximately $1.3 billion of new contracts and the contractual backlog ended the year at over $9 billion or 7x Boardwalk's annual 2020 revenues. Boardwalk reported EBITDA of $819 million for the year, essentially flat from 2019.
As for our packaging company, Altium, demand for its products continues to be strong overall and even stronger for product segments such as household chemicals and beverages. On the flip side, as a result of the pandemic, demand is somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial foodservice and school dairy. Additionally, the company's recycling business envision has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014, driven by stronger demand for recycled product, also known as post-consumer resin.
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company continues to be successful in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.
Of all our subsidiaries, Loews Hotels has been the hardest hit by the pandemic. In February, the company had occupancy rates of around 80% for its owned and joint venture hotels. By April, only 3 of these hotels were operational and occupancy rates had plummeted to about 9%. The company responded quickly to the COVID-induced downturn in a number of ways. To better align to reduced level of demand, those hotels aggressively cut expenses. They rightsized capital spending, worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns and reevaluated opening dates for new developments.
Importantly, in the face of this crisis, Loews Hotels continue to look out for its team numbers' safety and well-being, putting programs in place to assist those negatively affected as well as implementing extensive COVID protocols in hotels as they resumed operations.
During December of 2020, occupancy rates for owned and JV hotels that were operational had risen to almost 38%, with 22 out of 27 Loews Hotels once again welcoming guests. At this point in time, leisure travel is recovering at a somewhat faster pace than business travel. But it is still difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually and as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic.
That being said, we believe properties such as those in Orlando, Miami Beach and Arlington, Texas, are well positioned to participate in the early stages of the travel resurgence. It bears mentioning that throughout the pandemic, Loews and its subsidiaries continue to have ample access for the capital markets. Loews, CNA and Boardwalk each issued $500 million in bonds between May and August of 2020, taking advantage of the low rates available in the credit markets.
Altium Packaging completed a debt recapitalization in January of 2021, which resulted in a $199 million payment to Loews, basically returning 1/3 of our equity, and we still own 100% of the business. This is our first dividend from Altium since acquiring the company in 2017. The success of these offerings is a testament to the strength of Loews' corporate and subsidiary balance sheets and investors' confidence in our creditworthiness.
Before I hand the call over to David, I want to talk about capital allocation. Throughout this year, I have emphatically stated my strong belief that the market has been significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we would still take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our shares.
With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option. That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. We provided about $150 million to Loews Hotels in 2020 to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. We will continue to support Loews Hotels in 2021 as it prepares for travel and tourism to come back with the expectation of a return to more normalized operations in 2022.
During the fourth quarter, we purchased almost 6 million shares of Loews stock for about $244 million, while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash. Over the course of the year, Loews repurchased nearly 22 million of our own shares for an average cost of below $42 per share, which is lower than Loews' current market price and considerably lower than what we believe to be the intrinsic value of the company.
In my view, that's a great use of capital in order to create value for all shareholders over the long term.
And now, David, over to you."

For the full year, we reported a net loss of $",1442,"Thank you very much, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $397 million or $1.45 per share compared to $217 million or $0.73 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported a net loss of $931 million or $3.32 per share. While in 2019, our net income was $932 million or $3.07 per share.
I will briefly summarize our strong fourth quarter results and then turn to the full year. CNA drove the year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter income with an assist from Boardwalk. The absence of results from Diamond Offshore, which last year posted a fourth quarter loss, also helped.
Let me share some highlights on CNA's fourth quarter. For more details, check out the transcript from today's CNA investor call. CNA's net income contribution to Loews rose 42% to $346 million, making up the bulk of our consolidated fourth quarter net income of $398 million. The core P&C business performed extremely well. Net written premium grew 12% year-over-year, thanks to robust new business, together with rate increases averaging over 12%. The combined ratio improved 2.1 points to 93.5, driven by lower expense and underlying loss ratios as well as reduced cat losses.
After-tax P&C net investment income was down slightly as higher returns on LP and common stock investments were not able to fully offset the impact of lower yields on the fixed income portfolio. Net investment gains, however, were greater than during the prior year quarter. The Life & Group segment posted strong results, thanks principally to favorable morbidity trends in the long-term care block.
Boardwalk pipeline's net income contribution rose from $48 million in last year's fourth quarter to $83 million, which included $26 million after-tax of settlement proceeds related to a customer bankruptcy. Fourth quarter net revenues, excluding these proceeds, were up 4%, driven by growth projects recently placed into service. Loews Hotels posted a net loss of $68 million in Q4 2020 versus a net loss last year of $59 million. This year's net loss was caused by the continuing revenue challenges stemming from the pandemic, with operating revenue down 81% year-over-year. In last year's fourth quarter, Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of 2 hotel properties as well as some preopening expenses on properties under development.
Before turning to the full year, one last observation on the quarterly comparison. The fourth quarter of 2019 included a $38 million net loss from Diamond Offshore. Diamond is no longer one of our consolidated subsidiaries, and thus did not affect our Q4 2020 earnings.
Now for our full year results. We reported a net loss of $931 million or $3.32 per share. Let me start by recapping the drivers of the loss, which primarily relate to Diamond and Loews Hotels. Diamond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 26, 2020. Through that date, Diamond had contributed net losses of $476 million to Loews, mainly attributable to rig impairment charges. Further, because of the bankruptcy filing, in the second quarter, we deconsolidated Diamond, wrote down the carrying value of our investment in the company and booked a $957 million after-tax investment loss. In total, Diamond accounted for $1.43 billion of net losses to Loews in 2020.
Loews Hotels has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with operating revenue down 71% for the full year. Similarly, income in joint ventures swung from positive $69 million in 2019 to a $73 million loss in 2020. This dramatic change in Loews Hotels operating environment caused the company to incur a net loss of $212 million for the year. Loews' net income declined even after entirely excluding the impact of Diamond and Loews Hotels from our results in both years. This decline was entirely attributable to higher catastrophe losses at CNA and lower results from investment-related activities at CNA and the parent company.
CNA booked pretax catastrophe losses of $550 million in 2020, up from $179 million in 2019. Weather-related events comprised 53% of the year's cat losses with COVID-19 and civil unrest, making up the remainder. The negative year-over-year impact to Loews of CNA's unusually elevated catastrophe losses was $262 million after tax. After-tax net investment income in CNA's P&C business fell year-over-year because of lower returns on fixed income securities and limited partnership and common stock investments. This accounted for $148 million decline in Loews' net income.
Similarly, the Loews parent company's net investment income declined $141 million after tax, driven mainly by lower returns on LP and equity investments. Finally, CNA swung from net investment gains in 2019 to net investment losses in 2020. This swing reduced our net income by $60 million. In total, these items, cat losses, net investment income at CNA and Loews and CNA's net investment losses accounted for a year-over-year decline in Loews' net income of $611 million. Thankfully, there were numerous positives during 2020 worth highlighting.
CNA's core P&C business, excluding catastrophes, performed extremely well. Net written premium increased 6% on the back of new business growth, solid retention and rate increases averaging 11%. The underlying combined ratio for the full year, which excludes cat losses and prior year development, was 93.1%, down from 94.8% in 2019, with improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. All of this led to a 38% increase in pretax underlying underwriting income. CNA's long-term care business continues to benefit from active operational and risk management of the block. Even including the impact of this year's active life and claim reserve reviews, the Life & Group business generated positive results, driven by better-than-expected morbidity in long-term care.
CNA's balance sheet remains rock solid. Its decision to pay a $0.75 special dividend, which was announced this morning, is further evidence of CNA's dedication to financial soundness. Moreover, it continues to reduce its risk profile. Most recently with the agreement signed last week to seed a legacy portfolio of excess workers' compensation policies to a subsidiary of Enstar.
Boardwalk had a good year operationally. Net operating revenues, excluding the settlement proceeds from a customer bankruptcy in each year were down less than 1%, reflecting the last vestiges of expirations and renewals at lower rates of long-term contracts put in place 10-plus years ago. The company's growth projects, together with a strong market for storage and park and loan services made up for most of the fall off, and Boardwalk continues to effectively manage its expenses.
Altium Packaging, which is included in our corporate segment, had a strong year operationally, with revenues up almost 10%, driven by organic growth, new business, exceptional results in its recycled plastics business, the full year impact of acquisitions made in 2019 and higher year-over-year resin prices. 2020 was a record year for new business awards for Altium, further highlighting its reputation for quality, reliability, innovation and customer service. As I've mentioned in the past, Altium's results have had little effect to date on our net income. While Altium generates healthy EBITDA and free cash flow, its GAAP income has been weighed down by depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions and accelerated trade name amortization.
Last week, Altium completed a recapitalization, issuing a $1.05 billion 7-year secured term loan, the proceeds of which went to refinance its existing debt, and pay Loews a dividend of $199 million. As Jim mentioned, this is the first distribution Loews has received from Altium since we acquired the company in 2017. Importantly, this transaction in no way hamstrings Altium's ability to continue pursuing tuck-in acquisitions. As a reminder, our initial equity investment in Altium was slightly more than $600 million.
Turning to the parent company. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.5 billion at year-end, with about 77% in cash and equivalents. During the fourth quarter, we received $192 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $90 million from CNA and $102 million from Boardwalk, which represented Boardwalk's only dividend to Loews in 2020.
For the full year, we received total dividends of $947 million from CNA and Boardwalk. Today, CNA declared a 75% -- excuse me, $0.75 per share special dividend and a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share, up $0.01 from $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $275 million in dividends from CNA this quarter as well as the $199 million received from Altium last week. We repurchased 5.8 million shares in the fourth quarter for $244 million and 22 million shares during the full year for $917 million.

So one of the good things about getting the questions in advance is that I can prepare a thoughtful and detailed answers as I have, especially on this one.

So one of the good things about getting the questions in advance is that I can prepare a thoughtful and detailed answers as I have, especially on this one. So we assess Loews' some of the parts value based on our view of the intrinsic value of each of our subsidiaries. Intrinsic value is our view of what our subsidiaries are worth based on our medium- to long-range outlook. And the valuation can and often does differ from the current market value of those enterprises. Our outlook for each subsidiary is informed by our view of the industry in which it operates and then competitive strengths and weaknesses of our subsidiaries. So let's take a look at these subsidiary by subsidiary.
Starting with CNA, the primary indicator is that we look at our core earnings, the combined ratio, we look at earnings per share, dividend capacity, pricing and loss trends. Based on these metrics, we believe CNA is undervalued compared to its peers and even more so compared to the overall markets. We are bullish on the commercially property and casualty insurance industry, and we also believe that CNA will be able to continue to take advantage of the current hard market.
For Boardwalk, the factors that we consider for assessing intrinsic value are EBITDA, free cash flow, natural gas volumes, the regulatory environment, industrial demand for both gas and gas liquids, the revenue backlog, organic growth potential, along with several other measures and characteristics. We're positive on the natural gas industry, and believe that gas will be an important transition fuel for a greener economy. When we think about Loews Hotels, we consider adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, comparable asset valuations and occupancy and room rates. Loews Hotels has a unique business model since it's both an owner and an operator of its hotel properties. This differentiator has enabled Loews Hotels to successfully compete for attractive projects over demand -- near demand generators, such as Orlando, Arlington, Texas.
Although the hotel industry has been hard hit by COVID, we believe that Loews Hotels is uniquely positioned to succeed in a post-COVID world. And finally, for Altium, we primarily look at organic volume growth, EBITDA and cash flow as well as the company's ability to make accretive acquisitions in diversified end markets. Since we purchased Altium, the company has made 7 accretive acquisitions at compelling multiples that have diversified our businesses into higher growth end markets, such as pharma. These factors are just the beginning of how we come to our assessment of each of our subsidiaries' intrinsic value. Additionally, we assess the business' management teams, the company's competitive position within its industry and the long-term outlook for each of those industries."

CNA's Board declared a $0.75 special dividend and increased its common dividend by $0.01 to $0.38 per share. The increase in the common dividend is reflective of the CNA Board's confidence in the company's ongoing operational improvements. The reduction in the special dividends reflects events of 2020 that reduced CNA's earnings. 2020 was a terrible year for the insurance industry. With the impact of COVID, hurricanes with civil unrest, the industry experienced unprecedented cat losses.
In spite of all that, though, CNA came through the year very well. One of our highest priorities is for CNA to retain its rock-solid capital position. Heading into 2021, we think that CNA is setting up for a very good year. Operationally and financially, CNA ended 2020 very strong with a continuing hard market. Rate increases are robust, retentions are good, and there's solid new business generation. All this points to 2021 being a much more successful year for CNA than 2020."

And I think many people on the call have heard this before. We can invest in our existing subsidiaries. We can make an acquisition. We can repurchase our shares or, as I like to say, if there's nothing to do, we can do nothing. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have been almost compelling capital allocation option. As I said in my remarks, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of investing in any of our subsidiaries.
For example, we've provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on its business. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Package have not recently required current company capital. And in fact, they've returned capital to the parent company. In terms of adding a new subsidiary, I think valuations are still too damn high. When buying a new business, there's no amount of due diligence that we can do that will result in the same knowledge that we have of our own businesses. And considering where evaluations are today, when you compare allocating capital towards a new business, we're buying in shares when our stock is trading so far below of our view of its intrinsic value. Well, it's really a no-brainer.
When we think about allocating capital, we really think of it from the perspective of a shareholder. After all, management's interests are totally aligned with those of our shareholders since senior management has significant shareholdings and the Tisch family overall owns about 1/3 of the company."

The economic aftershocks of the pandemic have caused revenue of Loews Hotels to decline precipitously, both Jim and I mentioned that in our prepared remarks. If one looks just at the last 3 quarters of 2020, operating revenue was down 86% from 2019. The 3 main drivers of Loews Hotels business, leisure travel, business travel and group meetings were all stopped in their tracks by COVID. Leisure travel is slowly returning mainly in drive end markets for our resort properties.
Loews Hotels responded to the sudden downturn by temporarily suspending operations at all but 4 of its properties, and taking tough actions to reduce property level and management company expenses. Early on, the hotel company established programs to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund and continuing to provide medical insurance benefits for furloughed team members for extended time frames.
Additionally, in solidarity with Loews Hotels team members, the 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, Jon and Andrew Tisch, reduced their 2020 salaries by 50% and their 2020 bonuses by the same amount. As properties began resuming operations in May, the company put in place significantly enhanced safety and well-being standards and protocols for team members and guests.
Now let me comment on the hotel company's cash flow. On our first quarter earnings call, I noted that as long as operations were almost completely suspended, the hotel company would likely have negative cash flow of about $25 million monthly. I also noted that management intended to reopen properties only when doing so, improved earnings and cash flow. As anticipated, cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations, expenses have been aggressively managed, and capital spending has been rightsized. Today, 22 out of 27 properties are operating, albeit at depressed occupancy rates. The company continues to generate negative cash flow, although significantly better than the $25 million per month cited in early May.
During 2020, the Loews parent company contributed $151 million of cash to Loews Hotels to fund working capital and other capital needs. We will contribute cash again in '21 for working capital to fund operations. Although, we expect such amounts to be less than in 2020 because of the company's improved cash flow. We also expect the contributions to be skewed toward the first half of the year. One last note. If financially attractive hotel development opportunities surface in 2021, we would certainly consider helping Loews Hotels fund them. Back to you, Mary."

It had an average credit rating of single A, and had net unrealized gain of about $5.7 billion. Additionally, 89% of the portfolio is made up of fixed maturity securities, and 94% of CNA's fixed maturity securities are investment grade. Loews maintains tight coordination with CNA to align the management of the portfolio to CNA's broader strategy. Managing the investment portfolio internally rather than outsourcing its management, gives us a better ability to act on dislocations in markets when they occur.
Additionally, we can carefully focus on objectives and constraints, including managing portfolio book yield as well as capital considerations. Almost every year, we have met objectives as agreed upon with CNA with a focus on stability of income as well as outperforming indices across broad asset classes. Our goal is to create stable and growing investment income throughout a balanced risk-return approach. We don't focus on hitting home runs. Our approach is more like moneyball. We hit a lot of singles and don't strike out very often. We try to be opportunistic in the face of market volatility and fluctuations, seeking assets that fit within our risk profile.
In the beginning of 2020, we took advantage of market dislocations to reallocate assets into corporate high-grade securities when they were trading at a relatively widespread. In the spring of 2020, the muni market had a dislocation that lasted about a week or so, but we were able to actually put a lot of money to work, and it paid off for CNA by being so quick on the trigger there. We have built parameters around volatility and risk with a focus on consistent returns.
For example, we maintained single issue position limits by rating, which, generally speaking, keep us from being hurt by surprises in the credit world. These credit limits result in a diversified portfolio that has served CNA very well. I also want to comment briefly on the short squeeze of game stock and other stocks that resulted in losses for several hedge funds. In late 2018, we began to rebalance CNA's alternatives portfolio, meaningfully reducing hedge fund investments. Over the last 3 years, CNA has reduced its investments in hedge funds by half. And as of year-end 2020, the portfolio only had about $800 million invested in hedge funds. We expect these funds to report normal January returns."

Altium had an excellent year with record operating revenues of more than $1 billion, up almost 10% from 2019. The revenue increase came from several areas, mainly the full year impact of 2019 acquisitions, including Altium Healthcare, stellar performance from the recycled plastics business, organic volume growth and new business and higher year-over-year resin prices passed through to customers on a lagged basis. The company also posted record EBITDA and cash flow.
When we acquired what was then consolidated container in 2017, a key plank of our thesis related to tuck-in acquisitions, we saw a fragmented industry, numerous targets and the opportunity for purchasing and expense synergies. In November, Altium completed its seventh acquisition under our ownership. A privately held company specializing in the blow molding of industrial containers. This acquisition had only a small impact on 2020 revenue, but will benefit all of '21.
Acquisitions completed in 2019 accounted for about 70% of Altium's 2020 revenue growth. Altium Healthcare, the company's pharmaceutical packaging business acquired in June of 2019, led the charge. Altium continues to look for accretive tuck-in acquisitions to add further scale and diversification. Altium had record new business awards in 2020 as the company's reputation for reliability, innovation and customer service continue to differentiate Altium in the market. This new business will mainly benefit revenue in 2021 and beyond.
Envision, the company's recycled plastics arm had its best performance in 2020 since Altium acquired the business in 2014. Demand for recycled plastic has been robust, as Altium's end markets focus more and more on sustainability. In January, Altium recapitalized its debt structure, replacing its roughly $850 million of debt with a new $1.05 billion 7-year term loan. The deal priced strongly at LIBOR plus 2.75 with a 50 basis point LIBOR floor. The recapitalization raises Altium's interest expense only very slightly and should not impair its ability to grow organically or execute tuck-in deals.
Altium's key bank credit ratios are essentially in line with or slightly better than they were when Loews acquired the company. Loews received $199 million dividend last week out of the excess proceeds, representing the return of about 1/3 of our initial equity investment. We posted on our website this morning, the lender presentation used in conjunction with Altium's term loan financing. The presentation includes both business and financial information about the company, and we hope you find it helpful."

First off, the administration's climate agenda has created some new risks for the natural gas sector by implementing a pause on new natural gas leases on federal lands and also on offshore waters. In my view, natural gas is an important transition fuel to cleaner energy in the U.S., and it's also a growing export opportunity to help the rest of the world meet their similar climate change goals.
The recent executive orders, in my mind, are a troubling sign of new federal restrictions that may make it more difficult to access this plentiful American resource. Additionally, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that regulates Boardwalk is changing. While it's too early to know exactly what impact these changes will be -- will have, we believe that there will continue to be increased pressure on the industry's ability to build pipelines. However, the administration's focus on the environment could be beneficial for Envision, Altium's packaging, recycled resin business as well as for Dura-Lite, the plastic packaging Altium has designed that uses significantly less resin without compromising the strength of the container.
Certainly, the Biden administration's focus on stemming the tide of the virus should be beneficial to Loews Hotels and help increase demand for the travel and tourism industry. While our largest subsidiary, CNA, is mostly regulated through the states, the new administration and Congress pose some policy challenges and opportunities. For example, changes to the corporate tax code would affect Loews and our subsidiaries, but such changes aren't expected until later in the year when there is more evidence of economic recovery. And from what we understand corporate taxes probably will not go back to their pre-2017 levels. We're going to continue to watch these issues as they develop. It's only been a few weeks now, and we've just got to wait and see what happens."

What a difference a year makes? 12 months ago, we were all facing tremendous uncertainty about the future. A year later, while the personal, social, and economic effects of COVID-19 are still impacting each of us individually and collectively, the outlook at Loews has significantly improved. Each of our subsidiaries has been affected differently by the pandemic, but across the board, their responses have been extraordinary, and each business has found its footing in 2021. 
First, let's look at our largest subsidiary CNA. The company's operational strength and resilience is evident, not only in its underlying combined ratio and rate increases, but also in its ability to respond nimbly to ongoing challenges. In the first quarter, CNA did experience higher than usual cap losses from what I call the Texas freeze off, but its basic business continued to perform well. CNA's underlying combined ratio of 91.9 improved nearly 2 points over the prior year quarter of 93.7, with a 1.6 percentage point improvement in the expense ratio. Rate continues to be strong with an 11% increase in the quarter. 
CNA's investment portfolio ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in unrealized gains, down from a high of $5.7 billion last quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates. Over the long term, higher interest rates will be beneficial to CNA, allowing it to invest its cash flow at higher rates than today's. 
Boardwalk Pipelines has substantial operations in Texas, but the February storm had little financial impact on the company. Boardwalk's revenues slightly increased due to higher system utilization during the freeze off, as was the case with other companies in the natural gas transportation industry. The company's solid performance during this crisis was not a lucky accident, rather, it was a result of significant preparation, planning and hard work by the Boardwalk team. The company's considerable efforts paid off and [Audio Gap] in the first quarter of 2021 was due to growth projects that have been placed into service and the colder winter weather. 
Of all our subsidiaries, Loews Hotels has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. However, as travel picks up across the country, we are seeing gradual progress at Loews Hotels, especially at the company's resort destinations. By the end of the first quarter of '21, 23 of the company's 27 hotels were open. And further good news, the company expects to have hotels open in all its markets by the end of the second quarter. Comparing the first quarter of 2021 to the final quarter of 2020, we saw continued improvement in trends. The average daily room rate of our owned and JV hotels that are open increased by 25% to $234. 
Leisure travel continues to improve at a faster pace than business travel, and while we expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, occupancy at hotels should increase gradually as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Loews Hotels has an ownership interest in nearly 15,000 rooms, approximately 11,000 of which are located in resort destinations. So we think that Loews Hotels is well positioned to benefit from this leisure led recovery. 
When acquiring a subsidiary, our long-term goal is to have that subsidiary return capital to Loews when the time is appropriate. Loews acquired at Altium in 2017 for $1.2 billion, that was $600 million in equity and $600 million in debt at the LTM level. In February of 2021, Altium refinanced its term loans and replaced its roughly $850 million of debt with a new $1.5 billion, 7-year term loan, allowing the company to pay $200 million dividend to Loews. And a month later, on April 1, Loews sold a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, a Singapore Wealth Fund, for gross cash proceeds of $422 million. With these 2 transactions, Loews has recouped its entire initial investment in Altium, while still retaining a 53% ownership interest in the company. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, we felt the time was right for us to monetize a portion of Loews' ownership stake in Altium. We believe strongly in the long-term prospects of Altium's business, and it's our opinion that the Altium management team is second to none in the industry. 
By retaining a majority ownership position, Loews will be able to capitalize on the future growth trajectory of the company. Additionally, we have gained a strong and like-minded partner in GIC. Under the new ownership structure, Altium has increased its financial flexibility when it comes to larger acquisitions.
Finally, so far in 2021, Loews has purchased more than 6,150,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $49.58 per share, for a total of $305 million, representing 2.3% of our outstanding shares.

285930,711973928,2267031,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 03, 2021",2021-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net los",1401,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net loss had 2 main drivers. One, investment results at CNA and the Loews parent company, stemming from financial market disruptions as the pandemic spread; and second, risk -- rig impairments at our former consolidated subsidiary, Diamond Offshore.
This year's first quarter benefited from dramatically improved investment results at CNA and the parent company, strong P&C underwriting income at CNA, before catastrophe losses and favorable results posted by Boardwalk Pipelines. Also, the year-over-year comparison benefited from the absence of losses from Diamond Offshore.
Conversely, losses at Loews Hotels reduced quarterly results, as the pandemic continued to mute travel and thus, hotel demand. Additionally, earnings in the Corporate segment were reduced by some items related to Altium, our packaging subsidiary.
Let me get into more detail about the quarter. CNA contributed net income of $279 million, up dramatically from a $55 million net loss in Q1 2020. The year-over-year turnaround was driven primarily by investment results, both net investment income and net investment gains. But before I discuss investment results, I wanted to highlight CNA's continued solid property casualty underwriting performance.
CNA's core property casualty business posted terrific underwriting results before catastrophe losses. Net earned premium was up almost 6% year-over-year and the combined ratio, excluding CAT losses, was 91.3%, 1.7 points better than last year's first quarter and 1.1 points better than full year 2020. The loss ratio, excluding CATs, was 59.5%, an excellent result that was in line with last year's first quarter and with full year 2020.
I would note that prior development was comparable this year and last, with less than 1 point of favorable development in both periods. CNA's expense ratio, which, together with the loss ratio makes up the combined ratio, declined to 31.5%, which was 1.6 points better than in Q1, 2020. The company's expense ratio improvement is notable and results from both expense management and premium growth. As a historical footnote, the company's expense ratio in, say, 2017 was over 34%. So you can see how far CNA has come in a few short years.
Catastrophe losses, however, were elevated during this year's first quarter thanks largely to winter storms and in Texas. CNA booked 6.8 points of CAT losses in Q1, up from 4.3 points in last year's first quarter. As a result, the company's overall combined ratio was up slightly to 98.1 from 97.3 last year. I would highlight that CNA's Q1 CAT losses were essentially in line with its market share in the affected areas.
CNA's after-tax net investment income increased $133 million or 48% from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for the entire improvement. The S&P 500 returned 6.2% in this year's first quarter as compared to a negative 19.6% total return in Q1 of last year.
The turnaround in CNA's net investment gains was substantial, swinging from net pretax investment losses of $216 million in Q1 '20 to investment gains of $57 million in Q1 '21. Last year's large losses were mainly attributable to market value declines of nonredeemable preferred stock as well as impairment losses on corporate bonds.
Taken together, the uplift in CNA's net investment income and the turnaround in its net investment gains benefited Loews' year-over-year net income by $306 million. In summary, CNA's investment and non-CAT underwriting results were strong during the quarter with CNA and its peers, impacted by an unusually high level of natural catastrophes.
Boardwalk posted an over 8% increase in net revenue and a net income contribution of $85 million, up from $65 million in last year's first quarter.
Turning to Loews Hotels. While the company continues to suffer from the COVID-induced downturn in travel, business is gradually improving, as Jim described. The company posted a net loss of $43 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $25 million in Q1 '20. GAAP operating revenue was $39 million, down from $109 million last year, and the pretax equity loss from joint venture properties was $12 million as opposed to a $4 million loss last year.
In last year's first quarter, business was quite strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter. So precipitously, in fact, that most properties suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. To provide a comparative sense of the hotel company's results, let's look at adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and reconciled in our earnings supplement. It includes all properties and excludes nonrecurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61 million in Q1 of 2019, declined to $17 million in Q1 of 2020, and was a loss of $13 million in this year's first quarter. The low point for profitability was last year's second quarter when Loews Hotels posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA has improved steadily since that low point as business has steadily come back.
For a good snapshot of this operational improvement, I would encourage you to review Page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement, which shows the increase in available rooms occupancy and average daily rate since Q2 last year. We currently expect absent any divestitures or development projects to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million in 2021, down materially from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow. During the first quarter, we invested $32 million in Loews Hotels. 
Turning to the Corporate segment. The parent company's investment portfolio generated net pretax income of $46 million as compared to a loss of $166 million last year. Like at CNA, equities and alternatives led the decline last year and the rebound this year. The remainder of the Corporate sector generated a $75 million pretax and $106 million after-tax loss in the quarter. Two main factors, both connected to Altium, drove this larger-than-normal loss.
One, Altium undertook a recapitalization during the quarter, refinancing its existing term loans with a single $1.05 billion term loan. The company booked a $14 million pretax debt extinguishment charge in connection with the recap. And second, the sale of a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, which was pending at quarter end, required Loews to book a $35 million deferred tax liability, which impacted net income, but not pretax income.
Diamond Offshore materially affected our year-over-year earnings comparison, given Diamond's $452 million net loss in last year's first quarter, driven largely by rig impairments. Diamond was consolidated effective April 26, 2020, and had no impact on our results this past quarter.
A few words about the parent company. As always, we remain determined to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $274 million, and we received about $274 million in dividends from CNA in the quarter, including the $0.38 regular quarterly dividend and the $0.75 special dividend. We also received, as Jim mentioned, a $199 million dividend from Altium, pursuant to its recapitalization. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.6 billion at quarter end, with about 80% in cash and equivalents. After quarter end, we received about $410 million in net proceeds from the sale of 47% of Altium, and have repurchased another 599,000 shares of common stock for about $32 million.
Finally, let me clarify some details relating to the sale of a stake in Altium to GIC. The transaction price implied a total enterprise value of $2 billion for the company and a total equity value of about $900 million. As a reminder, we purchased the company for a total enterprise value of $1.2 billion in 2017 and have not invested any additional capital in Altium since the acquisition. In the second quarter, upon deconsolidation, we will book a net pretax gain of approximately $560 million, which reflects both the net realized gain on the stake sold to GIC and the unrealized gain on our retained 53% stake. The 53% stake will be held as an equity investment in a nonconsolidated subsidiary at approximately $475 million, reflecting the valuation implied by the price paid by GIC for its 47% stake. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Through Altium's dividend recap in February of this year, and then with the sale of a 47% stake of the company to GIC, the Singapore Wealth Fund, we have recouped our entire initial equity investment in Altium. And we still own 53% of the company, which allows us to be able to participate in the company's future growth.
So we fully believe in Altium's long-term prospects. And I think the management team at Altium is truly top-notch. And we've also added a strong partner in GIC and the new ownership structure provides financial flexibility for Altium, especially if they pursue larger acquisitions."

So the impact of February winter storm in Texas was devastating for the people of Texas, leaving many people without power or heat for the duration of the storm. The Boardwalk team did an incredible job, though, due in large part to many planning hours that were dedicated to the preparation for such an event. And as a result, the company was ready to deliver gas to customers on time during and after the storm. Through careful operational management and increased staffing in a number of key areas, Boardwalk was able to successfully meet their customers' need for gas despite low inflows into the Boardwalk Pipelines system. As was with the rest of the area, the Boardwalk system faced historically low temperatures and widespread power outages, but was able to continue operating on backup power when necessary. So they really performed admirably during that event."

Loews Hotels cash flow has improved materially since the onset of the pandemic. Properties have resumed operations, management company and property level expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment.
The low point in Loews Hotels results was last year's second quarter, when GAAP revenue was just $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $54 million. During this year's first quarter, GAAP revenue was $39 million, and the adjusted EBITDA loss had been shrunk to just $13 million.
And as I noted in my remarks, the table on Page 11 of our earnings supplement does show how available rooms occupancy and average daily rate have all increased quite markedly from last year's second quarter.
Now as a reminder, in terms of cash, during all of last year, the Loews parent company contributed net cash of just over $150 million to Loews Hotels. For 2021, the year we're currently in, we currently expect, absent any divestitures or development projects, to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million. This is down materially, of course, from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow at Loews Hotels. And we've contributed in the first quarter, $32 million to the company.
Overall, travel is picking up. Confidence is growing as vaccination rates increase both domestically and internationally. While business travel and group meetings have yet to gain real momentum, leisure travel to resort destinations, in particular, has picked up and is driving Loews Hotels' evolving rebound. And as Jim mentioned, with so many of its rooms located in resort destinations, such as Orlando and Miami Beach, Loews Hotels is well positioned to continue benefiting as we move through the spring into the summer.

So in my opinion, the economy is doing very well, thank you. There's enormous pent-up consumer demand and with the combination of government stimulus and vaccines, that will add yet more fuel to this fire in the economy, this growth in the economy. For many in the middle and upper income classes, there was very little to spend on during the lockdowns. There was no travel. There were no restaurants. There was no entertainment other than Netflix. And the savings rates for the past year has been at all-time highs at close to 20%, which is extraordinary, considering that the norm is about 7.5%.
In our hotel business, we're seeing the beginnings of the increase in travel. In some areas, one of the chief constraints to increasing our occupancy rate is staffing. Staffing is also a constraint in our packaging subsidiary, Altium. So what I can foresee are double-digit increases in GDP, driven by consumer demand, but I can also see significant inflation coming from 2 very distinct sources. The first source is cost push inflation. Especially at the lower end of the pay grade, I see significant increases in wages needed to get people back on to the job. As I said, we're having trouble finding people to work at Altium, and likewise, Loews Hotels, and to combat that, there's been serious increases in wages.
The other thing that's adding to the cost push inflation is that commodities of all sorts are breaking out on the upside. There's copper, there's corn, iron ore, wood, lumber, you name it, commodities are rallying. So businesses are experiencing a lot of increases in their inputs into what they sell.
The second part of the inflation story, in my mind, comes from the demand pull inflation. I see -- I foresee significant consumer inflation coming from the easing of the pandemic and people making up for a lost year last year of spending. So inflation that was 1.5% to 2%, in my opinion, could be significantly higher in the coming years, because of the dramatic increase in demand, combined with the dramatic increase in costs at businesses.
So with this as my base, for the life of me, I don't understand what the Fed and what the Biden administration are doing. Let's start with the Fed. They've got their heads in the sand, in my opinion. The economy is starting to boom, yet we have 0% short-term interest rates, 0%, and inflation is moving up. And they're still managing -- the Fed is still managing both medium and long-term rates. So that 10-year notes are now under 1 60. Inflation is significantly over that and typically, 10-year notes traded at 200 to 300 basis point premium to inflation. So as a result, no one wants to own term treasury securities. And in fact, the only people who are buying them are people who need to own them, for example, insurance companies that have to have fixed income securities. And the other major, major purchaser of those securities is the Fed itself. My fear -- my fear is that the Fed is keeping the proverbial punch ball out for the revelers for much too long. In fact, they've said that, that's exactly what they're doing. The Fed said that. And to me, it seems crazy.
With respect to fiscal policy, there are so many trillion-dollar proposals out there that I can't keep them straight. In Washington, D.C., modern monetary theory is the new paradigm. Modern monetary theory says that basically, deficits don't matter. That the government can spend whatever it wants. My view, these politicians and economists are truly kidding themselves. We as a nation are in an extended sugar high that is being elongated by the Fed and the administration's policies, and I'm concerned that at some point down the road, we, as a nation, are going to have to pay a serious price for it.
So just to sum up, as a result of increased consumer demand coming out of the pandemic and also the dramatically increasing government spending, and as I mentioned, the cost push pressures and also the demand pull pressures, as a result of all of these factors, I see very strong growth for at least the next several quarters, combined with relatively high inflation, which makes me bearish on intermediate and long-term interest rates.
So Mary, that's -- that's a brief summary of my view of where we are in the economy and where I see it going."

What a difference a year makes? 12 months ago, we were all facing tremendous uncertainty about the future. A year later, while the personal, social, and economic effects of COVID-19 are still impacting each of us individually and collectively, the outlook of Loews has significantly improved. Each of our subsidiaries has been affected differently by the pandemic. But across the board, their responses have been extraordinary, and each business has found its footing in 2021.
First, let's look at our largest subsidiary CNA. The company's operational strength and resilience is evident, not only in its underlying combined ratio and rate increases, but also in its ability to respond nimbly to ongoing challenges. In the first quarter, CNA did experience higher than usual cap losses from what I call the Texas freeze off, but its basic business continued to perform well. CNA's underlying combined ratio of 91.9% improved nearly 2 points over the prior year quarter of 93.7%, with a 1.6 percentage point improvement in the expense ratio. Rate continues to be strong with an 11% increase in the quarter.
CNA's investment portfolio ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in unrealized gains, down from a high of $5.7 billion last quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates. Over the long term, higher interest rates will be beneficial to CNA, allowing it to invest its cash flow at higher rates than today.
Boardwalk Pipelines has substantial operations in Texas, but the February storm had little financial impact on the company. Boardwalk's revenues slightly increased due to higher system utilization during the freeze off, as was the case with other companies in the natural gas transportation industry. The company's solid performance during this crisis was not a lucky accident, rather, it was a result of significant preparation, planning and hard work by the Boardwalk team.
The company's considerable efforts paid off and Boardwalk was able to deliver gas to its customers with minimal disruption. Boardwalk's revenue increase to $370 million in the first quarter of 2021 was due to growth projects that have been placed into service and the colder winter weather.
Of all our subsidiaries, Loews Hotels has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. However, as travel picks up across the country, we are seeing gradual progress at Loews Hotels, especially at the company's resort destinations.
By the end of the first quarter of '21, 23 of the company's 27 hotels were open. And further good news, the company expects to have hotels open in all its markets by the end of the second quarter. Comparing the first quarter of 2021 to the final quarter of 2020, we saw continued improvement in trends. The average daily room rate of our owned and JV hotels that are open increased by 25% to $234.
Leisure travel continues to improve at a faster pace than business travel, and while we expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, occupancy at hotels should increase gradually as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Loews Hotels has an ownership interest in nearly 15,000 rooms, approximately 11,000 of which are located in resort destinations. So we think that Loews Hotels is well positioned to benefit from this leisure-led recovery.
When acquiring a subsidiary, our long-term goal is to have that subsidiary return capital to Loews when the time is appropriate. Loews acquired Altium in 2017 for $1.2 billion, that was $600 million in equity and $600 million in debt at the LTM level. In February of 2021, Altium refinanced its term loans and replaced its roughly $850 million of debt with a new $1.5 billion, 7-year term loan, allowing the company to pay $200 million dividend to Loews. And a month later, on April 1, Loews sold a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, a Singapore Wealth Fund, for gross cash proceeds of $422 million.
With these 2 transactions, Loews has recouped its entire initial investment in Altium, while still retaining a 53% ownership interest in the company. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, we felt the time was right for us to monetize a portion of Loews' ownership stake in Altium. We believe strongly in the long-term prospects of Altium's business, and it's our opinion that the Altium management team is second to none in the industry.  
By retaining a majority ownership position, Loews will be able to capitalize on the future growth trajectory of the company. Additionally, we have gained a strong and like-minded partner in GIC. Under the new ownership structure, Altium has increased its financial flexibility when it comes to larger acquisitions.
Finally, so far in 2021, Loews has purchased more than 6,150,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $49.58 per share for a total of $305 million, representing 2.3% of our outstanding shares. Many a time, you've heard me to low on the discount at which Loews trades. So I'll spare you the ramp this time and just let our repurchase activity speak for itself.
David, over to you."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net los",1403,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net loss had 2 main drivers. One, investment results at CNA and the Loews parent company, stemming from financial market disruptions as the pandemic spread; and second, risk -- rig impairments at our former consolidated subsidiary, Diamond Offshore.
This year's first quarter benefited from dramatically improved investment results at CNA and the parent company, strong P&C underwriting income at CNA before catastrophe losses and favorable results posted by Boardwalk Pipelines. Also, the year-over-year comparison benefited from the absence of losses from Diamond Offshore.
Conversely, losses at Loews Hotels reduced quarterly results, as the pandemic continued to mute travel and thus, hotel demand. Additionally, earnings in the Corporate segment were reduced by some items related to Altium, our packaging subsidiary.
Let me get into more detail about the quarter. CNA contributed net income of $279 million, up dramatically from a $55 million net loss in Q1 2020. The year-over-year turnaround was driven primarily by investment results, both net investment income and net investment gains. But before I discuss investment results, I wanted to highlight CNA's continued solid property casualty underwriting performance.
CNA's core property casualty business posted terrific underwriting results before catastrophe losses. Net earned premium was up almost 6% year-over-year and the combined ratio, excluding CAT losses, was 91.3%, 1.7 points better than last year's first quarter and 1.1 points better than full year 2020. The loss ratio, excluding cats, was 59.5%, an excellent result that was in line with last year's first quarter and with full year 2020.
I would note that prior development was comparable this year and last, with less than 1 point of favorable development in both periods. CNA's expense ratio, which, together with the loss ratio, makes up the combined ratio, declined to 31.5%, which was 1.6 points better than in Q1 2020. The company's expense ratio improvement is notable and results from both expense management and premium growth. As a historical footnote, the company's expense ratio in, say, 2017 was over 34%. So you can see how far CNA has come in a few short years.
Catastrophe losses, however, were elevated during this year's first quarter, thanks largely to winter storms Uri and Viola in Texas. CNA booked 6.8 points of cat losses in Q1, up from 4.3 points in last year's first quarter. As a result, the company's overall combined ratio was up slightly to 98.1% from 97.3% last year. I would highlight that CNA's Q1 cat losses were essentially in line with its market share in the affected areas.
CNA's after-tax net investment income increased $133 million or 48% from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for the entire improvement. The S&P 500 returned 6.2% in this year's first quarter as compared to a negative 19.6% total return in Q1 of last year.
The turnaround in CNA's net investment gains was substantial, swinging from net pretax investment losses of $216 million in Q1 '20 to investment gains of $57 million in Q1 '21. Last year's large losses were mainly attributable to market value declines of nonredeemable preferred stock as well as impairment losses on Corporate bonds. Taken together, the uplift in CNA's net investment income and the turnaround in its net investment gains benefited Loews' year-over-year net income by $306 million. In summary, CNA's investment and non-cat underwriting results were strong during the quarter with CNA and its peers, impacted by an unusually high level of natural catastrophes.
Boardwalk posted an over 8% increase in net revenue and a net income contribution of $85 million, up from $65 million in last year's first quarter.
Turning to Loews Hotels. While the company continues to suffer from the COVID-induced downturn in travel, business is gradually improving, as Jim described. The company posted a net loss of $43 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $25 million in Q1 '20. GAAP operating revenue was $39 million, down from $109 million last year, and the pretax equity loss from joint venture properties was $12 million as opposed to a $4 million loss last year.
In last year's first quarter, business was quite strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter, so precipitously, in fact, that most properties suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. To provide a comparative sense of the hotel company's results, let's look at adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and reconciled in our earnings supplement. It includes all properties and excludes nonrecurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61 million in Q1 of 2019, declined to $17 million in Q1 of 2020, and was a loss of $13 million in this year's first quarter. The low point for profitability was last year's second quarter when Loews Hotels posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA has improved steadily since that low point as business has steadily come back. For a good snapshot of this operational improvement, I would encourage you to review Page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement, which shows the increase in available rooms, occupancy and average daily rate since Q2 last year.
We currently expect, absent any divestitures or development projects, to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million in 2021, down materially from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow. During the first quarter, we invested $32 million in Loews Hotels.
Turning to the Corporate segment. The parent company's investment portfolio generated net pretax income of $46 million as compared to a loss of $166 million last year. Like at CNA, equities and alternatives led the decline last year and the rebound this year. The remainder of the Corporate sector generated a $75 million pretax and $106 million after-tax loss in the quarter. Two main factors, both connected to Altium, drove this larger-than-normal loss.
One, Altium undertook a recapitalization during the quarter, refinancing its existing term loans with a single $1.05 billion term loan. The company booked a $14 million pretax debt extinguishment charge in connection with the recap. And second, the sale of a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, which was pending at quarter end, required Loews to book a $35 million deferred tax liability, which impacted net income, but not pretax income.
Diamond Offshore materially affected our year-over-year earnings comparison, given Diamond's $452 million net loss in last year's first quarter, driven largely by rig impairments. Diamond was consolidated effective April 26, 2020, and had no impact on our results this past quarter. 
A few words about the parent company. As always, we remain determined to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $274 million, and we received about $274 million in dividends from CNA in the quarter, including the $0.38 regular quarterly dividend and the $0.75 special dividend. We also received, as Jim mentioned, a $199 million dividend from Altium, pursuant to its recapitalization.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.6 billion at quarter end, with about 80% in cash and equivalents. After quarter end, we received about $410 million in net proceeds from the sale of 47% of Altium, and have repurchased another 599,000 shares of common stock for about $32 million.
Finally, let me clarify some details relating to the sale of a stake in Altium to GIC. The transaction price implied a total enterprise value of $2 billion for the company and a total equity value of about $900 million. As a reminder, we purchased the company for a total enterprise value of $1.2 billion in 2017 and have not invested any additional capital in Altium since the acquisition.
In the second quarter, upon deconsolidation, we will book a net pretax gain of approximately $560 million, which reflects both the net realized gain on the stake sold to GIC and the unrealized gain on our retained 53% stake. The 53% stake will be held as an equity investment in a nonconsolidated subsidiary at approximately $475 million, reflecting the valuation implied by the price paid by GIC for its 47% stake.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

As soon as they detected the attack, the CNA took steps to address the incident, including, among other things, engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement and also key regulators. CNA has restored the network systems and resumed full normal operations. The company is continuing to assess the full extent of the impact from the incident as well as determining any additional actions that it might take in order to improve its existing systems.

So the impact of February's winter storm in Texas was devastating for the people of Texas, leaving many people without power or heat for the duration of the storm. The Boardwalk team did an incredible job, though, due in large part to many planning hours that were dedicated to the preparation for such an event. And as a result, the company was ready to deliver gas to customers on time during and after the storm.
Through careful operational management and increased staffing in a number of key areas, Boardwalk was able to successfully meet their customers' need for gas despite low inflows into the Boardwalk Pipeline system. As was with the rest of the area, the Boardwalk system faced historically low temperatures and widespread power outages, but was able to continue operating on backup power when necessary. So they really performed admirably during that event."

Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved materially since the onset of the pandemic. Properties have resumed operations, management company and property level expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment.
The low point in Loews Hotels' results was last year's second quarter when GAAP revenue was just $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $54 million. During this year's first quarter, GAAP revenue was $39 million, and the adjusted EBITDA loss had been shrunk to just $13 million.
And as I noted in my remarks, the table on Page 11 of our earnings supplement does show how available rooms, occupancy and average daily rate have all increased quite markedly from last year's second quarter.
Now as a reminder, in terms of cash, during all of last year, the Loews parent company contributed net cash of just over $150 million to Loews Hotels. For 2021, the year we're currently in, we currently expect, absent any divestitures or development projects, to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million. This is down materially, of course, from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow at Loews Hotels. And we've contributed in the first quarter $32 million to the company.
Overall, travel is picking up. Confidence is growing as vaccination rates increase both domestically and internationally. While business travel and group meetings have yet to gain real momentum, leisure travel to resort destinations, in particular, has picked up and is driving Loews Hotels' evolving rebound. And as Jim mentioned, with so many of its rooms located in resort destinations, such as Orlando and Miami Beach, Loews Hotels is well positioned to continue benefiting as we move through the spring into the summer.

So in my opinion, the economy is doing very well, thank you. There's enormous pent-up consumer demand. And with the combination of government stimulus and vaccines, that will add yet more fuel to this fire in the economy, this growth in the economy.
For many in the middle and upper income classes, there was very little to spend on during the lockdowns. There was no travel. There were no restaurants. There was no entertainment other than Netflix. And the savings rates for the past year has been at all-time highs at close to 20%, which is extraordinary, considering that the norm is about 7.5%.
In our hotel business, we're seeing the beginnings of the increase in travel. In some areas, one of the chief constraints to increasing our occupancy rate is staffing. Staffing is also a constraint in our packaging subsidiary, Altium. So what I can foresee are double-digit increases in GDP, driven by consumer demand. But I can also see significant inflation coming from 2 very distinct sources. The first source is cost-push inflation. Especially at the lower end of the pay grade, I see significant increases in wages needed to get people back on to the job. As I said, we're having trouble finding people to work at Altium and, likewise, Loews Hotels and to combat that, there's been serious increases in wages.
The other thing that's adding to the cost-push inflation is that commodities of all sorts are breaking out on the upside. There's copper, there's corn, iron ore, wood, lumber, you name it, commodities are rallying. So businesses are experiencing a lot of increases in their inputs into what they sell.
The second part of the inflation story, in my mind, comes from the demand-pull inflation. I see -- I foresee significant consumer inflation coming from the easing of the pandemic and people making up for a lost year last year of spending. So inflation that was 1.5% to 2%, in my opinion, could be significantly higher in the coming years because of the dramatic increase in demand, combined with the dramatic increase in costs at businesses.
So with this as my base, for the life of me, I don't understand what the Fed and what the Biden administration are doing. Let's start with the Fed. They've got their heads in the sand, in my opinion. The economy is starting to boom, yet we have 0% short-term interest rates, 0%, and inflation is moving up. And they're still managing -- the Fed is still managing both medium- and long-term rates. So that 10-year notes are now under 1.60%. Inflation is significantly over that. And typically, 10-year notes traded at 200 to 300 basis point premium to inflation.
So as a result, no one wants to own term treasury securities. And in fact, the only people who are buying them are people who need to own them, for example, insurance companies that have to have fixed income securities. And the other major, major purchaser of those securities is the Fed itself. My fear is that the Fed is keeping the proverbial punch ball out for the revelers for much too long. In fact, they've said that, that's exactly what they're doing. The Fed said that. And to me, it seems crazy.
With respect to fiscal policy, there are so many trillion-dollar proposals out there that I can't keep them straight. In Washington, D.C., Modern Monetary Theory is the new paradigm. Modern Monetary Theory says that, basically, deficits don't matter. That the government can spend whatever it wants. My view, these politicians and economists are truly kidding themselves. We as a nation are in an extended sugar high that is being elongated by the Fed and the administration's policies, and I'm concerned that at some point down the road, we, as a nation, are going to have to pay a serious price for it.
So just to sum up, as a result of increased consumer demand coming out of the pandemic and also the dramatically increasing government spending, and as I mentioned, the cost-push pressures and also the demand-pull pressures, as a result of all of these factors, I see very strong growth for at least the next several quarters, combined with relatively high inflation, which makes me bearish on intermediate- and long-term interest rates.
So Mary, that's a brief summary of my view of where we are in the economy and where I see it going."

What a difference a year makes? 12 months ago, we were all facing tremendous uncertainty about the future. A year later, while the personal, social, and economic effects of COVID-19 are still impacting each of us individually and collectively, the outlook of Loews has significantly improved. Each of our subsidiaries has been affected differently by the pandemic. But across the board, their responses have been extraordinary, and each business has found its footing in 2021.
First, let's look at our largest subsidiary CNA. The company's operational strength and resilience is evident, not only in its underlying combined ratio and rate increases, but also in its ability to respond nimbly to ongoing challenges. In the first quarter, CNA did experience higher than usual cap losses from what I call the Texas freeze off, but its basic business continued to perform well. CNA's underlying combined ratio of 91.9% improved nearly 2 points over the prior year quarter of 93.7%, with a 1.6 percentage point improvement in the expense ratio. Rate continues to be strong with an 11% increase in the quarter.
CNA's investment portfolio ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in unrealized gains, down from a high of $5.7 billion last quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates. Over the long term, higher interest rates will be beneficial to CNA, allowing it to invest its cash flow at higher rates than today.
Boardwalk Pipelines has substantial operations in Texas, but the February storm had little financial impact on the company. Boardwalk's revenues slightly increased due to higher system utilization during the freeze off, as was the case with other companies in the natural gas transportation industry. The company's solid performance during this crisis was not a lucky accident, rather, it was a result of significant preparation, planning and hard work by the Boardwalk team.
The company's considerable efforts paid off and Boardwalk was able to deliver gas to its customers with minimal disruption. Boardwalk's revenue increase to $370 million in the first quarter of 2021 was due to growth projects that have been placed into service and the colder winter weather.
Of all our subsidiaries, Loews Hotels has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. However, as travel picks up across the country, we are seeing gradual progress at Loews Hotels, especially at the company's resort destinations.
By the end of the first quarter of '21, 23 of the company's 27 hotels were open. And further good news, the company expects to have hotels open in all its markets by the end of the second quarter. Comparing the first quarter of 2021 to the final quarter of 2020, we saw continued improvement in trends. The average daily room rate of our owned and JV hotels that are open increased by 25% to $234.
Leisure travel continues to improve at a faster pace than business travel, and while we expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, occupancy at hotels should increase gradually as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Loews Hotels has an ownership interest in nearly 15,000 rooms, approximately 11,000 of which are located in resort destinations. So we think that Loews Hotels is well positioned to benefit from this leisure-led recovery.
When acquiring a subsidiary, our long-term goal is to have that subsidiary return capital to Loews when the time is appropriate. Loews acquired Altium in 2017 for $1.2 billion, that was $600 million in equity and $600 million in debt at the LTM level. In February of 2021, Altium refinanced its term loans and replaced its roughly $850 million of debt with a new $1.5 billion, 7-year term loan, allowing the company to pay $200 million dividend to Loews. And a month later, on April 1, Loews sold a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, a Singapore Wealth Fund, for gross cash proceeds of $422 million.
With these 2 transactions, Loews has recouped its entire initial investment in Altium, while still retaining a 53% ownership interest in the company. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, we felt the time was right for us to monetize a portion of Loews' ownership stake in Altium. We believe strongly in the long-term prospects of Altium's business, and it's our opinion that the Altium management team is second to none in the industry.  
By retaining a majority ownership position, Loews will be able to capitalize on the future growth trajectory of the company. Additionally, we have gained a strong and like-minded partner in GIC. Under the new ownership structure, Altium has increased its financial flexibility when it comes to larger acquisitions.
Finally, so far in 2021, Loews has purchased more than 6,150,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $49.58 per share for a total of $305 million, representing 2.3% of our outstanding shares. Many a time you've heard me bemoan the discount at which Loews trades. So I'll spare you the rant this time and just let our repurchase activity speak for itself.
David, over to you."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net los",1403,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $261 million or $0.97 per share, a sharp rebound from last year's first quarter net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share. As a reminder, last year's net loss had 2 main drivers. One, investment results at CNA and the Loews parent company, stemming from financial market disruptions as the pandemic spread; and second, risk -- rig impairments at our former consolidated subsidiary, Diamond Offshore.
This year's first quarter benefited from dramatically improved investment results at CNA and the parent company, strong P&C underwriting income at CNA before catastrophe losses and favorable results posted by Boardwalk Pipelines. Also, the year-over-year comparison benefited from the absence of losses from Diamond Offshore.
Conversely, losses at Loews Hotels reduced quarterly results, as the pandemic continued to mute travel and thus, hotel demand. Additionally, earnings in the Corporate segment were reduced by some items related to Altium, our packaging subsidiary.
Let me get into more detail about the quarter. CNA contributed net income of $279 million, up dramatically from a $55 million net loss in Q1 2020. The year-over-year turnaround was driven primarily by investment results, both net investment income and net investment gains. But before I discuss investment results, I wanted to highlight CNA's continued solid property casualty underwriting performance.
CNA's core property casualty business posted terrific underwriting results before catastrophe losses. Net earned premium was up almost 6% year-over-year and the combined ratio, excluding CAT losses, was 91.3%, 1.7 points better than last year's first quarter and 1.1 points better than full year 2020. The loss ratio, excluding cats, was 59.5%, an excellent result that was in line with last year's first quarter and with full year 2020.
I would note that prior development was comparable this year and last, with less than 1 point of favorable development in both periods. CNA's expense ratio, which, together with the loss ratio, makes up the combined ratio, declined to 31.5%, which was 1.6 points better than in Q1 2020. The company's expense ratio improvement is notable and results from both expense management and premium growth. As a historical footnote, the company's expense ratio in, say, 2017 was over 34%. So you can see how far CNA has come in a few short years.
Catastrophe losses, however, were elevated during this year's first quarter, thanks largely to winter storms Uri and Viola in Texas. CNA booked 6.8 points of cat losses in Q1, up from 4.3 points in last year's first quarter. As a result, the company's overall combined ratio was up slightly to 98.1% from 97.3% last year. I would highlight that CNA's Q1 cat losses were essentially in line with its market share in the affected areas.
CNA's after-tax net investment income increased $133 million or 48% from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for the entire improvement. The S&P 500 returned 6.2% in this year's first quarter as compared to a negative 19.6% total return in Q1 of last year.
The turnaround in CNA's net investment gains was substantial, swinging from net pretax investment losses of $216 million in Q1 '20 to investment gains of $57 million in Q1 '21. Last year's large losses were mainly attributable to market value declines of nonredeemable preferred stock as well as impairment losses on Corporate bonds. Taken together, the uplift in CNA's net investment income and the turnaround in its net investment gains benefited Loews' year-over-year net income by $306 million. In summary, CNA's investment and non-cat underwriting results were strong during the quarter with CNA and its peers, impacted by an unusually high level of natural catastrophes.
Boardwalk posted an over 8% increase in net revenue and a net income contribution of $85 million, up from $65 million in last year's first quarter.
Turning to Loews Hotels. While the company continues to suffer from the COVID-induced downturn in travel, business is gradually improving, as Jim described. The company posted a net loss of $43 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $25 million in Q1 '20. GAAP operating revenue was $39 million, down from $109 million last year, and the pretax equity loss from joint venture properties was $12 million as opposed to a $4 million loss last year.
In last year's first quarter, business was quite strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter, so precipitously, in fact, that most properties suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. To provide a comparative sense of the hotel company's results, let's look at adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and reconciled in our earnings supplement. It includes all properties and excludes nonrecurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61 million in Q1 of 2019, declined to $17 million in Q1 of 2020, and was a loss of $13 million in this year's first quarter. The low point for profitability was last year's second quarter when Loews Hotels posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA has improved steadily since that low point as business has steadily come back. For a good snapshot of this operational improvement, I would encourage you to review Page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement, which shows the increase in available rooms, occupancy and average daily rate since Q2 last year.
We currently expect, absent any divestitures or development projects, to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million in 2021, down materially from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow. During the first quarter, we invested $32 million in Loews Hotels.
Turning to the Corporate segment. The parent company's investment portfolio generated net pretax income of $46 million as compared to a loss of $166 million last year. Like at CNA, equities and alternatives led the decline last year and the rebound this year. The remainder of the Corporate sector generated a $75 million pretax and $106 million after-tax loss in the quarter. Two main factors, both connected to Altium, drove this larger-than-normal loss.
One, Altium undertook a recapitalization during the quarter, refinancing its existing term loans with a single $1.05 billion term loan. The company booked a $14 million pretax debt extinguishment charge in connection with the recap. And second, the sale of a 47% stake in Altium to GIC, which was pending at quarter end, required Loews to book a $35 million deferred tax liability, which impacted net income, but not pretax income.
Diamond Offshore materially affected our year-over-year earnings comparison, given Diamond's $452 million net loss in last year's first quarter, driven largely by rig impairments. Diamond was consolidated effective April 26, 2020, and had no impact on our results this past quarter. 
A few words about the parent company. As always, we remain determined to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $274 million, and we received about $274 million in dividends from CNA in the quarter, including the $0.38 regular quarterly dividend and the $0.75 special dividend. We also received, as Jim mentioned, a $199 million dividend from Altium, pursuant to its recapitalization.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.6 billion at quarter end, with about 80% in cash and equivalents. After quarter end, we received about $410 million in net proceeds from the sale of 47% of Altium, and have repurchased another 599,000 shares of common stock for about $32 million.
Finally, let me clarify some details relating to the sale of a stake in Altium to GIC. The transaction price implied a total enterprise value of $2 billion for the company and a total equity value of about $900 million. As a reminder, we purchased the company for a total enterprise value of $1.2 billion in 2017 and have not invested any additional capital in Altium since the acquisition.
In the second quarter, upon deconsolidation, we will book a net pretax gain of approximately $560 million, which reflects both the net realized gain on the stake sold to GIC and the unrealized gain on our retained 53% stake. The 53% stake will be held as an equity investment in a nonconsolidated subsidiary at approximately $475 million, reflecting the valuation implied by the price paid by GIC for its 47% stake.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

As soon as they detected the attack, the CNA took steps to address the incident, including, among other things, engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement and also key regulators. CNA has restored the network systems and resumed full normal operations. The company is continuing to assess the full extent of the impact from the incident as well as determining any additional actions that it might take in order to improve its existing systems.

So the impact of February's winter storm in Texas was devastating for the people of Texas, leaving many people without power or heat for the duration of the storm. The Boardwalk team did an incredible job, though, due in large part to many planning hours that were dedicated to the preparation for such an event. And as a result, the company was ready to deliver gas to customers on time during and after the storm.
Through careful operational management and increased staffing in a number of key areas, Boardwalk was able to successfully meet their customers' need for gas despite low inflows into the Boardwalk Pipeline system. As was with the rest of the area, the Boardwalk system faced historically low temperatures and widespread power outages, but was able to continue operating on backup power when necessary. So they really performed admirably during that event."

Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved materially since the onset of the pandemic. Properties have resumed operations, management company and property level expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment.
The low point in Loews Hotels' results was last year's second quarter when GAAP revenue was just $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $54 million. During this year's first quarter, GAAP revenue was $39 million, and the adjusted EBITDA loss had been shrunk to just $13 million.
And as I noted in my remarks, the table on Page 11 of our earnings supplement does show how available rooms, occupancy and average daily rate have all increased quite markedly from last year's second quarter.
Now as a reminder, in terms of cash, during all of last year, the Loews parent company contributed net cash of just over $150 million to Loews Hotels. For 2021, the year we're currently in, we currently expect, absent any divestitures or development projects, to make a net cash contribution to Loews Hotels of less than $80 million. This is down materially, of course, from our earlier estimates given better-than-anticipated cash flow at Loews Hotels. And we've contributed in the first quarter $32 million to the company.
Overall, travel is picking up. Confidence is growing as vaccination rates increase both domestically and internationally. While business travel and group meetings have yet to gain real momentum, leisure travel to resort destinations, in particular, has picked up and is driving Loews Hotels' evolving rebound. And as Jim mentioned, with so many of its rooms located in resort destinations, such as Orlando and Miami Beach, Loews Hotels is well positioned to continue benefiting as we move through the spring into the summer.

So in my opinion, the economy is doing very well, thank you. There's enormous pent-up consumer demand. And with the combination of government stimulus and vaccines, that will add yet more fuel to this fire in the economy, this growth in the economy.
For many in the middle and upper income classes, there was very little to spend on during the lockdowns. There was no travel. There were no restaurants. There was no entertainment other than Netflix. And the savings rates for the past year has been at all-time highs at close to 20%, which is extraordinary, considering that the norm is about 7.5%.
In our hotel business, we're seeing the beginnings of the increase in travel. In some areas, one of the chief constraints to increasing our occupancy rate is staffing. Staffing is also a constraint in our packaging subsidiary, Altium. So what I can foresee are double-digit increases in GDP, driven by consumer demand. But I can also see significant inflation coming from 2 very distinct sources. The first source is cost-push inflation. Especially at the lower end of the pay grade, I see significant increases in wages needed to get people back on to the job. As I said, we're having trouble finding people to work at Altium and, likewise, Loews Hotels and to combat that, there's been serious increases in wages.
The other thing that's adding to the cost-push inflation is that commodities of all sorts are breaking out on the upside. There's copper, there's corn, iron ore, wood, lumber, you name it, commodities are rallying. So businesses are experiencing a lot of increases in their inputs into what they sell.
The second part of the inflation story, in my mind, comes from the demand-pull inflation. I see -- I foresee significant consumer inflation coming from the easing of the pandemic and people making up for a lost year last year of spending. So inflation that was 1.5% to 2%, in my opinion, could be significantly higher in the coming years because of the dramatic increase in demand, combined with the dramatic increase in costs at businesses.
So with this as my base, for the life of me, I don't understand what the Fed and what the Biden administration are doing. Let's start with the Fed. They've got their heads in the sand, in my opinion. The economy is starting to boom, yet we have 0% short-term interest rates, 0%, and inflation is moving up. And they're still managing -- the Fed is still managing both medium- and long-term rates. So that 10-year notes are now under 1.60%. Inflation is significantly over that. And typically, 10-year notes traded at 200 to 300 basis point premium to inflation.
So as a result, no one wants to own term treasury securities. And in fact, the only people who are buying them are people who need to own them, for example, insurance companies that have to have fixed income securities. And the other major, major purchaser of those securities is the Fed itself. My fear is that the Fed is keeping the proverbial punch ball out for the revelers for much too long. In fact, they've said that, that's exactly what they're doing. The Fed said that. And to me, it seems crazy.
With respect to fiscal policy, there are so many trillion-dollar proposals out there that I can't keep them straight. In Washington, D.C., Modern Monetary Theory is the new paradigm. Modern Monetary Theory says that, basically, deficits don't matter. That the government can spend whatever it wants. My view, these politicians and economists are truly kidding themselves. We as a nation are in an extended sugar high that is being elongated by the Fed and the administration's policies, and I'm concerned that at some point down the road, we, as a nation, are going to have to pay a serious price for it.
So just to sum up, as a result of increased consumer demand coming out of the pandemic and also the dramatically increasing government spending, and as I mentioned, the cost-push pressures and also the demand-pull pressures, as a result of all of these factors, I see very strong growth for at least the next several quarters, combined with relatively high inflation, which makes me bearish on intermediate- and long-term interest rates.
So Mary, that's a brief summary of my view of where we are in the economy and where I see it going."

Those hotels, while still recovering from the effects of the pandemic has bounced back smartly especially in the resort markets, and we're starting to see some pickup from group business well. I'm going to focus my remarks today on CNA and Loews Hotels. 
As for CNA, the company continues to be a success story for Loews. CNA had net income of almost $370 million in the second quarter of this year, the second highest quarterly net income recorded by the company in the past 20 years. And more importantly, record high core income for the quarter. The company's underlying combined ratio decreased by almost 2 points over the prior year's quarter, driven by improvement in the expense ratio. 
CNA's P&C business generated gross written premium growth of 8%, driven by new business growth of 10% and rate increases of 10% for the quarter. CNA had net investment income of $591 million pretax compared to $534 million in the prior year's quarter. Limited partnerships had a great quarter and the fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent earnings even with headwinds from the lower interest rate environment. In other words, CNA's results were truly strong. 
Loews Hotels also had a success story on its hand within the context of its comeback from global pandemic that devastated the hospitality industry. It's no secret that our hotel company was the subsidiary most affected by COVID-19. That being said, over the last few months, Loews Hotels has continued to see increased demand for leisure travel and is starting to see improving interest for group travel. For the second quarter, total occupancy rates for owned and joint venture hotels were almost 58% as opposed to about 35% during the first quarter of this year. While that is a big jump, obviously, we still have a ways to go before we hit pre-pandemic occupancy rates. Our resort hotels continue to do considerably better than our properties in urban settings. All in all, the good news is that by the end of the second quarter, each and every one of our hotels was open for business, albeit while facing challenges filling roles at the property level. 
As the U.S. economy and the hotel industry continue their recovery, we firmly believe that Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews Corp. Our confidence in the hotel company is a reflection of our belief not only in its management, but also in its long-term growth strategy. As a reminder, that growth strategy is built on 2 pillars. The first pillar is the core business of Loews Hotels, Hotels with 300-plus keys that have ample meeting space. This first pillar takes advantage of Loews' well-earned reputation for operating hotels that cater to groups. These properties are equally attractive to leisure customers and offer unique local experiences. The second pillar of Hotels' growth strategy is its concentration on developing and operating hotels associated with immersive destinations. Its partnership with Universal Orlando, which spans more than 2 decades, is a great example of the strength of this pillar. As of the end of the second quarter, Loews Hotels had 9,000 rooms in 8 hotels on the Universal Orlando Resort campus, and all of the properties were open and performing well. 
Loews Hotels has concentrated on adding more immersive destinations where demand for hotel rooms is strong because of the presence of a built-in demand generator, such as an adjacent sports stadium or some other attraction. One such hotel that proved to be quite resilient during the pandemic is the live by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which is located a stone's throw away from 2 professional sports stadiums as well as entertainment venues that draw customers throughout the year. 
Another significant differentiator for Loews Hotels is its ability to be both the owner and the operator of its properties. And when I say owner, I generally mean owner and development partner. It's great when we can participate in the design phase in order to build a hotel to our exacting standards. Industry dynamics generally do not allow for companies in the hotel space to perform both the owner and the operator functions. And as a result, Loews Hotels is a leader within this niche of the market, playing to these strains to serve Loews Hotels well, and we believe it will continue to do so. 
Currently, there is very little financing available for most hotel developers in the full-service hotel space. As a result, being a well-capitalized owner operator gives Loews Hotels a distinct advantage when competing for attractive development projects. As always, Loews Corporation invests alongside our subsidiaries when it's in the best interest of our shareholders. And we certainly believe that our investment in Loews Hotels' growth strategy will create long-term value. 
Finally, let me update you briefly on share repurchases. From April 1 through last Friday, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of Loews' common stock for just over $350 million. Year-to-date, we've bought back 4.5% of our outstanding shares for $630 million. As I've often said, we believe that Loews still trades at a significant discount to our view of its intrinsic value. So we'll continue to let our share repurchase activity speak for itself. 
And with that, let me hand the call over to David."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $754 million or $2.86 per share compared to a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share in last year's second quarter. As Jim commented, our second quarter",1097,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $754 million or $2.86 per share compared to a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share in last year's second quarter. As Jim commented, our second quarter operating results were excellent, driven by CNA and Boardwalk, both of which had stellar quarters. While Loews Hotels did post a loss, its business has rebounded more strongly than expected, especially at its highly desirable resort properties. 
Our second quarter results, both this year and last year were impacted by unusual items. Absent these unusual items, which I will describe in a moment, our Q2 net income rebounded to $316 million this year from $122 million last year. This year's second quarter included a net investment gain of $555 million before tax and $438 million after tax on our sale of a 47% stake in Altium Packaging. The investment gain is essentially the sum of the realized gain on the shares sold and the unrealized appreciation on our retained 53% stake. 
Last year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the bankruptcy and concurrent GAAP deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore. This loss totaled $1.2 billion before tax and $957 million after tax. Setting aside these 2 unusual items, all 3 of our consolidated subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Loews Hotels recorded materially higher year-over-year net income contributions with CNA leading the charge. CNA had its earnings call earlier this morning, and I would encourage you to review the transcript for more details on the quarter. In the meantime, let me highlight a few salient points. 
CNA contributed net income of $330 million, up from $135 million in Q2 '20. The 2 main drivers of the year-over-year increase were higher property casualty underwriting income generated by lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting income as well as higher net investment income. The combination of an 11% year-over-year increase in net earned premium and an almost 2-point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to 91.4 and led to a 41% increase in CNA's underlying underwriting gain, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year development. 
Catastrophe losses were modest in the quarter at $54 million pretax in contrast to the elevated level of catastrophe losses booked in Q2 2020. Last year's second quarter catastrophe losses were $301 million pretax and included reserves for COVID, civil unrest and weather-related events. 
CNA's all-in combined ratio, which includes catastrophe losses and prior year development, improved by over 15 points from 109.2 in Q2 2020 to 94 this year. The year-over-year increase in CNA's net investment income was driven mainly by higher returns on its portfolio of limited partnership investments. In contrast, net investment gains were lower in Q2 2021 than in the prior year quarter. 
A quick comment on CNA's second quarter net written premium. While net earned premium across all property casualty segments rose 11%, CNA's net written premium declined 1% overall and 12% in commercial. The year-over-year decline in written premium was attributable to a quota share treaty CNA added to its property reinsurance program during the second quarter. Because the treaty will cover property policies already in force as well as policies written during the treaty term, CNA recorded a onetime written premium catch-up that reduced the quarter's net written premium by $122 million, predominantly in the Commercial segment. CNA ended the quarter with total assets of $66 billion, shareholders' equity of $12.7 billion and consolidated statutory surplus of approximately $10.9 billion. 
Turning to Boardwalk. Boardwalk contributed net income of $47 million, up from $34 million in Q2 '20. The main driver of the year-over-year increase was higher natural gas transportation revenue. Boardwalk's more than 5% increase in net operating revenue was driven by growth projects recently placed in service and by higher system utilization caused largely by deliveries to LNG markets and power plants. Through 6 months, natural gas transportation throughput increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Turning to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels contributed a net loss of $21 million, a dramatic improvement from the $72 million net loss posted in Q2 2020. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, rebounded from a $54 million loss last year to a positive $26 million in Q2 '21. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a dramatic revenue increase as most properties were open for the full quarter and all properties were operational by quarter end. Business at resort properties benefited especially from increased leisure travel. Looking backwards, the second quarter of 2020 was exceedingly difficult for Loews Hotels as almost all its properties suspended operations for most of the quarter. 
GAAP net operating revenue plummeted 94% from the second quarter of 2019 and revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP net operating revenue declined a similar percentage.
For a good snapshot of Loews' steady operational improvement, I would encourage you to review, I believe it's Page 11

as part of the corporate segment since we acquired the company in 2017. Following our sale of a 47% stake, it remains in the Corporate segment, but is now accounted for under the equity method. The Corporate segment also includes the unusual items I mentioned earlier, namely a net investment gain this year related to our sale of a 47% stake in Altium and a net investment loss last year stemming from the bankruptcy and deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore. I would note that this year's second quarter results also reflect a $15 million pretax write-off of our equity investment in Diamond upon its emergence from bankruptcy. 
The parent company's investment portfolio generated pretax net investment income of $24 million as compared to $110 million last year. Last year's results benefited from the significant recovery of the equity markets in the second quarter, a quarter in which the S&P 500 returned almost 21%. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.9 billion at quarter end with about 80% in cash and equivalents. 
As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock for $219 million, and we received about $92 million in dividends from CNA. In addition, we received about $410 million in net proceeds from the Altium transaction during the second quarter. After quarter end, we repurchased another 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. As of last Friday, there were approximately 257 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding down more than 8% from June 30, 2020. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

While interest rates are low, the P&C industry continues to have disciplined capital management. Overall, P&C pricing continues to be healthy. CNA is attracting high-quality new business and its improving underwriting margins through focused risk and pricing. And let's not forget CNA's management team is top-notch, and the company continues to attract high-quality professionals. 
The company also has a fortress balance sheet, even after paying almost $5 billion in dividends to its shareholders over the past 5 years. Additionally, CNA's long-term care exposure continues to decrease with active policies declining by about 1/3 over the past 5 years. Given CNA's strong performance and future outlook, we believe the company is greatly undervalued. And speaking of undervalued, when buying Loews' shares, we are always cognizant of what we call the triple discount. Let me briefly explain what I mean. 
First, Loews shares trade below our view of their intrinsic value; secondly, the P&C industry tends to be undervalued compared to the stock market; and third, CNA trades at a discount to the P&C industry. Some growth companies trade at 15x revenue, some value companies trade at 12 to 15x EBITDA, that's EBITDA and not net income. The S&P 500 trades at 20 -- greater than 20x earnings, but some P&C companies trade at immediately 11 to 12x net income, actual net income which could be distributed directly to shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on this fact, the undervaluation of the P&C industry seems crazy to me. And CNA's undervaluation even more so, WTF."

During our first quarter earnings call, we stated that before considering proceeds from divestitures or expenditures on new development projects, we expect it to contribute less than $80 million of cash to Loews Hotels in 2021. This revised estimate was materially lower than our earlier estimates, given the better-than-anticipated outlook for Loews Hotels' operating cash flow at the end of the first quarter. At that time, we had contributed $32 million to Loews Hotels year-to-date. We have made no further cash contributions since that time to Loews Hotels. 
Loews Hotels' outlook continued to improve during the second quarter. We now anticipate that again, before considering any proceeds from divestitures or expenditures on new development projects during the second half of the year, Loews Hotels would not require additional cash from the parent company in 2021. I would highlight, however, that if Loews Hotels does close on one or more significant development opportunities in the back half of this year, we would likely be required to contribute additional cash to the company in 2021 and for all the right reasons.

Based on current market dynamics, however, acquiring a new hotel doesn't make economic sense. Not when you compare the long-term favorable returns, Loews Hotels received by developing its own hotels. Many markets in the U.S. have older full-service hotels. By building a new hotel with modern spaces or significantly renovating an existing location, we immediately gain a competitive advantage by offering an attractive new product that appeals to both leisure guests and to meeting planners. 
Over the last 5 years, Loews Hotels has added valuable new properties to its portfolio by building-to-suit our own exacting standards as opposed to buying already developed hotels. By building-to-suit, we develop hotels that focus on one or both of our growth strategy pillars, hotels with more than 300 keys that cater to groups and hotels that operate near built-in demand generators. The first pillar of Loews Hotels' growth strategy is its well-earned reputation for excellence in the groups and meetings market in locations attractive to groups as well as to leisure customers. Guests are also attracted by the unique local experience these properties offer. 
The second pillar of growth is those hotels is focused on immersive destinations, such as Universal Studios, Orlando campus, where Loews Hotels has 8 hotels with 9,000 rooms. Loews Hotels has pursued additional immersive destinations where demand for hotel rooms is strong because of the presence of a built-in demand generator, such as an adjacent sports stadiums or other attractions. Live by Loews in Arlington, Texas is one such hotel that has proven to be very resilient during the pandemic. The Arlington hotel is located near numerous professional sports and entertainment venues. 
From 2015 to 2019, Loews Hotels grew adjusted EBITDA from just under [ $160 ] million to almost $230 million with healthy margins. 2020 was clearly a very challenging year for our hosiery and for the industry. In 2021, Loews Hotels has certainly gained ground. And while we continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, we believe that over the long term, hotel company will once again be a profitable growth engine for Loews Corp."

Let's start with inflatio",979,"So the nice thing about getting questions before the earnings call is that I can prepare a thoughtful response rather than just wing it, such as the case with the answer to your question, Mary, about interest rates and inflation. Let's start with inflation. On the last earnings call, I talked about cost push and demand pull inflation. And I said that we are seeing both forms of inflation these days. Today, I want to speak about what used to be called the cycle of inflation. That was a common term in the '60s through the early '80s when inflation was much, much higher than it is today. As you can imagine, the cycle of inflation relates to a dynamic that takes hold in an economy that relates to increasing prices and the expectation of ever increasing prices, making it such that employees demand higher wages to maintain their purchasing power and their standard of living. Those higher wages then translate into higher cost for producers which causes the producers to ask for higher prices for their products, thus reinforcing the demand for higher wages from labor, and so the cycle begins and feeds upon itself. I believe that this cycle of inflation is what we are beginning to experience today. 
Talent is scarce. Just look at the number of companies that can't find employees for their businesses, including Loews for its Hotel and Packaging businesses. Certain goods are also scarce. Here are just a few whose prices have shot up a lot. Computer chips, coffee, polyethylene pellets, and aluminum, soybeans, oil, natural gas and yes, jet fuel. The CRB raw Industrials Index is up by more than 50% from a year ago. Dishwashers, washing machine, dryers and refrigerators are all on month's long back orders. Housing prices are up approximately 25%, 25% in the past year. And of course, there's a shortage of labor in the labor market, a very, very serious shortage. And esteemed a common friend of mine said that, this year is the 11th time that the core CPI has risen more than 3% in the first 6 months of the year. On 9 of those 10 previous occasions, core CPI inflation for the full year was at least 6%. So by that measure, we're on track for inflation of much more than 6%. Because for the first 6 months of this year, inflation is already at 5.4%. And so it's an easy bet that inflation for all of 2021 will greatly surpass 6%. 
I believe that our current labor shortage is not a temporary phenomenon, and it will only be resolved with significantly higher levels of compensation, causing cost to increase, leading to ever higher inflation. I believe that we are now in a cycle of inflation rather than a spurt within an otherwise benign inflationary period. This year, we are moving from an extended year -- of less than 2% inflation to a year of more than 6% or 7% inflation. And due to increased labor costs, my expectation for inflation in '22 is for significantly higher inflation than the 2% level we have seen in the recent past. This inflation problem won't go away by simply wishing it away, especially with the Fed's proverbial foot still on the gas pedal, which, of course, brings us to interest rates. 
The economist, Rudi Dornbusch famously said in the '60s that in economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you ever thought that they could. Such as the case, I believe, with interest rates in the United States. They're too damn low. And the reason that they're so low is because in the past 1.5 years, the Fed has purchased over $4 trillion of government securities. That's $4 trillion of government securities that have been taken out of the market. Poof, they're gone. The Fed has created a squeeze of gargantuan proportions in these securities that has rippled through all the fixed income markets. The only people that own U.S. fixed income securities are people who need to own them, like banks and insurance companies, just to name a few. 
Traders may dabble in government securities, but investors won't go near them, because there isn't a bullish case to be made for investing in government securities. Today, the 10-year note yields less than 1.2%. If the rate on those nodes goes up just 13 basis points, a little over [ a tenth of 1% ], then the entire interest carry on the bond for the year will disappear. That sounds like a miserable investment to me. 
Getting back to inflation. If the inflation rate this year is 6%, and that's a low number, I believe, then the negative real return on a 10-year note will be minus 4.75%. That's minus 4.75%. Who would want to own a security that guarantees you'll lose almost 5% of your purchasing power in a single year. Most people have already decided to either hold cash or move out the risk curve rather than lock in a real loss of such large proportions. The issuance of government securities will continue. For this year, the federal deficit is forecast to be $3 trillion, which means there is no end to the supply of government bonds that need to be issued to finance our government activities. And with so much issuance of government securities on the way and with a strong economy and with inflation running so hot and with the negative real yield so unattractive, the Fed may have little choice but to take their foot off the proverbial gas panel and take away the punch bowl finally allowing interest rates to rise. There's only so long that the Fed can delay the inevitable and to me and maybe to Rudi Dornbusch of memory, that time may soon be upon us."

Loews had a strong quarter across the board with good performances from each of our consolidated subsidiaries. CNA led the pack with great results, and Boardwalk continues to benefit from strong natural gas flows. Loews Hotels, while still recovering from the effects of the pandemic has bounced back smartly especially in the resort markets, and we're starting to see some pickup from group business well. I'm going to focus my remarks today on CNA and Loews Hotels.  
As for CNA, the company continues to be a success story for Loews. CNA had net income of almost $370 million in the second quarter of this year, the second highest quarterly net income recorded by the company in the past 20 years. And more importantly, record high core income for the quarter. The company's underlying combined ratio decreased by almost 2 points over the prior year's quarter, driven by improvement in the expense ratio.  
CNA's P&C business generated gross written premium growth of 8%, driven by new business growth of 10% and rate increases of 10% for the quarter. CNA had net investment income of $591 million pretax compared to $534 million in the prior year's quarter. Limited partnerships had a great quarter and the fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent earnings even with headwinds from the lower interest rate environment. In other words, CNA's results were truly strong. 
Loews Hotels also had a success story on its hand within the context of its comeback from global pandemic that devastated the hospitality industry. It's no secret that our hotel company was the subsidiary most affected by COVID-19. That being said, over the last few months, Loews Hotels has continued to see increased demand for leisure travel and is starting to see improving interest for group travel. 
For the second quarter, total occupancy rates for owned and joint venture hotels were almost 58% as opposed to about 35% during the first quarter of this year. While that is a big jump, obviously, we still have a ways to go before we hit pre-pandemic occupancy rates. Our resort hotels continue to do considerably better than our properties in urban settings. All in all, the good news is that by the end of the second quarter, each and every one of our hotels was open for business, albeit while facing challenges filling roles at the property level.  
As the U.S. economy and the hotel industry continue their recovery, we firmly believe that Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews Corp. Our confidence in the hotel company is a reflection of our belief not only in its management, but also in its long-term growth strategy. 
As a reminder, that growth strategy is built on 2 pillars. The first pillar is the core business of Loews Hotels, Hotels with 300-plus keys that have ample meeting space. This first pillar takes advantage of Loews' well-earned reputation for operating hotels that cater to groups. These properties are equally attractive to leisure customers and offer unique local experiences. 
The second pillar of Hotels' growth strategy is its concentration on developing and operating hotels associated with immersive destinations. Its partnership with Universal Orlando, which spans more than 2 decades, is a great example of the strength of this pillar. As of the end of the second quarter, Loews Hotels had 9,000 rooms in 8 hotels on the Universal Orlando Resort campus, and all of the properties were open and performing well.  
Loews Hotels has concentrated on adding more immersive destinations where demand for hotel rooms is strong because of the presence of a built-in demand generator, such as an adjacent sports stadium or some other attraction. One such hotel that proved to be quite resilient during the pandemic is the Live! by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which is located a stone's throw away from 2 professional sports stadiums as well as entertainment venues that draw customers throughout the year.  
Another significant differentiator for Loews Hotels is its ability to be both the owner and the operator of its properties. And when I say owner, I generally mean owner and development partner. It's great when we can participate in the design phase in order to build a hotel to our exacting standards. 
Industry dynamics generally do not allow for companies in the hotel space to perform both the owner and the operator functions. And as a result, Loews Hotels is a leader within this niche of the market, playing to these strengths to serve Loews Hotels well, and we believe it will continue to do so.  
Currently, there is very little financing available for most hotel developers in the full-service hotel space. As a result, being a well-capitalized owner operator gives Loews Hotels a distinct advantage when competing for attractive development projects. As always, Loews Corporation invests alongside our subsidiaries when it's in the best interest of our shareholders. And we certainly believe that our investment in Loews Hotels' growth strategy will create long-term value.  
Finally, let me update you briefly on share repurchases. From April 1 through last Friday, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of Loews' common stock for just over $350 million. Year-to-date, we've bought back 4.5% of our outstanding shares for $630 million. As I've often said, we believe that Loews still trades at a significant discount to our view of its intrinsic value. So we'll continue to let our share repurchase activity speak for itself.  
And with that, let me hand the call over to David."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $754 million or $2.86 per share compared to a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share in last year's second quarter. As Jim commented, our second quarter",1167,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $754 million or $2.86 per share compared to a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share in last year's second quarter. As Jim commented, our second quarter operating results were excellent, driven by CNA and Boardwalk, both of which had stellar quarters. 
While Loews Hotels did post a loss, its business has rebounded more strongly than expected, especially at its highly desirable resort properties. Our second quarter results, both this year and last year were impacted by unusual items. Absent these unusual items, which I will describe in a moment, our Q2 net income rebounded to $316 million this year from $122 million last year. 
This year's second quarter included a net investment gain of $555 million before tax and $438 million after tax on our sale of a 47% stake in Altium Packaging. The investment gain is essentially the sum of the realized gain on the shares sold and the unrealized appreciation on our retained 53% stake.  
Last year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the bankruptcy and concurrent GAAP de-consolidation of Diamond Offshore. This loss totaled $1.2 billion before tax and $957 million after tax. Setting aside these 2 unusual items, all 3 of our consolidated subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Loews Hotels recorded materially high or year-over-year net income contributions with CNA leading the charge. 
CNA had its earnings call earlier this morning, and I would encourage you to review the transcript for more details on the quarter. In the meantime, let me highlight a few salient points. CNA contributed net income of $330 million, up from $135 million in Q2 '20. The 2 main drivers of the year-over-year increase were higher property casualty underwriting income generated by lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting income as well as higher net investment income. 
The combination of an 11% year-over-year increase in net earned premium and an almost 2-point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to 91.4 and led to a 41% increase in CNA's underlying underwriting gain, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year development. 
Catastrophe losses were modest in the quarter at $54 million pretax in contrast to the elevated level of catastrophe losses booked in Q2 2020. Last year's second quarter catastrophe losses were $301 million pretax and included reserves for COVID, civil unrest and weather-related events. 
CNA's all-in combined ratio, which includes catastrophe losses and prior year development, improved by over 15 points from 109.2 in Q2 2020 to 94 this year. The year-over-year increase in CNA's net investment income was driven mainly by higher returns on its portfolio of limited partnership investments. In contrast, net investment gains were lower in Q2 2021 than in the prior year quarter. 
A quick comment on CNA's second quarter net written premium. While net earned premium across all property casualty segments rose 11%, CNA's net written premium declined 1% overall and 12% in commercial. The year-over-year decline in written premium was attributable to a quota share treaty CNA added to its property reinsurance program during the second quarter. Because the treaty will cover property policies already in force as well as policies written during the treaty term, CNA recorded a onetime written premium catch-up that reduced the quarter's net written premium by $122 million, predominantly in the Commercial segment. 
CNA ended the quarter with total assets of $66 billion, shareholders' equity of $12.7 billion and consolidated statutory surplus of approximately $10.9 billion. 
Turning to Boardwalk. Boardwalk contributed net income of $47 million, up from $34 million in Q2 '20. The main driver of the year-over-year increase was higher natural gas transportation revenue. Boardwalk's more than 5% increase in net operating revenue was driven by growth projects recently placed in service and by higher system utilization caused largely by deliveries to LNG markets and power plants. Through 6 months, natural gas transportation throughput increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Turning to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels contributed a net loss of $21 million, a dramatic improvement from the $72 million net loss posted in Q2 2020. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, rebounded from a $54 million loss last year to a positive $26 million in Q2 '21. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a dramatic revenue increase as most properties were open for the full quarter and all properties were operational by quarter end. Business at resort properties benefited especially from increased leisure travel. 
Looking backwards, the second quarter of 2020 was exceedingly difficult for Loews Hotels as almost all its properties suspended operations for most of the quarter. GAAP net operating revenue plummeted 94% from the second quarter of 2019 and revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP net operating revenue declined a similar percentage.
For a good snapshot of Loews' steady operational improvement, I would encourage you to review, I believe it's Page 11, of our quarterly earnings supplement which shows the meaningful increases since Q2 last year in available rooms, occupancy and average daily rate. 
A quick comment regarding Diamond Offshore. We included Diamond Offshore as a reporting segment until its bankruptcy filing and de-consolidation in late April 2020. Our second quarter 2020 results included a net operating loss of $24 million attributable to Diamond. 
Turning to the Corporate segment. Altium has been reported as part of the Corporate segment since we acquired the company in 2017. Following our sale of a 47% stake, it remains in the Corporate segment, but is now accounted for under the equity method. The Corporate segment also includes the unusual items I mentioned earlier, namely a net investment gain this year related to our sale of a 47% stake in Altium and a net investment loss last year stemming from the bankruptcy and de-consolidation of Diamond Offshore. 
I would note that this year's second quarter results also reflect a $15 million pretax write-off of our equity investment in Diamond upon its emergence from bankruptcy. 
The parent company's investment portfolio generated pretax net investment income of $24 million as compared to $110 million last year. Last year's results benefited from the significant recovery of the equity markets in the second quarter, a quarter in which the S&P 500 returned almost 21%. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.9 billion at quarter end with about 80% in cash and equivalents. 
As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock for $219 million, and we received about $92 million in dividends from CNA. In addition, we received about $410 million in net proceeds from the Altium transaction during the second quarter. After quarter end, we repurchased another 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. As of last Friday, there were approximately 257 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding down more than 8% from June 30, 2020. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

While interest rates are low, the P&C industry continues to have disciplined capital management. Overall, P&C pricing continues to be healthy. CNA is attracting high-quality new business and its improving underwriting margins through focused risk [ relation ] and pricing. And let's not forget CNA's management team is top-notch, and the company continues to attract high-quality professionals. 
The company also has a fortress balance sheet, even after paying almost $5 billion in dividends to its shareholders over the past 5 years. Additionally, CNA's long-term care exposure continues to decrease with active policies declining by about 1/3 over the past 5 years. Given CNA's strong performance and future outlook, we believe the company is greatly undervalued. 
And speaking of undervalued, when buying Loews' shares, we are always cognizant of what we call the triple discount. Let me briefly explain what I mean. First, Loews shares trade below our view of their intrinsic value; secondly, the P&C industry tends to be undervalued compared to the stock market; and third, CNA trades at a discount to the P&C industry. 
Some growth companies trade at 15x revenue, some value companies trade at 12 to 15x EBITDA, that's EBITDA and not net income. The S&P 500 trades at 20 -- greater than 20x earnings, but some P&C companies trade at a measly 11 to 12x net income, actual net income which could be distributed directly to shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on this fact, the undervaluation of the P&C industry seems crazy to me. And CNA's undervaluation even more so, WTF."

During our first quarter earnings call, we stated that before considering proceeds from divestitures or expenditures on new development projects, we expect it to contribute less than $80 million of cash to Loews Hotels in 2021. This revised estimate was materially lower than our earlier estimates, given the better-than-anticipated outlook for Loews Hotels' operating cash flow at the end of the first quarter. 
At that time, we had contributed $32 million to Loews Hotels year-to-date. We have made no further cash contributions since that time to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels' outlook continued to improve during the second quarter. We now anticipate that, again, before considering any proceeds from divestitures or expenditures on new development projects during the second half of the year, Loews Hotels would not require additional cash from the parent company in 2021. 
I would highlight, however, that if Loews Hotels does close on one or more significant development opportunities in the back half of this year, we would likely be required to contribute additional cash to the company in 2021 and for all the right reasons. Thanks, Mary."

Based on current market dynamics, however, acquiring a new hotel doesn't make economic sense. Not when you compare the long-term favorable returns, Loews Hotels received by developing its own hotels. Many markets in the U.S. have older full-service hotels. By building a new hotel with modern spaces or significantly renovating an existing location, we immediately gain a competitive advantage by offering an attractive new product that appeals to both leisure guests and to meeting planners. 
Over the last 5 years, Loews Hotels has added valuable new properties to its portfolio by building-to-suit our own exacting standards as opposed to buying already developed hotels. By building-to-suit, we develop hotels that focus on one or both of our growth strategy pillars, hotels with more than 300 keys that cater to groups and hotels that operate near built-in demand generators. The first pillar of Loews Hotels' growth strategy is its well-earned reputation for excellence in the groups and meetings market in locations attractive to groups as well as to leisure customers. Guests are also attracted by the unique local experience these properties offer. 
The second pillar of growth is Loews Hotels' focused on immersive destinations, such as Universal Studios, Orlando Campus, where Loews Hotels has 8 hotels with 9,000 rooms. Loews Hotels has pursued additional immersive destinations where demand for hotel rooms is strong because of the presence of a built-in demand generator, such as an adjacent sports stadiums or other attractions. Live! by Loews in Arlington, Texas is one such hotel that has proven to be very resilient during the pandemic. The Arlington hotel is located near numerous professional sports and entertainment venues. 
From 2015 to 2019, Loews Hotels grew adjusted EBITDA from just under $160 million to almost $230 million with healthy margins. 2020 was clearly a very challenging year for our hotel subsidiary and for the industry. In 2021, Loews Hotels has certainly gained ground. And while we continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, we believe that over the long term, the hotel company will once again be a profitable growth engine for Loews Corp."

Let's start with inflat",979,"So the nice thing about getting questions before the earnings call is that I can prepare a thoughtful response rather than just wing it, such as the case with the answer to your question, Mary, about interest rates and inflation. 
Let's start with inflation. On the last earnings call, I talked about a cost push and demand pull inflation. And I said that we are seeing both forms of inflation these days. Today, I want to speak about what used to be called the cycle of inflation. That was a common term in the '60s through the early '80s when inflation was much, much higher than it is today. 
As you can imagine, the cycle of inflation relates to a dynamic that takes hold in an economy that relates to increasing prices and the expectation of ever increasing prices, making it such that employees demand higher wages to maintain their purchasing power and their standard of living. Those higher wages then translate into higher cost for producers which causes the producers to ask for higher prices for their products, thus reinforcing the demand for higher wages from labor, and so the cycle begins and feeds upon itself. I believe that this cycle of inflation is what we are beginning to experience today. 
Talent is scarce. Just look at the number of companies that can't find employees for their businesses, including Loews for its Hotel and Packaging businesses. Certain goods are also scarce. Here are just a few whose prices have shot up a lot. Computer chips, coffee, polyethylene pellets, tin and aluminum, soybeans, oil, natural gas and yes, jet fuel. The CRB raw Industrials Index is up by more than 50% from a year ago. Dishwashers, washing machine, dryers and refrigerators are all on month's long back orders. 
Housing prices are up approximately 25%, 25% in the past year. And of course, there's a shortage of labor in the labor market, a very, very serious shortage. And esteemed economist friend of mine said that, this year is the 11th time that the core CPI has risen more than 3% in the first 6 months of the year. On 9 of those 10 previous occasions, core CPI inflation for the full year was at least 6%. 
So by that measure, we're on track for inflation of much more than 6%. Because for the first 6 months of this year, inflation is already at 5.4%. And so it's an easy bet that inflation for all of 2021 will greatly surpass 6%. I believe that our current labor shortage is not a temporary phenomenon, and it will only be resolved with significantly higher levels of compensation, causing cost to increase, leading to ever higher inflation. 
I believe that we are now in a cycle of inflation rather than a spurt within an otherwise benign inflationary period. This year, we are moving from an extended era -- of less than 2% inflation to a year of more than 6% or 7% inflation. And due to increased labor costs, my expectation for inflation in '22 is for significantly higher inflation than the 2% level we have seen in the recent past. This inflation problem won't go away by simply wishing it away, especially with the Fed's proverbial foot still on the gas pedal, which, of course, brings us to interest rates. 
The economist, Rudi Dornbusch famously said in the '60s that in economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you ever thought that they could. Such as the case, I believe, with interest rates in the United States. They're too damn low. And the reason that they're so low is because in the past 1.5 years, the Fed has purchased over $4 trillion of government securities. That's $4 trillion of government securities that have been taken out of the market. Poof, they're gone. 
The Fed has created a squeeze of gargantuan proportions in these securities that has rippled through all the fixed income markets. The only people that own U.S. fixed income securities are people who need to own them, like banks and insurance companies, just to name a few. 
Traders may dabble in government securities, but investors won't go near them, because there isn't a bullish case to be made for investing in government securities. Today, the 10-year note yields less than 1.2%. If the rate on those nodes goes up just 13 basis points, a little over a tenth of 1%, then the entire interest carry on the bond for the year will disappear. That sounds like a miserable investment to me. 
Getting back to inflation. If the inflation rate this year is 6%, and that's a low number, I believe, then the negative real return on a 10-year note will be minus 4.75%, that's minus 4.75%. Who would want to own a security that guarantees you'll lose almost 5% of your purchasing power in a single year. Most people have already decided to either hold cash or move out the risk curve rather than lock in a real loss of such large proportions. 
The issuance of government securities will continue. For this year, the federal deficit is forecast to be $3 trillion, which means there is no end to the supply of government bonds that need to be issued to finance our government's activities. And with so much issuance of government securities on the way and with a strong economy and with inflation running so hot and with the negative real yield so unattractive, the Fed may have little choice but to take their foot off the proverbial gas panel and take away the punch bowl finally allowing interest rates to rise. There's only so long that the Fed can delay the inevitable and to me and maybe to Rudi Dornbusch of blessed memory, that time may soon be upon us."

Before we review the quarter, I want to acknowledge someone who has been instrumental to Loews' success. Andrew Tisch has decided to step away from his executive responsibilities of Loews Corporation at the end of December. I could not have asked for a better partner than Andy, who has served Lowe's with complete dedication for the last 50 years. 
During his tenure, he has successfully led a number of our subsidiaries and functional areas while also fostering open communication, collaboration and respect throughout the organization. We are all fortunate to have been the beneficiaries of his wisdom and expertise and we are grateful that he will continue to serve as Co-Chairman of the Loews' Board and is a member of the CNA Board. 
Turning to earnings. Loews' had another strong quarter across the board with good performance from each of our consolidated subsidiaries. CNA continues to be a success story for Loews. The company's underlying combined ratio decreased by 1.5 points, driven the expense ratio, which was 30.7% compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. 
The underlying loss ratio was also lower at 60.2% compared to 60.5% in the prior year. CNA's P&C gross written premiums increased by 10% and and net written premiums increased by 5%. Note that the increase in net written premiums is lower than for gross written premiums due to additional reinsurance that the company has purchased in its strategy to protect the insurance portfolio from large loss events. 
The value of this incremental protection was fully on display this past quarter with the mitigated losses CNA reported on Hurricane IDA. CNA had pretax investment income of $513 million, pretty much flat with the prior year's quarter. Limited partnerships had a great quarter, and the fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent earnings even with headwinds from the historically low interest rate environment. We continue to be very pleased with CNA's results. 
In other news, Loews Hotels made an exciting announcement in early October. The company broke ground on the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center, a new project in the tried and true entertainment hub of Arlington, Texas, which sits between Dallas and Fort Worth. When it opens in early 2024, the hotel will have 888 rooms and over 250,000 square feet of meeting and event space. 
For those not schooled in the hotel industry, that's a whole lot of rooms and a whole lot of meeting space. Once again, Loews Hotels is acting both as the owner and the operator of this project. Industry dynamics generally do not allow for companies in the hotel space to perform this double role. And as a result, Loews Hotels is a leader within this niche of the market. Playing to these strains has served Loews Hotels well, and we believe it will continue to do so. This will be Los Hotels' second property in Arlington following in the strong footsteps of live by Loews, which had a successful opening in 2019 and whose occupancy rate has generally remained strong throughout the pandemic, a testament to this market's resilience and the team's focus. The new hotel is consistent with Loews Hotels' growth strategy, which is built on pillars. The first poor is owning and operating hotels associated with immersive destinations. Loews Hotels' 2 decades long partnership with Universal Orlando is a great example of the strength of this pillar. 
Our hotels in Arlington will also clearly benefit from built-in demand drivers since our guests will have access to all the sports and entertainment destinations close to the hotels, including the Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium and the Texas Rangers Globe Life field. The second pillar of Loews Hotels' growth strategy is the company's focus on owning and operating hotels with 300-plus keys that have strong group business and ample meeting space. 
Loews Hotels has a well-earned reputation for successfully operating hotels that cater to this type of business. The 2 Arlington hotels combined will offer nearly 1,200 guestrooms and more than 300,000 square feet of meeting and event space. And these properties offer unique local experiences and are equally attractive to leisure and group customers. Those hotels has continued to see strong demand for leisure travel and improving interest for group travel. 
For the third quarter, the occupancy rate for our owned and joint venture hotels was almost 72% as opposed to about 35% in the first quarter of this year. Our resort hotels continue to do considerably better than our properties in urban settings and about 60% of Loews Hotels' rooms are in resort destinations. As the U.S. economy and the hotel industry continue their recovery, we are confident that Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews Corp. 
Next, I want to talk about Boardwalk. The demand for natural gas is increasing, and Boardwalk is well positioned to take advantage of this change. We see the increased demand coming from post increased domestic consumption and from international markets via LNG exports. Board work transports natural gas under fixed fee take-or-pay contracts with mostly investment-grade customers, which limits its commodity and volumetric risk. The company currently has $9 billion of revenue backlog with a weighted average contract life of 7 years. As the transition towards clean energy unfolds, we believe that gas will continue to be an important fuel used to roll over. 
Finally, let me update you briefly on share repurchases from July 1 through last Friday, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $337 million. Year-to-date, we've bought back 15.7 million shares for $830 million, which is 5.85% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. As I often said, we believe that Lowe's still trades at a significant discount to our view of its intrinsic value, but we'll continue to let our share repurchase activity speak for itself. 
And with that, let me hand the call over to David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $220 million or $0.85 per share compared to net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. Let me describe the quarter in a nutshe",1033,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $220 million or $0.85 per share compared to net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. Let me describe the quarter in a nutshell before getting into more detail. CNA's performance was driven by strong property casualty underwriting income before catastrophe losses, healthy net investment income and a net reserve release in the Life & Group segment. These positives were partially offset by significant weather-related catastrophe losses. 
Boardwalk's operating results benefited from strong transportation revenues generated its growth projects and increased utilization throughout its system. And Loews Hotels continue to emerge from the COVID-induced downturn with its resort properties, especially those in Florida, leading the charge. Loews Hotels generated positive net income for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Let me now dig more deeply into the third quarter and the year-over-year comparison. All 3 of our consolidated subsidiaries, CNA Board [indiscernible] those hotels recorded materially higher year-over-year net income contributions with CNA leading the charge. CNA held its earnings call earlier this morning. I would encourage you to review the transcript for more details. 
In the time, let me provide a few highlights. CNA contributed net income of $229 million, up from $192 million in Q3 2020. The main drivers of the year-over-year increase were higher property casualty underwriting income before cat losses and the abs of 3 charges that occurred last year, 2 of which were in the Life & Group segment, a charge from the unlocking of the long-term care active life reserve, a charge from strengthening the structured settlement claim reserve and a less significant charge from the early retirement of debt. 
Conversely, higher catastrophe losses than in last year's third quarter detracted from the year-over-year comparative results, focusing on property casualty underwriting income. The combination of a 6% increase in net earned premium and a 1.5 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio led to a 27% increase in CNA's underlying underwriting gain which excludes cat losses and prior year development. 
Net cat losses in the quarter were $178 million pretax, including $114 million for Hurricane Ida. Last year's Q3 cat losses were modestly lower at $160 million pretax driven by 3 Southeast Hurricanes and the idea the Midwest Directo. CNA's expense ratio was just a few years ago, hovered in the mid-30s, came in below 31%, down from 31.8% in Q3 2020 and 31.6% last. This is the lowest expense ratio posted by CNA in about 13 years. CNA's consolidated after-tax net investment income was essentially flat year-over-year as returns on limited partnership and common stock investments were robust in both periods. 
CNA conducts its annual reserve reviews for its Life & Group segment in the third quarter. Last year, the company booked a net reserve charge of $83 million pretax for its long-term care and stored settlement books of business. This year, the comparable number was a net reserve release of $38 million pretax as CNA had no change in its long-term care active life reserve a $40 million pretax release from its long-term care claims reserve and a de minimis charge related to structured settlements. We consider this favorable outcome, a further indication of CNA's enhanced insight into and prudent reserving around the long-term care business. CNA ended the quarter with total assets of $66.5 billion, shareholders' equity of $12.7 billion and consolidated statutory surplus of approximately $11.1 billion. 
Turning to Boardwalk. Boardwalk net income of $38 million, up from $20 million in Q3 2020. The main driver of the year-over-year increase was higher natural gas transportation revenue, driven like last quarter by growth projects recently placed in service and higher system utilization. 
Boardwalk's EBITDA, which is shown and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, was $186 million in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. Through 9 months, Natural gas transportation throughput increased by more than 11% year-over-year across the system. 
Turning to Loews Hotels. Loews hotels contributed net income of $13 million, a dramatic improvement from the $47 million net loss posted in Q3 2020. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, rebounded from a $38 million loss last year to a positive $59 million in Q3 2021, close to a $100 million swing. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a dramatic revenue increase as all properties, including all 9,000 rooms at the Universal Orlando Resort were open for the full quarter. This was the first time all 9,000 rooms in Orlando were open for a full quarter. 
On Page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement, there is a good snapshot of Loews Hotels year-over-year and sequential operational improvement, which highlights the drivers of the company's revenue increases during this COVID period. With more available rooms higher occupancy and healthy average daily rates, revenues have climbed markedly since the depths of the pandemic. We have invested $32 million in Loews Hotels year-to-date, all in the first quarter. Given the company's stronger-than-expected cash flow, the parent company does not expect to invest any further cash in Loews Hotels during the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the Corporate segment. The parent company's investment portfolio generated a pretax net investment loss of $30 million as compared to income of $23 million last year. The loss stemmed from the performance of the equity portfolio. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.6 billion at quarter end with about 80% in cash and equivalents. 
During the quarter, as Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock for $333 million, and we received about $92 million in dividends from CNA. After quarter end, we spent less than $5 million repurchasing our stock. As of last Friday, there were under 254 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding, down about 6% since the beginning of the year and about 25% over the past 5 years. Loews continues to be characterized by strong cash flow into the parent company and an extremely liquid balance sheet with cash and investments far exceeding parent company debt. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim. Jim?"

I believe this transition will be measured in decades. I'm not alone in my belief that over the next several years, demand for natural gas will increase both domestically and also internationally. 
Most forecasts called for natural gas production in the United States to increase over the next 3 decades by anywhere from 15% to 40%. Natural gas is an important energy source that has meaningfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., CO2 emissions from power generation are down 40% over the last 20 years as power plants switched from coal to natural gas. Energy production needs to be low cost, reliable and green. We need to approach the energy transition in a rational and balanced way, and natural gas is playing an important role in the clean, low-cost reliable option. 
Currently, global demand growth for natural gas is driven by China and India where coal still accounts for more than 60% of their power generation. Energy transition targets in those countries will likely accelerate [indiscernible] demand to replace coal usage. U.S. LNG is well positioned to meet that demand. In the U.S., natural gas has an important role to play in reducing emissions through the displacement of coal and as a backup to renewable energy by providing reliable power for times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. 
In the coming decades, the need for electricity will increase because of the electrification of automobiles. Gas power generation will be needed because wind and solar resources are intermittent. As I said, the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine, and current battery technology can now provide more than several hours of electrical service, that's hardly enough storage. Gas power generation is reliable, dispatchable and gas can be stored safely and cost effectively. And while the world is focused on our reliance on carbon-based fuel for power generation, natural gas is also a raw material for a number of items that we rely on every day. There is no replacement for natural gas as a raw material. 
Boardwalk is well positioned to take advantage of higher industrial demand for natural gas and growth in the LNG export market. Boardwalk has also invested in making operations more environmentally friendly by reducing methane emissions. Considering the productive life of oil and natural gas wells, we, as a nation are going to have to continue adding productive hydrocarbon capacity for years and years to come. We believe that natural gas will continue to be an important fuel and raw material for the U.S. and the world."

At the end of 2017, CNA traded about $53 per share, whereas on Friday, it traded less than $45 per share. The stock price, notwithstanding CNA today is a much stronger company than it was 3.5 years ago. Over that time, CNA has meaningfully reduced its expense ratio has made steady improvement in its underlying loss ratio, has built a deep underwriting culture, optimized distribution by expanding its broker network and continues to attract, develop and retain top talent. Additionally, the company maintains a robust balance sheet through its conservative capital structure and debt profile. 
The company has ample liquidity and what S&P refers to as AAA level of capital. Its investment portfolio has a carrying value of about $50 billion. We work with CNA to maintain a high-quality portfolio with an average A credit rating. The portfolio also has consistent fixed income earnings, solid limited partnerships and common equity returns. Of course, no discussion of CNA would be complete without talking about long-term care. The company has worked cordlessly to mitigate the risk there. Something I believe the stock market does not give CNA enough credit for. 
On their call earlier today, CNA announced the findings of their annual review of the long-term care book of business. Here are some of the highlights. CNA has actively managed the portfolio to reduce policy count and level of benefits while working to provide better care for their policyholders. The company closed the group book of business in 2016. So no new policies have been issued since then, which has helped drive a 35% reduction in policies in force since year-end 2015. 
CNA has initiated several innovative benefit reduction strategies, resulting in over 60,000 policyholders electing to reduce their benefits since 2017. 
In conclusion and to finally answer your question, over the last 12 months, CNA earned about $1.2 billion, which means that CNA is trading at about 10x net income in the context of the S&P 500 trading at more than twice that multiple, CNA seems to me to be cheap."

So both Altium and Loews hotels have had labor shortages. For example, at 1 point during the pandemic, the management teams at some of Loews Hotels as properties were making bad beds and cleaning rooms. Luckily, that situation is improving. Loews Hot",876,"Yes. So both Altium and Loews hotels have had labor shortages. For example, at 1 point during the pandemic, the management teams at some of Loews Hotels as properties were making bad beds and cleaning rooms. Luckily, that situation is improving. Loews Hotels has had a 20% increase in headcount since the end of the second quarter and more than double the active headcount at the beginning of the year. 2/3 of Loews Hotels' current workforce was with the company prior to the pandemic. 
So while onboarding team members is an ongoing effort, the company is lucky to  have had so many team members remain active throughout the pandemic or return to Loews after a leave of absence. In terms of Altium labor continuity continues to be a challenge in some manufacturing locations. To address this challenge, Altium is offering sign on retention and employee referral bonuses. They have also adjusted base wages to keep up with the market. Overall, while labor shortages have impacted a few of our subsidiaries, we are seeing gradual improvement in the labor situation. 
And Mary, I think that's the end of our questions. So I'd just like to make a few comments on what I see going on in the economy. For the past 2 quarters, I've spoken about inflation and interest rates. Both times, I spoke about how I thought we are beginning a cycle of inflation and how interest rates were much too low. And even though interest rates on 10-year notes have basically doubled in the past 12 months, those rates are still too low. Although it's been developing for several quarters, what is currently in plain view or shortages. Just take a look at what's happening to the likes of computer chips to containers, to labor, to trucking and to shipping. There's no quick fix to any of these in the short term, along with shortages come higher prices, which means inflation. 
The current CPI is at 5.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's the highest 12-month CPI growth rate since December of 1990, that's almost 31 years ago. When the CPI was at that level in 1990, 10-year notes yielded 8%. Today, they are 1.6%. The old saying applies here. When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. We are still digging our hole deeper and deeper by adding monetary and fiscal stimulus to our economy. Currently, there's been over $5 trillion of fiscal stimulus to the economy since the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, the Fed has purchased $5 trillion of government securities in that time. And that [indiscernible] statistic called Money supply has increased at an annual rate of over 20% since the start of the pandemic. Certainly, for those who remember him, Milton Friedman would be appalled. As a country, the Fed has hooked us on an opiate called Cheap Money. This has been going on since the financial crisis of '08 and 13 years later, we're still hooked on it. Today, Fed funds are at 7 basis points, that's in the context of 5.4% inflation. 
To be any more stimulative, Fed funds would have to be negative. Both the Fed and Congress have been too stimulative. The economy has responded in textbook fashion to all the stimulus. It has powered ahead. In fact, arguably, it has responded too well such that we have had high inflation for the past year. But as I made clear in my prior comments, this isn't 1 and done for inflation. We are in a cycle inflation, where higher prices lead to higher wage demands, which leads to higher costs for businesses, which leads to higher prices, and so the cycle continues. 
So what can be done? There are 2 things. First, the Fed needs to stop buying government securities and move interest rates higher. That means beginning the process of raising short-term interest rates so that over time, interest rates will normalize. After all, even though the current level of interest rates would ordinarily indicate that the economy is on life support, we are at the polar opposite. There's strong growth in the economy. It's long past time to correct this divergence. 
The second thing to do is to stop the fiscal stimulus. The pandemic stimulus so far has been highly successful. The economy has been growing well for the past few quarters, and the 24-month average savings rate is 14%. That's the highest level that statistic has ever been since the series was started in 1959. Think of the high savings rate of fuel that the consumer has in their tank the power the consumption for the next several quarters. So there's no more need for stimulus with so much accumulated savings. Additional stimulus will only exacerbate the inflationary problems that now plague us. 
So there you have it. We have a problem with inflation, and the cures come from simple implementation of basic monetary and fiscal policies that are well known to all. The time to act is now the longer the inflation is allowed to faster and grow the deeper will be our problems in the future. Neither the Fed nor the administration are doing us any favors in their delay. 
Back to you, Mary."

Before we review the quarter, I want to acknowledge someone who has been instrumental to Loews' success. Andrew Tisch has decided to step away from his executive responsibilities of Loews Corporation at the end of December. I could not have asked for a better partner than Andy, who has served Lowe's with complete dedication for the last 50 years.  
During his tenure, he has successfully led a number of our subsidiaries and functional areas while also fostering open communication, collaboration and respect throughout the organization. We are all fortunate to have been the beneficiaries of his wisdom and expertise and we are grateful that he will continue to serve as Co-Chairman of the Loews' Board and is a member of the CNA Board.  
Turning to earnings. Loews' had another strong quarter across the board with good performance from each of our consolidated subsidiaries. CNA continues to be a success story for Loews. The company's underlying combined ratio decreased by 1.5 points, driven the expense ratio, which was 30.7% compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio was also lower at 60.2% compared to 60.5% in the prior year. 
CNA's P&C gross written premiums increased by 10% and net written premiums increased by 5%. Note that the increase in net written premiums is lower than for gross written premiums due to additional reinsurance that the company has purchased in its strategy to protect the insurance portfolio from large loss events.  
The value of this incremental protection was fully on display this past quarter with the mitigated losses CNA reported on Hurricane Ida. CNA had pretax investment income of $513 million, pretty much flat with the prior year's quarter. Limited partnerships had a great quarter, and the fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent earnings even with headwinds from the historically low interest rate environment. We continue to be very pleased with CNA's results.  
In other news, Loews Hotels made an exciting announcement in early October. The company broke ground on the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center, a new project in the tried and true entertainment hub of Arlington, Texas, which sits between Dallas and Fort Worth. When it opens in early 2024, the hotel will have 888 rooms and over 250,000 square feet of meeting and event space.  
For those not schooled in the hotel industry, that's a whole lot of rooms and a whole lot of meeting space. Once again, Loews Hotels is acting both as the owner and the operator of this project. Industry dynamics generally do not allow for companies in the hotel space to perform this double role. And as a result, Loews Hotels is a leader within this niche of the market, playing to these strengths has served Loews Hotels well, and we believe it will continue to do so. 
This will be Loews Hotels' second property in Arlington following in the strong footsteps of Live! By Loews, which had a successful opening in 2019 and whose occupancy rate has generally remained strong throughout the pandemic, a testament to this market's resilience and the team's focus. 
The new hotel is consistent with Loews Hotels' growth strategy, which is built on pillars. The first pillar is owning and operating hotels associated with immersive destinations. Loews Hotels' 2 decades long partnership with Universal Orlando is a great example of the strength of this pillar.  
Our hotels in Arlington will also clearly benefit from built-in demand drivers since our guests will have access to all the sports and entertainment destinations close to the hotels, including the Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium and the Texas Rangers Globe Life field. 
The second pillar of Loews Hotels' growth strategy is the company's focus on owning and operating hotels with 300-plus keys that have strong group business and ample meeting space. Loews Hotels has a well-earned reputation for successfully operating hotels that cater to this type of business. 
The 2 Arlington hotels combined will offer nearly 1,200 guestrooms and more than 300,000 square feet of meeting and event space. And these properties offer unique local experiences and are equally attractive to leisure and group customers. Loews Hotels has continued to see strong demand for leisure travel and improving interest for group travel.  
For the third quarter, the occupancy rate for our owned and joint venture hotels was almost 72% as opposed to about 35% in the first quarter of this year. Our resort hotels continue to do considerably better than our properties in urban settings and about 60% of Loews Hotels' rooms are in resort destinations. As the U.S. economy and the hotel industry continue their recovery, we are confident that Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews Corp. 
Next, I want to talk about Boardwalk. The demand for natural gas is increasing, and Boardwalk is well positioned to take advantage of this change. We see the increased demand coming from -- increased domestic consumption and from international markets via LNG exports. Boardwalk transports natural gas under fixed fee take-or-pay contracts with mostly investment-grade customers, which limits its commodity and volumetric risk. 
The company currently has $9 billion of revenue backlog with a weighted average contract life of 7 years. As the transition towards clean energy unfolds, we believe that gas will continue to be an important fuel used the world over.  
Finally, let me update you briefly on share repurchases from July 1 through last Friday, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $337 million. Year-to-date, we've bought back 15.7 million shares for $830 million, which is 5.85% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
As I often said, we believe that Lowe's still trades at a significant discount to our view of its intrinsic value, but we'll continue to let our share repurchase activity speak for itself.  
And with that, let me hand the call over to David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $220 million or $0.85 per share compared to net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. Let me describe the quarter in a nutshe",1031,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $220 million or $0.85 per share compared to net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. Let me describe the quarter in a nutshell before getting into more detail. 
CNA's performance was driven by strong property casualty underwriting income before catastrophe losses, healthy net investment income and a net reserve release in the Life & Group segment. These positives were partially offset by significant weather-related catastrophe losses.  
Boardwalk's operating results benefited from strong transportation revenues generated its growth projects and increased utilization throughout its system. And Loews Hotels continue to emerge from the COVID-induced downturn with its resort properties, especially those in Florida, leading the charge. Loews Hotels generated positive net income for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Let me now dig more deeply into the third quarter and the year-over-year comparison. All 3 of our consolidated subsidiaries, CNA Boardwalk, and Loews Hotels recorded materially higher year-over-year net income contributions with CNA leading the charge. CNA held its earnings call earlier this morning. I would encourage you to review the transcript for more details. 
In the meantime, let me provide a few highlights. CNA contributed net income of $229 million, up from $192 million in Q3 2020. The main drivers of the year-over-year increase were higher property casualty underwriting income before cat losses and the absence of 3 charges that occurred last year, 2 of which were in the Life & Group segment, a charge from the unlocking of the long-term care active life reserve, a charge from strengthening the structured settlement claim reserve and a less significant charge from the early retirement of debt. 
Conversely, higher catastrophe losses than in last year's third quarter detracted from the year-over-year comparative results, focusing on property casualty underwriting income. The combination of a 6% increase in net earned premium and a 1.5 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio led to a 27% increase in CNA's underlying underwriting gain which excludes cat losses and prior year development. 
Net cat losses in the quarter were $178 million pretax, including $114 million for Hurricane Ida. Last year's Q3 cat losses were modestly lower at $160 million pretax driven by 3 Southeast hurricanes and the Midwest derecho. CNA's expense ratio was just a few years ago, hovered in the mid-30s, came in below 31%, down from 31.8% in Q3 2020 and 31.6% last. This is the lowest expense ratio posted by CNA in about 13 years. CNA's consolidated after-tax net investment income was essentially flat year-over-year as returns on limited partnership and common stock investments were robust in both periods. 
CNA conducts its annual reserve reviews for its Life & Group segment in the third quarter. Last year, the company booked a net reserve charge of $83 million pretax for its long-term care and stored settlement books of business. This year, the comparable number was a net reserve release of $38 million pretax as CNA had no change in its long-term care active life reserve a $40 million pretax release from its long-term care claims reserve and a de minimis charge related to structured settlements. We consider this favorable outcome, a further indication of CNA's enhanced insight into and prudent reserving around the long-term care business. CNA ended the quarter with total assets of $66.5 billion, shareholders' equity of $12.7 billion and consolidated statutory surplus of approximately $11.1 billion. 
Turning to Boardwalk. Boardwalk net income of $38 million, up from $20 million in Q3 2020. The main driver of the year-over-year increase was higher natural gas transportation revenue, driven like last quarter by growth projects recently placed in service and higher system utilization. 
Boardwalk's EBITDA, which is shown and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, was $186 million in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. Through 9 months, Natural gas transportation throughput increased by more than 11% year-over-year across the system. 
Turning to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, a dramatic improvement from the $47 million net loss posted in Q3 2020. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, rebounded from a $38 million loss last year to a positive $59 million in Q3 2021, close to a $100 million swing. 
The year-over-year improvement was driven by a dramatic revenue increase as all properties, including all 9,000 rooms at the Universal Orlando Resort were open for the full quarter. This was the first time all 9,000 rooms in Orlando were open for a full quarter. 
On Page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement, there is a good snapshot of Loews Hotels year-over-year and sequential operational improvement, which highlights the drivers of the company's revenue increases during this COVID period. With more available rooms, higher occupancy and healthy average daily rates, revenues have climbed markedly since the depths of the pandemic. 
We have invested $32 million in Loews Hotels year-to-date, all in the first quarter. Given the company's stronger-than-expected cash flow, the parent company does not expect to invest any further cash in Loews Hotels during the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the Corporate segment. The parent company's investment portfolio generated a pretax net investment loss of $30 million as compared to income of $23 million last year. The loss stemmed from the performance of the equity portfolio. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $3.6 billion at quarter end with about 80% in cash and equivalents. 
During the quarter, as Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock for $333 million, and we received about $92 million in dividends from CNA. After quarter end, we spent less than $5 million repurchasing our stock. As of last Friday, there were under 254 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding, down about 6% since the beginning of the year and about 25% over the past 5 years. Loews continues to be characterized by strong cash flow into the parent company and an extremely liquid balance sheet with cash and investments far exceeding parent company debt. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim. Jim?"

I believe this transition will be measured in decades. I'm not alone in my belief that over the next several years, demand for natural gas will increase both domestically and also internationally. 
Most forecasts called for natural gas production in the United States to increase over the next 3 decades by anywhere from 15% to 40%. Natural gas is an important energy source that has meaningfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., CO2 emissions from power generation are down 40% over the last 20 years as power plants switched from coal to natural gas. Energy production needs to be low cost, reliable and green. We need to approach the energy transition in a rational and balanced way, and natural gas is playing an important role in the clean, low-cost reliable option. 
Currently, global demand growth for natural gas is driven by China and India where coal still accounts for more than 60% of their power generation. Energy transition targets in those countries will likely accelerate natural gas demand to replace coal usage. U.S. LNG is well positioned to meet that demand. 
In the U.S., natural gas has an important role to play in reducing emissions through the displacement of coal and as a backup to renewable energy by providing reliable power for times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. 
In the coming decades, the need for electricity will increase because of the electrification of automobiles. Gas power generation will be needed because wind and solar resources are intermittent. As I said, the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine, and current battery technology can not provide more than several hours of electrical service, that's hardly enough storage. 
Gas power generation is reliable, dispatchable and gas can be stored safely and cost effectively. And while the world is focused on our reliance on carbon-based fuel for power generation, natural gas is also a raw material for a number of items that we rely on every day. There is no replacement for natural gas as a raw material. 
Boardwalk is well positioned to take advantage of higher industrial demand for natural gas and growth in the LNG export market. Boardwalk has also invested in making operations more environmentally friendly by reducing methane emissions. Considering the productive life of oil and natural gas wells, we, as a nation are going to have to continue adding productive hydrocarbon capacity for years and years to come. We believe that natural gas will continue to be an important fuel and raw material for the U.S. and the world."

At the end of 2017, CNA traded about $53 per share, whereas on Friday, it traded for less than $45 per share. The stock price, notwithstanding CNA today is a much stronger company than it was 3.5 years ago. 
Over that time, CNA has meaningfully reduced its expense ratio, has made steady improvement in its underlying loss ratio, has built a deep underwriting culture, optimized distribution by expanding its broker network and continues to attract, develop and retain top talent. Additionally, the company maintains a robust balance sheet through its conservative capital structure and debt profile. 
The company has ample liquidity and what S&P refers to as AAA level of capital. Its investment portfolio has a carrying value of about $50 billion. We work with CNA to maintain a high-quality portfolio with an average A credit rating. The portfolio also has consistent fixed income earnings, solid limited partnerships and common equity returns. Of course, no discussion of CNA would be complete without talking about long-term care. The company has worked tirelessly to mitigate the risks there. Something I believe the stock market does not give CNA enough credit for. 
On their call earlier today, CNA announced the findings of their annual review of the long-term care book of business. Here are some of the highlights. CNA has actively managed the portfolio to reduce policy count and level of benefits while working to provide better care for their policyholders. The company closed the group book of business in 2016. So no new policies have been issued since then, which has helped drive a 35% reduction in policies in force since year-end 2015. 
CNA has initiated several innovative benefit reduction strategies, resulting in over 60,000 policyholders electing to reduce their benefits since 2017. 
In conclusion and to finally answer your question, over the last 12 months, CNA earned about $1.2 billion, which means that CNA is trading at about 10x net income in the context of the S&P 500 trading at more than twice that multiple, CNA seems to me to be dirt cheap."

For example, at 1 point during the pandemic, the management teams at some of Loews Hotels' properties were making beds and cleaning rooms. Luckily, that situation is improving. Loews Hotels has had a 20% increase in headcount since the end of the second quarter and more than double the active headcount at the beginning of the year. 2/3 of Loews Hotels' current workforce was with the company prior to the pandemic. 
So while onboarding team members is an ongoing effort, the company is lucky to  have had so many team members remain active throughout the pandemic or return to Loews after a leave of absence. 
In terms of Altium labor continuity continues to be a challenge in some manufacturing locations. To address this challenge, Altium is offering sign on retention and employee referral bonuses. They have also adjusted base wages to keep up with the market. Overall, while labor shortages have impacted a few of our subsidiaries, we are seeing gradual improvement in the labor situation. 
And Mary, I think that's the end of our questions. So I'd just like to make a few comments on what I see going on in the economy. For the past 2 quarters, I've spoken about inflation and interest rates. Both times, I spoke about how I thought we are beginning a cycle of inflation and how interest rates were much too low. And even though interest rates on 10-year notes have basically doubled in the past 12 months, those rates are still too low. 
Although it's been developing for several quarters, what is currently in plain view or shortages. Just take a look at what's happening to the likes of computer chips to containers, to labor, to trucking and to shipping. There's no quick fix to any of these in the short term, along with shortages come higher prices, which means inflation. 
The current CPI is at 5.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's the highest 12-month CPI growth rate since December of 1990, that's almost 31 years ago. When the CPI was at that level in 1990, 10-year notes yielded 8%. Today, they are 1.6%. The old saying applies here, when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. We are still digging our hole deeper and deeper by adding monetary and fiscal stimulus to our economy. Currently, there's been over $5 trillion of fiscal stimulus to the economy since the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, the Fed has purchased $5 trillion of government securities in that time. And that quaint statistic called money supply has increased at an annual rate of over 20% since the start of the pandemic. 
Certainly, for those who remember him, Milton Friedman would be appalled. As a country, the Fed has hooked us on an opiate called cheap money. This has been going on since the financial crisis of '08 and 13 years later, we're still hooked on it. Today, Fed funds are at 7 basis points, that's in the context of 5.4% inflation. 
To be any more stimulative, Fed funds would have to be negative. Both the Fed and Congress have been too stimulative. The economy has responded in textbook fashion to all the stimulus. It has powered ahead. In fact, arguably, it has responded too well such that we have had high inflation for the past year. But as I made clear in my prior comments, this isn't one and done for inflation. We are in a cycle inflation, where higher prices lead to higher wage demands, which leads to higher costs for businesses, which leads to higher prices, and so the cycle continues. 
So what can be done? There are 2 things. First, the Fed needs to stop buying government securities and move interest rates higher. That means beginning the process of raising short-term interest rates so that over time, interest rates will normalize. After all, even though the current level of interest rates would ordinarily indicate that the economy is on life support, we are at the polar opposite. There's strong growth in the economy. It's long past time to correct this divergence. 
The second thing to do is to stop the fiscal stimulus. The pandemic stimulus so far has been highly successful. The economy has been growing well for the past few quarters, and the 24-month average savings rate is 14%. That's the highest level that statistic has ever been since the series was started in 1959. Think of the high savings rate of fuel that the consumer has in their tank the power the consumption for the next several quarters. So there's no more need for stimulus with so much accumulated savings. Additional stimulus will only exacerbate the inflationary problems that now plague us. 
So there you have it. We have a problem with inflation, and the cures come from simple implementation of basic monetary and fiscal policies that are well known to all. The time to act is now the longer the inflation is allowed to faster and grow the deeper will be our problems in the future. Neither the Fed nor the administration are doing us any favors in their delay. 
Back to you, Mary."
