Before we dive into the presentation, I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for their resilience and strong performance in 2020. 
In a year challenged by the pandemic, they work tirelessly day in and day out to protect each other into operations delivering for our customers. They remain disciplined on cost management, executed in the face of many challenges and help to strengthen our financial position and ultimately deliver results for our shareholders. 
I'm proud of our team and the performance we've delivered, as you can see on Slide 3. Total sales for the year were $7.6 billion. This was driven largely by international freight market, services and recovering in transit. But offset by global disruption due to the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies. 
In 2020, we exceeded expectations by delivering a 200 basis point margin improvement in Transit, where our team continues to drive improved project execution, productivity and cost actions. 
Total cash conversion was strong, with cash flow from operations of $784 million, which included roughly $220 million in onetime impacts related to transaction, restructuring and litigation expenses. 
Cash generation was driven in part by good working capital management, this allowed us to deliver on our financial priorities of investing in the business, paying down more than $300 million in debt, which includes the tax obligation to general electric, and returning roughly $300 million of capital to shareholders. 
Total multiyear backlog was over $21 billion, and up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. 
We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $3.79. Our teams continue to take action to manage what's in our control, protect the long-term growth of the company and improved competitiveness while delivering shareholder value. 
In terms of synergies, we've delivered over $150 million in net synergies during 2020, and we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies in 2021. 
To achieve these goals, we are taking further actions on structural costs. In 2020, we reduced headcount by 12%. And we drove a 10% reduction across our operational footprint, and we have started a lean reset across the company to remove waste maximize competitiveness across our product lines and advance our culture of continuous improvement. 
Since the GE Transportation merger, total rooftops have been reduced by more than 30% and total headcount by 16%. 
And to date, we have exited more than 90% of the GE shared services ahead of schedule. 
Throughout the year, we also never lost sight of investing in growth. We extended our leadership position in autonomous operations, helping more than 70 customers successfully meet the deadline for positive train control. 
We also closed a strategic digital order for trip Optimizer, 0 to 0. This is an advanced technology that allows the customer to start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop the train automatically using various controls that are integrated with positive train control. 
In 2020, we also further strengthened our role as leaders in decarbonizing global rail transportation by developing new technologies that reduce emissions and dry fuel efficiency. 
We've built, shipped and tested the world's first savvy hall battery electric locomotive. We're proud to share this locomotives currently in revenue, operating service with BNS South in California, and it will be a game changer in decarbonizing rail. 
In 2020, we extended battery technology to passengers as well by closing a significant deal with New York City transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. 
We have also reduced the weight, life cycle costs and braking distance of a transit train with solutions like Metroplex, for which we secured a key order in Singapore. 
And finally, we are improving air quality and site transit cars with the launch of Blue future and advanced air filtration system. And as we highlighted last quarter, our order pipeline continues to strengthen, and we started to see that pipeline convert in the fourth quarter. 
Book-to-bill at the end of the quarter was 0.99 versus 0.89 in the third quarter. And we will continue to have positive momentum throughout 2021. Global freight volumes and equipment utilization have sequentially improved since the trough in the second quarter, and we are continuing to see uneven yet continued sequential recovery. 
This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic international locomotive order. And throughout the year, built on our strong installed base, closing several long-term service agreements. 
We have also expanded our global technology footprint in key regions, like Americas, Russia, CIS and India. 
Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec in the market. 
Quarter-to-date, we closed a significant multiyear order for modernizations and long-term service agreements. And we're well positioned for MoDs growth, overhauls and parts demand, especially as railroads recover. 
Based on these factors and orders, Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth, and continue to perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees in the short and long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. Pat?"

Our execution through a very challenging year demonstrated our ability to move quickly to reduce costs, generate strong cash flow, strengthen our financial position allocate capital and position Wabtec for long-term profitable growth. 
Now turning to Slide 4. I'll review the fourth quarter in more detail. 
Sales continued to recover sequentially in both freight and transit, up 9% from the third quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 15% decrease versus the prior year, driven mainly from the disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by the pandemic. 
For the quarter, operating income was $161 million, and adjusted operating income was $283 million, which was down 22% year-over-year. 
Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $122 million, of which $71 million was for noncash amortization and $51 million of costs related to onetime it synergy related expenses, along with restructuring due to on 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our U.K. operations. Adjusted operating margin was lower than the fourth quarter last year, mainly driven by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities stemming from roughly 40% fewer locomotive deliveries as well as sales mix impacted from lower parts and higher level of transit sales. 
During the fourth quarter, we took additional and aggressive operational and structural cost actions that will continue to drive margin improvement sequentially through 2021. Now looking forward, we expect a seasonal first quarter with some volume impacts, as you have heard our customers describe. That said, for the full year, we expect sequential improvement to result in a higher adjusted operating margin and profitable growth across both our freight and transit segments. 
At December 31, our multiyear backlog was $21.6 billion, up about $200 million quarter-over-quarter, our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, was $5.5 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A expense declined 22% year-over-year to $205 million. This was the result of swift cost actions during the downturn and excludes $30 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. 
SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. 
Amortization expenses were $71 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $280 million and depreciation expense of about $180 million. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% we expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate of about 26%. 
In the fourth quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.98. 
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 20% from last year to $1.3 billion but were up 8% sequentially from the third quarter as freight end markets continue to recover globally. 
In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up sequentially from the third quarter but down 32% year-over-year, mainly due to timing of locomotive deliveries, which we have discussed can often vary quarter-to-quarter. 
In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved 7% sequentially, but were down slightly versus the same period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued high locomotive parkings as well as the timing of overhauls. 
We expect our services sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes, unparking of locomotives and higher demand for Mods. Digital electronics sales were down 22% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption. Yet we closed the fourth quarter with strong order momentum and continue to see significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers focus on safety and improve productivity. 
Component sales were down 22% year-over-year. This is compared to a 58% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business, since the third quarter, we have seen signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. 
Freight segment adjusted operating income was $218 million an adjusted margin of 16.3%. 
The benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix in services and digital electronics as well as under absorption of costs. 
As always, we will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs as part of our lean efforts. 
Finally, segment backlog was $17.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased at 2% year-over-year to $684 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. 
OE sales were up 2% year-over-year demonstrating continued investments in green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were down 6% from last year. 
However, we remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve transit ridership and services increase globally. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which was up 40% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 11.3%. 
Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost, improve project execution and risk management, as noted by our strong operating performance. We are pleased with the momentum underway, and we'll continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. 
Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion, which was up about 5% versus last quarter. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a year of significant challenges, we generated $784 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. 
Cash flow was driven by conversion of net income and good working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. 
Of note, we had about $220 million of onetime impacts on cash flow during the year, mainly due to prior restructuring transaction and litigation charges. 
Restructuring costs in 2021 will result in further structural cost reductions, but we expect the overall level of onetime impacts to be less for the full year, total CapEx was $136 million. 
In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on our strategic plans and capital allocation priorities. 
Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduce debt by about $190 million, bringing our total debt down by $723 million since the merger with GE transportation. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made our first payment to GE of $115 million per our Tax Matters agreement. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and our liquidity is at a robust $1.9 billion. 
Over the course of the year, we returned $300 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. And as we announced this morning, our Board approved a renewal on our share buyback authorization for up to $500 million. 
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael."

Let's look at some of the segment dynamics setting to 2021. Starting with rate by product line. 
North America freight has mostly gone through a reset our services business has recovered, and we're working through the trough in our OE business. Due to locomotive deliveries are expected in North America in 2021. 
Total locomotive deliveries will be down roughly 35% year-over-year, driven mainly by North American locomotive deliveries, down by more than 100 units versus 2020. And this volume headwinds will create margin pressure due to under absorption at our manufacturing facilities. 
Our international pipeline remains strong and order momentum continues to build. In mining, we are optimistic as conditions are continuing to improve. When it comes to North America railcar built, railcars are coming back into use. 
Roughly 24% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage, which is similar to a pre co bid level. [indiscernible] are taking continued steps to slow down production and forecast estimates that railcar build for this year to be around 25,000 cars.
In the freight services, we are seeing year-over-year pressure on parts due to higher levels of parking. Demand for reliability and productivity will improve as railroads continue to recover, which, as I shared earlier, put us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls and parts demand. 
In digital electronics, we're focused on growing PTC internationally. In 2021, we have contracts to install over 3,000 horsepower per ton upgrades to our trip Optimizer systems a new record. 
While we anticipate North American CapEx budgets to remain constrained, the long-term outlook is strong. Now transitioning to Transit, we expect growth on both OE and aftermarket as ridership recovers from historic wells. 
Infrastructure spending, we'll continue in line with green initiatives as governments continue to churn to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient means of transport. And I'll expand on that in just a minute. 
For 2021, we expect revenues in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30, and cash conversion is expected to be greater than 90% for the full year. 
Across our segments, recovery is underway and will continue as customers experience volume growth and reinvest in their operations. We are seeing it already in some areas, and we expect sequential improvement in both aftermarket, services and international locomotives. 
In 2021, we expect orders to exceed anticipated sales, putting Wabtec in an even stronger position to drive profitable growth. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the importance of sustainability in the strategic direction we're driving as a company. 
At Wabtec, we are determined to have a lasting impact on our industry and the world. Last year, we launched the company's first sustainability report and provided a detailed look at how we're building a more sustainable future by strengthening our corporate governance framework, which guides how we operate, how we innovate and how we drive growth. We also laid out our strategy on how we're taking on some of the world's toughest challenges, including climate change and automation by creating cleaner more fuel filion solutions like the Flex drive locomotive. 
As noted earlier, this is the world's first battery electric locomotive and is currently being tested in revenue service by BNSF in California. 
So far, we're seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30%, with significant interest from customers in North America and internationally. 
We're also reducing our own carbon footprint, driving down energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities. And when it comes to our employees, we're building a company culture grounded in meritocracy and integrity, one that embraces diversity in all forms and invest in its people and communities. 
To deliver on this vision, we outlined specific targets for how we plan to drive measurable impact. Our 30x30 strategy sets the fine metrics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more by at least 30% by 2030, making our commitment clear to both our customers and our shareholders. 
We are making good advancement on these efforts, as you can see here and throughout our report. As we continue to build an even stronger wap back, we will be a driving force in transitioning the industry to a more sustainable future. 
And with that, let's turn to Slide 10. As you've heard this morning, our strategic plan has empowered us to innovate and has given us a clear framework to execute on our commitments to generate strong cash flow and to drive continued shareholder value. And it will continue to guide us as we expand our international installed base as we accelerate growth in digital electronics and services while further transforming our transit business. 
We are 2 years into our integration we have delivered on our synergies. We have delivered on increased shareholder value, and we've positioned Wabtec and our customers for competitive advantage. Heading into 2021, and we will drive margin expansion through prioritize cost actions and continue to invest in growth, creating new technologies that strengthen our leadership position on decarbonization and automation with the same determination and focus that has brought us here today. 
Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to once again personally thank every member of the Wabtec team for what they have delivered in 2020 and and the work they will continue to deliver in 2021. Thank you.

In the fourth quarter, we saw book-to-bill that increased 0.99 and that's an improvement versus the average for the year, which was around 0.91. 
As we have said, I think our pipeline of deals continues to strengthen. We're off to a strong start for the year.

So at this point, I think we'll see sequential improvement on volume as a result of continued on parking locomotives and freight cars. I think it's important to mention here. 
I think we -- as we look at quarter-to-date, the backlog coverage for the year is better than we had a year ago. 
But we're still sitting on what all a significant higher number of locomotive spark versus pre-COVID level. I think Donato Element I would offer you there is the PSR headwinds that we saw in the past couple of years impacting demand.

Before we dive into the presentation, I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for their resilience and strong performance in 2020. 
In a year challenged by the pandemic, they work tirelessly day in and day out to protect each other into operations delivering for our customers. They remain disciplined on cost management, executed in the face of many challenges and help to strengthen our financial position and ultimately deliver results for our shareholders. 
I'm proud of our team and the performance we've delivered, as you can see on Slide 3. Total sales for the year were $7.6 billion. This was driven largely by international freight market, services and recovering in transit. But offset by global disruption due to the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies. 
In 2020, we exceeded expectations by delivering a 200 basis point margin improvement in Transit, where our team continues to drive improved project execution, productivity and cost actions. 
Total cash conversion was strong, with cash flow from operations of $784 million, which included roughly $220 million in onetime impacts related to transaction, restructuring and litigation expenses. 
Cash generation was driven in part by good working capital management, this allowed us to deliver on our financial priorities of investing in the business, paying down more than $300 million in debt, which includes the tax obligation to general electric, and returning roughly $300 million of capital to shareholders. 
Total multiyear backlog was over $21 billion, and up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. 
We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $3.79. Our teams continue to take action to manage what's in our control, protect the long-term growth of the company and improved competitiveness while delivering shareholder value. 
In terms of synergies, we've delivered over $150 million in net synergies during 2020, and we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies in 2021. 
To achieve these goals, we are taking further actions on structural costs. In 2020, we reduced headcount by 12%. And we drove a 10% reduction across our operational footprint, and we have started a lean reset across the company to remove waste maximize competitiveness across our product lines and advance our culture of continuous improvement. 
Since the GE Transportation merger, total rooftops have been reduced by more than 30% and total headcount by 16%. 
And to date, we have exited more than 90% of the GE shared services ahead of schedule. 
Throughout the year, we also never lost sight of investing in growth. We extended our leadership position in autonomous operations, helping more than 70 customers successfully meet the deadline for positive train control. 
We also closed a strategic digital order for trip Optimizer, 0 to 0. This is an advanced technology that allows the customer to start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop the train automatically using various controls that are integrated with positive train control. 
In 2020, we also further strengthened our role as leaders in decarbonizing global rail transportation by developing new technologies that reduce emissions and dry fuel efficiency. 
We've built, shipped and tested the world's first savvy hall battery electric locomotive. We're proud to share this locomotives currently in revenue, operating service with BNS South in California, and it will be a game changer in decarbonizing rail. 
In 2020, we extended battery technology to passengers as well by closing a significant deal with New York City transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint. 
We have also reduced the weight, life cycle costs and braking distance of a transit train with solutions like Metroplex, for which we secured a key order in Singapore. 
And finally, we are improving air quality and site transit cars with the launch of Blue future and advanced air filtration system. And as we highlighted last quarter, our order pipeline continues to strengthen, and we started to see that pipeline convert in the fourth quarter. 
Book-to-bill at the end of the quarter was 0.99 versus 0.89 in the third quarter. And we will continue to have positive momentum throughout 2021. Global freight volumes and equipment utilization have sequentially improved since the trough in the second quarter, and we are continuing to see uneven yet continued sequential recovery. 
This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic international locomotive order. And throughout the year, built on our strong installed base, closing several long-term service agreements. 
We have also expanded our global technology footprint in key regions, like Americas, Russia, CIS and India. 
Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec in the market. 
Quarter-to-date, we closed a significant multiyear order for modernizations and long-term service agreements. And we're well positioned for MoDs growth, overhauls and parts demand, especially as railroads recover. 
Based on these factors and orders, Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth, and continue to perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees in the short and long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. Pat?"

Our execution through a very challenging year demonstrated our ability to move quickly to reduce costs, generate strong cash flow, strengthen our financial position allocate capital and position Wabtec for long-term profitable growth. 
Now turning to Slide 4. I'll review the fourth quarter in more detail. 
Sales continued to recover sequentially in both freight and transit, up 9% from the third quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 15% decrease versus the prior year, driven mainly from the disruption across our freight and transit segments caused by the pandemic. 
For the quarter, operating income was $161 million, and adjusted operating income was $283 million, which was down 22% year-over-year. 
Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $122 million, of which $71 million was for noncash amortization and $51 million of costs related to onetime it synergy related expenses, along with restructuring due to on 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our U.K. operations. Adjusted operating margin was lower than the fourth quarter last year, mainly driven by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities stemming from roughly 40% fewer locomotive deliveries as well as sales mix impacted from lower parts and higher level of transit sales. 
During the fourth quarter, we took additional and aggressive operational and structural cost actions that will continue to drive margin improvement sequentially through 2021. Now looking forward, we expect a seasonal first quarter with some volume impacts, as you have heard our customers describe. That said, for the full year, we expect sequential improvement to result in a higher adjusted operating margin and profitable growth across both our freight and transit segments. 
At December 31, our multiyear backlog was $21.6 billion, up about $200 million quarter-over-quarter, our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, was $5.5 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A expense declined 22% year-over-year to $205 million. This was the result of swift cost actions during the downturn and excludes $30 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. 
SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. 
Amortization expenses were $71 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $280 million and depreciation expense of about $180 million. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% we expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate of about 26%. 
In the fourth quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.98. 
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 20% from last year to $1.3 billion but were up 8% sequentially from the third quarter as freight end markets continue to recover globally. 
In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up sequentially from the third quarter but down 32% year-over-year, mainly due to timing of locomotive deliveries, which we have discussed can often vary quarter-to-quarter. 
In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved 7% sequentially, but were down slightly versus the same period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued high locomotive parkings as well as the timing of overhauls. 
We expect our services sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes, unparking of locomotives and higher demand for Mods. Digital electronics sales were down 22% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption. Yet we closed the fourth quarter with strong order momentum and continue to see significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers focus on safety and improve productivity. 
Component sales were down 22% year-over-year. This is compared to a 58% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business, since the third quarter, we have seen signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. 
Freight segment adjusted operating income was $218 million an adjusted margin of 16.3%. 
The benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix in services and digital electronics as well as under absorption of costs. 
As always, we will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs as part of our lean efforts. 
Finally, segment backlog was $17.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased at 2% year-over-year to $684 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. 
OE sales were up 2% year-over-year demonstrating continued investments in green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were down 6% from last year. 
However, we remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve transit ridership and services increase globally. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which was up 40% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 11.3%. 
Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost, improve project execution and risk management, as noted by our strong operating performance. We are pleased with the momentum underway, and we'll continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. 
Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion, which was up about 5% versus last quarter. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a year of significant challenges, we generated $784 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. 
Cash flow was driven by conversion of net income and good working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. 
Of note, we had about $220 million of onetime impacts on cash flow during the year, mainly due to prior restructuring transaction and litigation charges. 
Restructuring costs in 2021 will result in further structural cost reductions, but we expect the overall level of onetime impacts to be less for the full year, total CapEx was $136 million. 
In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on our strategic plans and capital allocation priorities. 
Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduce debt by about $190 million, bringing our total debt down by $723 million since the merger with GE transportation. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made our first payment to GE of $115 million per our Tax Matters agreement. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and our liquidity is at a robust $1.9 billion. 
Over the course of the year, we returned $300 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. And as we announced this morning, our Board approved a renewal on our share buyback authorization for up to $500 million. 
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael."

Let's look at some of the segment dynamics setting to 2021. Starting with rate by product line. 
North America freight has mostly gone through a reset our services business has recovered, and we're working through the trough in our OE business. Due to locomotive deliveries are expected in North America in 2021. 
Total locomotive deliveries will be down roughly 35% year-over-year, driven mainly by North American locomotive deliveries, down by more than 100 units versus 2020. And this volume headwinds will create margin pressure due to under absorption at our manufacturing facilities. 
Our international pipeline remains strong and order momentum continues to build. In mining, we are optimistic as conditions are continuing to improve. When it comes to North America railcar built, railcars are coming back into use. 
Roughly 24% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage, which is similar to a pre co bid level. [indiscernible] are taking continued steps to slow down production and forecast estimates that railcar build for this year to be around 25,000 cars.
In the freight services, we are seeing year-over-year pressure on parts due to higher levels of parking. Demand for reliability and productivity will improve as railroads continue to recover, which, as I shared earlier, put us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls and parts demand. 
In digital electronics, we're focused on growing PTC internationally. In 2021, we have contracts to install over 3,000 horsepower per ton upgrades to our trip Optimizer systems a new record. 
While we anticipate North American CapEx budgets to remain constrained, the long-term outlook is strong. Now transitioning to Transit, we expect growth on both OE and aftermarket as ridership recovers from historic wells. 
Infrastructure spending, we'll continue in line with green initiatives as governments continue to churn to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient means of transport. And I'll expand on that in just a minute. 
For 2021, we expect revenues in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30, and cash conversion is expected to be greater than 90% for the full year. 
Across our segments, recovery is underway and will continue as customers experience volume growth and reinvest in their operations. We are seeing it already in some areas, and we expect sequential improvement in both aftermarket, services and international locomotives. 
In 2021, we expect orders to exceed anticipated sales, putting Wabtec in an even stronger position to drive profitable growth. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the importance of sustainability in the strategic direction we're driving as a company. 
At Wabtec, we are determined to have a lasting impact on our industry and the world. Last year, we launched the company's first sustainability report and provided a detailed look at how we're building a more sustainable future by strengthening our corporate governance framework, which guides how we operate, how we innovate and how we drive growth. We also laid out our strategy on how we're taking on some of the world's toughest challenges, including climate change and automation by creating cleaner more fuel filion solutions like the Flex drive locomotive. 
As noted earlier, this is the world's first battery electric locomotive and is currently being tested in revenue service by BNSF in California. 
So far, we're seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30%, with significant interest from customers in North America and internationally. 
We're also reducing our own carbon footprint, driving down energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities. And when it comes to our employees, we're building a company culture grounded in meritocracy and integrity, one that embraces diversity in all forms and invest in its people and communities. 
To deliver on this vision, we outlined specific targets for how we plan to drive measurable impact. Our 30x30 strategy sets the fine metrics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more by at least 30% by 2030, making our commitment clear to both our customers and our shareholders. 
We are making good advancement on these efforts, as you can see here and throughout our report. As we continue to build an even stronger wap back, we will be a driving force in transitioning the industry to a more sustainable future. 
And with that, let's turn to Slide 10. As you've heard this morning, our strategic plan has empowered us to innovate and has given us a clear framework to execute on our commitments to generate strong cash flow and to drive continued shareholder value. And it will continue to guide us as we expand our international installed base as we accelerate growth in digital electronics and services while further transforming our transit business. 
We are 2 years into our integration we have delivered on our synergies. We have delivered on increased shareholder value, and we've positioned Wabtec and our customers for competitive advantage. Heading into 2021, and we will drive margin expansion through prioritize cost actions and continue to invest in growth, creating new technologies that strengthen our leadership position on decarbonization and automation with the same determination and focus that has brought us here today. 
Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to once again personally thank every member of the Wabtec team for what they have delivered in 2020 and and the work they will continue to deliver in 2021. Thank you.

We have taken the necessary cost actions in the fourth quarter with significant headcount reductions, and we will continue to drive profitable growth as we go into '21. 
Mix was also a headwind, and that was a function just of some of the elements. If you look at by product line, you think about transit aftermarket was actually declined versus a year ago with OE growing and you have some other dynamics with both equipment coming down with a significant step down in locomotive shipments. 
In the quarter, and you also had a significant drop in the digital electronics revenues."

But I think if you look at the full year, the full WabTech view, we expect to be in that -- with the guidance to be in the above 15% kind of range which is flattish and improving into -- from '20 into '21. 
We're committed to the margin improvement on the transit side, like we've talked about in the strategic goals put out there. And we see the freight margins to improve as we continue to get our synergies that we've talked about as we benefit from the cost actions both in the full year and in the fourth quarter on the freight businesses and seeing the mix of business really heading in our favor."

I think we are a unique inflection point here to help shape what I'll call a clean energy economy focused around rail.

We're actively working with this administration in that regard. And with regards to I think just how we see things progressing throughout the year, I think similar to what you've heard from customers, I think you'll see sequential improvement.

Certainly, weather has impacted our operations in Fort Worth, and that's something that we're actively working very closely with our teams there to assess that impact.

Before we dive into the presentation, I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for their resilience and strong performance in 2020.  
In a year challenged by the pandemic, they work tirelessly, day in and day out, to protect each other and to operations delivering for our customers. They remain disciplined on cost management, executed in the face of many challenges and help to strengthen our financial position and ultimately deliver results for our shareholders.  
I'm proud of our team and the performance we've delivered, as you can see on Slide 3. Total sales for the year were $7.6 billion. This was driven largely by international freight market services and recovering in transit. But offset by global disruption due to the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies. In 2020, we exceeded expectations by delivering a 200 basis point margin improvement in Transit, where our team continues to drive improved project execution, productivity and cost actions.  
Total cash conversion was strong, with cash flow from operations of $784 million, which included roughly $220 million in onetime impacts related to transaction, restructuring and litigation expenses. Cash generation was driven in part by good working capital management, this allowed us to deliver on our financial priorities of investing in the business, paying down more than $300 million in debt, which includes the tax obligation to general electric and returning roughly $300 million of capital to shareholders.
Total multiyear backlog was over $21 billion, and up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $379 million our teams continue to take action to manage what's in our control, protect the long-term growth of the company and improve competitiveness while delivering shareholder value. In terms of synergies, we've delivered over $150 million in net synergies during 2020, and we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies in 2021.  
To achieve these goals, we are taking further actions on structural costs. In 2020, we reduced headcount by 12%. We drove a 10% reduction across our operational footprint, and we have started a lean reset across the company to remove waste maximize competitiveness across our product lines and advance our culture of continuous improvement.  
Since the GE Transportation merger, total rooftops have been reduced by more than 30% and total headcount by 16%. And to date, we have exited more than 90% of the GE shared services ahead of schedule. Throughout the year, we also never lost sight of investing in growth. We extended our leadership position in autonomous operations, helping more than 70 customers successfully meet the deadline for positive train control.  
We also closed a strategic digital order for Trip Optimizer, 0 to 0. This is an advance technology that allows the customer to start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop the train automatically using various controls that are integrated with positive train control. In 2020, we also further strengthened our role as leaders in decarbonizing global rail transportation by developing new technologies that reduce emissions and drive fuel efficiency.
We've built, shipped and tested the world's first savvy hall battery electric locomotive. We're proud to share this locomotives currently in revenue, operating service with BNS South in California, and it will be a game changer in decarbonizing rail.  
In 2020, we extended battery technology to passengers as well by closing a significant deal with New York City transit to drive down their overall carbon footprint.  
We have also reduced the weight, life cycle costs and braking distance of a transit train with solutions like Metroplex, for which we secured a key order in Singapore. And finally, we are improving air quality and site transit cars with the launch of Blue future and advanced air filtration system. And as we highlighted last quarter, our order pipeline continues to strengthen, and we started to see that pipeline convert in the fourth quarter.  
Book-to-bill at the end of the quarter was 0.99 versus 0.89 in the third quarter. And we will continue to have positive momentum throughout 2021. Global freight volumes and equipment utilization have sequentially improved since the trough in the second quarter, and we are continuing to see uneven yet continued sequential recovery.  
This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic international locomotive order. And throughout the year, built on our strong installed base, closing several long-term service agreements. We have also expanded our global technology footprint in key regions, like Americas, Russia, CIS and India. Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec in the market. Quarter-to-date, we closed a significant multiyear order for modernizations and long-term service agreements. And we're well positioned for mass growth, overhauls and parts demand, especially as railroads recover.  
Based on these factors and orders, Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth and continue to perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees in the short and long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. Pat?"

Our execution through a very challenging year demonstrated our ability to move quickly to reduce costs, generate strong cash flow, strengthen our financial position allocate capital and position Wabtec for long-term profitable growth. 
Now turning to Slide 4. I'll review the fourth quarter in more detail. Sales continued to recover sequentially in both Freight and Transit, up 9% from the third quarter. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 15% decrease versus the prior year, driven mainly from the disruption across our Freight and Transit segments caused by the pandemic. 
For the quarter, operating income was $161 million, and adjusted operating income was $283 million, which was down 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $122 million, of which $71 million was for noncash amortization and $51 million of costs related to onetime IT-synergy-related expenses, along with restructuring due to 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our U.K. operations. Adjusted operating margin was lower than the fourth quarter last year, mainly driven by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities stemming from roughly 40% fewer locomotive deliveries as well as sales mix impacted from lower parts and higher level of transit sales. 
During the fourth quarter, we took additional and aggressive operational and structural cost actions that will continue to drive margin improvement sequentially through 2021. Now looking forward, we expect a seasonal first quarter with some volume impacts, as you have heard our customers describe. That said, for the full year, we expect sequential improvement to result in a higher adjusted operating margin and profitable growth across both our Freight and Transit segments. 
At December 31, our multiyear backlog was $21.6 billion, up about $200 million quarter-over-quarter, our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, was $5.5 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. 
Looking at some of the detailed line items for the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A expense declined 22% year-over-year to $205 million. This was the result of swift cost actions during the downturn and excludes $30 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $71 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $280 million and depreciation expense of about $180 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% we expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate of about 26%. In the fourth quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.98. 
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased 20% from last year to $1.3 billion but were up 8% sequentially from the third quarter as Freight end markets continued to recover globally. 
In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up sequentially from the third quarter but down 32% year-over-year, mainly due to timing of locomotive deliveries, which we have discussed, can often vary quarter-to-quarter. In line with improving Freight traffic, our services sales improved 7% sequentially, but were down slightly versus the same period last year. This was largely driven by lower parts sales due to continued high locomotive parkings as well as the timing of overhauls. 
We expect our services sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes, unparking of locomotives and higher demand for mods. Digital electronics sales were down 22% year-over-year, as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption. Yet we closed the fourth quarter with strong order momentum and continued to see significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers focus on safety and improve productivity.
Component sales were down 22% year-over-year. This is compared to a 58% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since the third quarter, we have seen signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $218 million for an adjusted margin of 16.3%. The benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix and services and digital electronics as well as under absorption of costs. As always, we will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs as part of our lean efforts. 
Finally, segment backlog was $17.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased to 2% year-over-year to $684 million, driven largely by disruptions stemming from COVID-19. OE sales were up 2% year-over-year demonstrating continued investments in green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were down 6% from last year. However, we remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit ridership and services increase globally. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which was up 40% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 11.3%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost, improve project execution and risk management, as noted by our strong operating performance. We are pleased with the momentum underway, and we'll continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the segment. 
Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion, which was up about 5% versus last quarter. Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a year of significant challenges, we generated $784 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Cash flow was driven by conversion of net income and good working capital management, including improved inventory levels and higher customer deposits. 
Of note, we had about $220 million of onetime impacts on cash flow during the year, mainly due to prior restructuring, transaction and litigation charges. 
Restructuring costs in 2021 will result in further structural cost reductions, but we expect the overall level of onetime impacts to be less in 2021. For the full year, total CapEx was $136 million. In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on our strategic plans and capital allocation priorities. Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduce debt by about $190 million, bringing our total debt down by $723 million since the merger with GE transportation. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made our first payment to GE of $115 million per our tax matters agreement. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and our liquidity is at a robust $1.9 billion. 
Over the course of the year, we returned $300 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. And as we announced this morning, our Board approved a renewal on our share buyback authorization for up to $500 million. 
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael."

Let's look at some of the segment dynamics setting to 2021. Starting with rate by product line. 
North America freight has mostly gone through a reset our services business has recovered, and we're working through the trough in our OE business, due to locomotive deliveries are expected in North America in 2021. Total locomotive deliveries will be down roughly 35% year-over-year, driven mainly by North American locomotive deliveries, down by more than 100 units versus 2020. This volume headwinds will create margin pressure due to under absorption at our manufacturing facilities. Our international pipeline remains strong and order momentum continues to build. 
In mining, we are optimistic as conditions are continuing to improve. When it comes to North America railcar built, railcars are coming back into use. Roughly 24% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage, which is similar to a pre-COVID level. Dealers are taking continued steps to slow down production and forecast the estimates that railcar build for this year to be around 25,000 cars.
In the Freight services, we are seeing year-over-year pressure on parts due to higher levels of parking. Demand for reliability and productivity will improve as railroads continue to recover, which, as I shared earlier, put us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls and parts demand. 
In digital electronics, we're focused on growing PTC internationally. In 2021, we have contracts to install over 3,000 horsepower per ton upgrades to our Trip Optimizer systems, a new record. While we anticipate North American CapEx budgets to remain constrained, the long-term outlook is strong. Now transitioning to Transit. We expect growth on both OE and aftermarket as ridership recovers from historic levels. Infrastructure spending will continue in line with green initiatives as governments continue to churn to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient means of transport. And I'll expand on that in just a minute. 
For 2021, we expect revenues in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30, and cash conversion is expected to be greater than 90% for the full year. Across our segments, recovery is underway and will continue as customers experience volume growth and reinvest in their operations. We are seeing it already in some areas, and we expect sequential improvement in both aftermarket, services and international locomotives.
In 2021, we expect orders to exceed anticipated sales, putting Wabtec in an even stronger position to drive profitable growth. With that, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the importance of sustainability in the strategic direction we're driving as a company.
At Wabtec, we are determined to have a lasting impact on our industry and the world. Last year, we launched the company's first sustainability report and provided a detailed look at how we're building a more sustainable future by strengthening our corporate governance framework, which guides how we operate, how we innovate and how we drive growth. We also laid out our strategy on how we're taking on some of the world's toughest challenges, including climate change and automation by creating cleaner more fuel efficient solutions, like the Flex drive locomotive. 
As noted earlier, this is the world's first battery electric locomotive and is currently being tested in revenue service by BNSF in California. So far, we're seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30%, with significant interest from customers in North America and internationally.
We're also reducing our own carbon footprint, driving down energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities. And when it comes to our employees, we're building a company culture grounded in meritocracy and integrity, one that embraces diversity in all forms and invest in its people and communities.
To deliver on this vision, we outlined specific targets for how we plan to drive measurable impact. Our 30x30 strategy sets the fine metrics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more by at least 30% by 2030, making our commitment clear to both our customers and our shareholders. We are making good advancement on these efforts, as you can see here and throughout our report. As we continue to build an even stronger Wabtec, we will be a driving force in transitioning the industry to a more sustainable future. 
And with that, let's turn to Slide 10. As you've heard this morning, our strategic plan has empowered us to innovate and has given us a clear framework to execute on our commitments, to generate strong cash flow and to drive continued shareholder value. And it will continue to guide us as we expand our international installed base as we accelerate growth in digital electronics and services, while further transforming our transit business. 
We are 2 years into our integration. We have delivered on our synergies. We have delivered on increased shareholder value. And we've positioned Wabtec and our customers for competitive advantage. Heading into 2021, and we will drive margin expansion through prioritized cost actions and continue to invest in growth, creating new technologies that strengthen our leadership position on decarbonization and automation with the same determination and focus that has brought us here today. 
Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to once again personally thank every member of the Wabtec team for what they have delivered in 2020 and the work they will continue to deliver in 2021. Thank you. 
And with that, Kristine?"

We appreciate you joining us today.
Turning to slide 3. We continue to see a recovery across the global freight and transit rail markets, with North American freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improving in the first quarter and investments in transit infrastructure continuing. These directional trends, along with the focused performance of our team and execution against our strategic plan are reflected in our first quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion. This was largely driven by international freight markets, services and are recovery in transit, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by lean initiatives, cost actions and favorable mix from mining and lodes.
Cash conversion was strong with cash flow from operations of $292 million, cash generation was due in large part to good working capital management, allowing us to deliver on our financial priorities, including strategic acquisition of Nordco, which I'll touch up on more in a moment.
Total multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. Overall, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.89, a strong reinforcement that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can, deliver long-term growth of the company and increased shareholder value.
In the area of synergies, we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies this year, and we have positioned the company for long-term profitable growth. In the first quarter, we exited all shared service agreements steaming from the GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule. This was a tremendous execution by the team on a complex transaction. In addition, we continue to take aggressive actions on structural cost. This includes reducing total operational square footage by 5% since January of last year, and we will further reduce our square footage by an additional 2% for the remainder of 2021.
Moving forward, we'll continue to drive additional cost reductions through lean initiatives and balance our focus on execution with strategic investments in high-return opportunities that drive long-term profitable growth. You saw that with our recent acquisition of Nordco, which is a leader in the maintenance of waste space, with 60% of its revenues coming from aftermarket services and a significant installed base of over 5,000 units. We really like this business, and it's leading edge technologies. It opens up significant opportunities to expand domestically and internationally in the growing maintenance waste segment while driving long-term profitable growth. Integration activities are already underway, and we expect this strategic acquisition to be accretive to earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital in 2021. On the commercial front, we're also focused on driving growth and won some key orders in the quarter despite a challenging environment. This included a significant deal for our FPL Advantage product, which is a fuel upgrade cash. As we have shared before, there are more than 10,000 FPL locomotives running globally. With this NexGen technology, we're opening up a multimillion-dollar pipeline of opportunity that is helping customers drive down fuel consumption by up to 5% as well as drive down emissions. That means for single locomotive burning 250,000 gallons of fuel, it can translate into a $25,000 in savings per year. Also, when it comes to technology differentiation, and sustainable transportation, we completed a significant operational milestone with our flex drive battery electric locomotive, testing it in revenue services with BNSF across more than 13,000 miles of track. Through this demonstration, the flag strive was able to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions by more than 11%, a game changer in decarbonizing rail. We continue to see growing interest in this NexGen technology from customers in both North America and internationally, and we expect our battery electric locomotive to become an important area of growth for the company over the long term. In digital and electronics, we're also leading the way in rail, safety and utilization. We closed the key order for positive train control internationally, and we are encouraged by the strong order pipeline for international PTC expansion. Finally, we had a solid quarter in transit, winning new brakes, doors, and HVAC contracts in India, Taiwan and France, including a significant order for platform doors and gates at over 30 train stations in Marcel.
Overall, our order pipeline continues to strengthen, driven by multiyear orders in freight services, equipment and digital electronics. Based on this factor and orders, Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth and perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position."

We had a solid operational start to the year, despite the challenges in our North America OE end markets and ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, generate cash flow invest for the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll review the first quarter in more detail. Sales for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, which reflects a 5% decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower North America OE freight markets as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic. For the quarter, operating income was $192 million, and adjusted operating income was $277 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $85 million of which $70 million was for noncash amortization and $16 million of restructuring and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco, along with restructuring due to the 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our U.K. operations. Adjusted operating margin was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter last year, but up 110 basis points from the fourth quarter versus last year, adjusted operating margin was impacted by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities, stemming from fewer locomotive deliveries as well as sales mix impacted from lower digital electronics and a higher level of transit sales. At March 31, our multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year was $5.7 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the first quarter, adjusted SG&A declined 2% year-over-year to $224 million. This was the result of cost actions during the downturn and excludes $11 million of restructuring and transaction expenses.
SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be up about 5% versus 2020, driven by the normalization of costs following the COVID disruption. That said, we will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. This was largely due to the lower locomotive volume outlook for the year as well as some changes in project timing. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales. Amortization expense were $70 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $285 million and depreciation expense of about $195 million.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.5%, which was higher than year-over-year due to certain discrete items during the quarter. We expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate to be about 26%. And the first quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.59 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.89.
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 9% from last year to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by North America OE end markets but partially offset by strong services and aftermarket growth. In terms of our product lines, equipment sales were down 36% year-over-year, mainly due to zero deliveries in North America, which resulted in roughly 50% fewer locomotive deliveries versus last year, a dynamic that unfortunately persists. However, mining was a bright spot with units and revenues up double digits during the quarter. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved a solid 13% versus last year and was up 3% sequentially. This was largely driven by strong modernization deliveries, and higher aftermarket sales from un-parking of locomotives due to the extreme weather in the quarter. I'd note that the timing of mod deliveries vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our services sales to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes. Digital electronics sales were down 10% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to the COVID disruption. Yet, we had another quarter of strong momentum for multiyear orders and continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers focus on safety and improved productivity. Component sales were down 8% year-over-year. This is compared to a 45% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our components business. We continue to see signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $214 million for an adjusted margin of 18.1% versus last year, the benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix as well as under absorption due to lower locomotive deliveries. We will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs to drive margin improvement. Finally, freight segment backlog was $18 billion, up from the prior quarter on broad multiyear order momentum across the segment.
Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 3% year-over-year to $647 million, driven largely by steady aftermarket sales and favorable foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. OE sales were roughly flat year-over-year, demonstrating continued investments and green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were up about 5% from last year. We expect aftermarket sales to continue to improve as transit ridership and services increase globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $79 million, which was up 6% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 12.2%. Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost, and improved project execution, demonstrated by our good operating performance despite a challenging environment due to the pandemic. We are pleased with the momentum underway, and the teams are committed to execute on more actions to drive 100 basis points of margin improvement for this segment in 2021. Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion.
Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a seasonally challenging quarter, we generated $292 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency and quality of our business portfolio. Cash flow was driven largely by good conversion of net income and focused working capital management, including a $93 million incremental benefit from accounts receivable securitization, which provides attractive financing and provide liquidity. During the quarter, total CapEx was $27 million. 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of our expected sales. Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on strategic plans and capital allocation priorities, including the strategic acquisition of Nordco, which will drive profitable growth for Wabtec. Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.7x, and our liquidity is robust at $1.7 billion. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rafael."

Turning to Slide 8. Let's look at some of the market dynamics by segment. Overall, we're seeing a gradual recovery across most end markets as global economic activity improves.

Overall, we're seeing a gradual recovery across most end markets as global economic activity improves. And we're continuing to monitor the evolving COVID situation in regions like India. This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. While we continue to work through the trough in the OE North American market, where new local orders remain stagnant, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in freight volumes and a broad recovery across agriculture, intermodal, in the industrial markets. Locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in 2020, are improving as a result of increased freight traffic and demand is stemming from weather disruptions during the quarter. We expect demand for reliability and productivity to improve as railroads continue to recover. This will put us in a position of strength across our freight portfolio. When it comes to North America railcar built, railcars are coming back into use, more than 20% on of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, but it's back to pre-COVID levels. Industry orders for new railcars remain weak. And forecast, estimate the railcar build this year to be below 30,000 cars. We have a strong order pipeline internationally, and we expect long-term revenue growth in several of these markets going forward. And in mining, market conditions are also improving. Transitioning to the transit sector, rider shift is uneven, but recovering as economies open up. We are watching short-term dynamics as the pandemic evolves in several geographies, including India and Europe. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong in infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a focus, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.
Turning to guidance for the year. We are updating our sales guidance to $7.7 to $7.9 billion and updating adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.3. This largely reflects upside from the acquisition of Nordco, our operational execution to date and visibility to backlog. Consistent with our initial forecast for 2021, with more growth weighted to the second half of the year we expect second quarter earnings only slightly higher than the first quarter. This is in line with the positive and gradual trends in our freight markets. That said, we are seeing disruption from the resurgence of COVID, especially in a key region for us like India, and we will continue to take swift and necessary action as conditions evolve. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year as well as margin expansion to prioritize cost actions.
Turning to Slide 9 and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the first quarter despite a challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of the company and remain committed to executing on our strategic plan. This includes reducing costs and executing on synergies, driving margin expansion across our freight and transit segments generating strong cash flow and delivering long-term profitable growth. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and to improve the world and our teams globally leave up to this mission every day after demonstrating a strong performance in 2020 and in the first quarter of '21, I'm confident that this company will drive profitable long-term growth and be a leader in transitioning our customers and the industry to a more sustainable future.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion."

But momentum is good. We see that with the book-to-bill. And quarter-to-date, we've also had, I think, good momentum to continue on that trend, that's kind of that."

We appreciate you joining us today.
Turning to slide 3. We continue to see a recovery across the global freight and transit rail markets, with North American freight volumes and equipment utilization sequentially improving in the first quarter and investments in transit infrastructure continuing. 
These directional trends, along with the focused performance of our team and execution against our strategic plan are reflected in our first quarter results. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion. 
This was largely driven by international freight markets, services and our recovery in transit, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. 
Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, driven by lean initiatives, cost actions and favorable mix from mining and mods.
Cash conversion was strong with cash flow from operations of $292 million, cash generation was due in large part to good working capital management, allowing us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the strategic acquisition of Nordco, which I'll touch up on more in a moment.
Total multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up sequentially over the prior quarter, providing us better visibility into 2021 and beyond. 
Overall, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.89, a strong reinforcement that our teams are continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can, deliver long-term growth of the company and increased shareholder value.
In the area of synergies, we're on track to deliver the full run rate of $250 million in synergies this year, and we have positioned the company for long-term profitable growth. 
In the first quarter, we exited all shared service agreements stemming from the GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule. This was a tremendous execution by the team on a complex transaction.  In addition, we continue to take aggressive actions on structural cost. 
This includes reducing total operational square footage by 5% since January of last year, and we will further reduce our square footage by an additional 2% for the remainder of 2021.
Moving forward, we'll continue to drive additional cost reductions through lean initiatives and balance our focus on execution with strategic investments in high-return opportunities that drive long-term profitable growth. 
You saw that with our recent acquisition of Nordco, which is a leader in the maintenance of waste space, with 60% of its revenues coming from aftermarket services and a significant installed base of over 5,000 units. 
We really like this business, and it's leading edge technologies. It opens up significant opportunities to expand domestically and internationally in the growing maintenance waste segment while driving long-term profitable growth. Integration activities are already underway, and we expect this strategic acquisition to be accretive to earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital in 2021. 
On the commercial front, we're also focused on driving growth and won some key orders in the quarter despite a challenging environment. This included a significant deal for our FDL Advantage product, which is a fuel upgrade cash. 
As we have shared before, there are more than 10,000 FDL locomotives running globally. With this next-gen technology, we're opening up a multimillion-dollar pipeline of opportunity that is helping customers drive down fuel consumption by up to 5% as well as drive down emissions. 
That means for a single locomotive burning 250,000 gallons of fuel, it can translate into a $25,000 in savings per year. 
Also, when it comes to technology differentiation, and sustainable transportation, we completed a significant operational milestone with our flex drive battery electric locomotive, testing it in revenue services with BNSF across more than 13,000 miles of track. 
Through this demonstration, the flex drive was able to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions by more than 11%, a game changer in decarbonizing rail. 
We continue to see growing interest in this next-gen technology from customers in both North America and internationally, and we expect our battery electric locomotive to become an important area of growth for the company over the long term. 
In digital and electronics, we're also leading the way in rail, safety and utilization. We closed the key order for positive train control internationally, and we are encouraged by the strong order pipeline for international PTC expansion. 
Finally, we had a solid quarter in transit, winning new brakes, doors, and HVAC contracts in India, Taiwan and France, including a significant order for platform doors and gates at over 30 train stations in Marcel.
Overall, our order pipeline continues to strengthen, driven by multiyear orders in freight services, equipment and digital electronics. 
Based on this factor and orders, Wabtec is in a strong position to drive profitable growth and perform for our shareholders, for our customers and for our employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position."

We had a solid operational start to the year, despite the challenges in our North America OEM markets and ongoing disruption from the pandemic. 
We demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, generate cash flow invest for the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll review the first quarter in more detail. Sales for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, which reflects a 5% decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower North America OE freight markets as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic. 
For the quarter, operating income was $192 million, and adjusted operating income was $277 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. 
Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $85 million of which $70 million was for noncash amortization and $16 million of restructuring and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco, along with restructuring due to the 2021 locomotive volumes and restructuring in our U.K. operations. 
Adjusted operating margin was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter last year, but up 110 basis points from the fourth quarter versus last year, adjusted operating margin was impacted by under absorption costs at our manufacturing facilities, stemming from fewer locomotive deliveries as well as sales mix impacted from lower digital electronics and a higher level of transit sales. At March 31, our multiyear backlog was $21.7 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year was $5.7 billion and continues to provide good visibility into the year. 
Looking at some of the detailed line items for the first quarter, adjusted SG&A declined 2% year-over-year to $224 million. This was the result of cost actions during the downturn and excludes $11 million of restructuring and transaction expenses.
SG&A expense benefited from headcount reductions and the realization of synergies. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be up about 5% versus 2020, driven by the normalization of costs following the COVID disruption. 
That said, we will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs. Engineering expenses decreased from last year. 
This was largely due to the lower locomotive volume outlook for the year as well as some changes in project timing. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales. 
Amortization expense were $70 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $285 million and depreciation expense of about $195 million.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.5%, which was higher than year-over-year due to certain discrete items during the quarter. We expect a full year 2021 effective tax rate to be about 26%. And the first quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.59 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.89.
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the freight segment, total sales decreased 9% from last year to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by North America OEM markets but partially offset by strong services and aftermarket growth. 
In terms of our product lines, equipment sales were down 36% year-over-year, mainly due to zero deliveries in North America, which resulted in roughly 50% fewer locomotive deliveries versus last year, a dynamic that unfortunately persists. 
However, mining was a bright spot with units and revenues up double digits during the quarter. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved a solid 13% versus last year and was up 3% sequentially. 
This was largely driven by strong modernization deliveries, and higher aftermarket sales from un-parking of locomotives due to the extreme weather in the quarter. 
I'd note that the timing of mod deliveries vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our services sales to improve with the gradual recovery in freight volumes. Digital electronics sales were down 10% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to the COVID disruption. 
Yet, we had another quarter of strong momentum for multiyear orders and continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers focus on safety and improved productivity. 
Component sales were down 8% year-over-year. This is compared to a 45% lower railcar build year-over-year, demonstrating the diversification within our Components business. We continue to see signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket components as more railcars come out of storage. 
Freight segment adjusted operating income was $214 million for an adjusted margin of 18.1% versus last year, the benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix as well as under absorption due to lower locomotive deliveries. 
We will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve costs to drive margin improvement. Finally, Freight segment backlog was $18 billion, up from the prior quarter on broad multiyear order momentum across the segment.
Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 3% year-over-year to $647 million, driven largely by steady aftermarket sales and favorable foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
OE sales were roughly flat year-over-year, demonstrating continued investments and green infrastructure. Aftermarket sales were up about 5% from last year. 
We expect aftermarket sales to continue to improve as transit ridership and services increase globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $79 million, which was up 6% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 12.2%. 
Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost, and improved project execution, demonstrated by our good operating performance despite a challenging environment due to the pandemic. 
We are pleased with the momentum underway, and the teams are committed to execute on more actions to drive 100 basis points of margin improvement for this segment in 2021. Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.7 billion.
Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Despite a seasonally challenging quarter, we generated $292 million of operating cash flow, demonstrating the resiliency and quality of our business portfolio. 
Cash flow was driven largely by good conversion of net income and focused working capital management, including a $93 million incremental benefit from accounts receivable securitization, which provides attractive financing and provides liquidity. 
During the quarter, total CapEx was $27 million. 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $180 million or about 2% of our expected sales. 
Overall, our strong cash generation allowed us to execute on strategic plans and capital allocation priorities, including the strategic acquisition of Nordco, which will drive profitable growth for Wabtec. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.7x, and our liquidity is robust at $1.7 billion. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash flow generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital to grow shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rafael."

Overall, we're seeing a gradual recovery across most end markets as global economic activity improves. And we're continuing to monitor the evolving COVID situation in regions like India.  This aligns with what you've heard from our customers as well. 
While we continue to work through the trough in the OEM North American market, where new local orders remain stagnant, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in freight volumes and a broad recovery across agriculture, intermodal, in the industrial markets. Locomotive parkings, after peaking to a record high in 2020, are improving as a result of the increased freight traffic and demand is stemming from weather disruptions during the quarter. 
We expect demand for reliability and productivity to improve as railroads continue to recover. This will put us in a position of strength across our freight portfolio. When it comes to North America railcar built, railcars are coming back into use, more than 20% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, but it's back to pre-COVID levels. 
Industry orders for new railcars remain weak. And forecast, estimate the railcar build this year to be below 30,000 cars. We have a strong order pipeline internationally, and we expect long-term revenue growth in several of these markets going forward. And in mining, market conditions are also improving. Transitioning to the transit sector, rider shift is uneven, but recovering as economies open up. 
We are watching short-term dynamics as the pandemic evolves in several geographies, including India and Europe. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remains strong in infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a focus, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.
Turning to guidance for the year. We are updating our sales guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and updating adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.3. This largely reflects upside from the acquisition of Nordco, our operational execution to date and visibility to backlog. 
Consistent with our initial forecast for 2021, with more growth weighted to the second half of the year we expect second quarter earnings only slightly higher than the first quarter. 
This is in line with the positive and gradual trends in our freight markets. That said, we are seeing disruption from the resurgence of COVID, especially in a key region for us like India, and we will continue to take swift and necessary action as conditions evolve. Finally, we remain confident in delivering strong cash generation for the year as well as margin expansion to prioritize cost actions.
Turning to Slide 9 and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the first quarter despite a challenging environment. As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of the company and remain committed to executing on our strategic plan. 
This includes reducing costs and executing on synergies, driving margin expansion across our Freight and Transit segments generating strong cash flow and delivering long-term profitable growth. 
As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and to improve the world and our teams globally leave up to this mission every day. 
After demonstrating a strong performance in 2020 and in the first quarter of '21, I'm confident that this company will drive profitable long-term growth and be a leader in transitioning our customers and the industry to a more sustainable future.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion."

Now when you look at the units who are parked pre-COVID, those units, it's a smaller number that it can potentially be utilizing here. 
So I think the momentum is positive. We're going to continue to watch that closely here, especially as we go into the second half of the year. 
And we're especially pleased with the performance we are having with customers in terms of reliability and availability, which ultimately is really the differentiator for us to winning more share of wallet, so positive.

Could you maybe help us understand the progression of digital through the year to get to that flattish?

Our book-to-bill was strong in both fourth quarter of last year and first quarter this year. So that just provides back into what I just said. But customers, when you look at last year, they pushed out some of those investments due to COVID. 
With that being said, both efficiency, productivity and safety remain an imperative. We expect those multiyear orders to continue. The team is very focused on convertibility for the year at this 
point. 
So with the strong book-to-bill, we saw some of that impact beyond this year. So really a lot of focus on convertibility for this year. At this point, we're continuing to invest in the business. That business will continue to provide long-term growth for us. I think there's more an element here of delay. 
And keep in mind also the element of locomotive shipments. Whenever ship locomotives into North America, that goes with a significant number of, what I call, digital software and hardware. 
So -- and with that drop, we're not seeing that. So that's not an element of the impact that I just want to highlight."

Let's begin on Slide 4. We delivered a strong second quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up sequentially and year-over-year.Total sales",691,"Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. We delivered a strong second quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up sequentially and year-over-year.
Total sales for the quarter were $2 billion, driven by growing demand in Freight services, components and Transit but offset by weakness in the North America, OE and market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, driven by ongoing lean initiatives, cost actions and the realization of synergies.
Total cash flow from operations was $223 million. This takes the year-to-date cash operations to $515 million versus $229 million a year ago. It's a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance and focused working capital management. Cash conversion for the year is over 100%.
Our year-to-date book-to-bill continues to be a positive story. We ended the first half of the year greater than 1, and we have a strong order pipeline for international locomotives.
Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $21.5 billion, providing strong visibility into 2021 and beyond.
Finally, we ended second quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.06, up 22% year-over-year.
In the area of synergies, we are on track to achieve our full run rate of $250 million this year, and we are feeling the benefits of our footprint, consolidation and aggressive actions on structural cost.
So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. I am confident that with strong execution, focused cost measures, our teams drive on productivity and continued improvements in our end markets, we will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth.
Now let's turn into Slide 5, to discuss a few of our recent business highlights, starting with a strategic partnership we recently announced with CSX. CSX will be the first railroad to implement Wabtec's trip optimizer zero-to-zero solution, which will allow them to start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it automatically using various controls. Zero-to-zero builds on trip optimizers, proven performance and is an important building block to autonomous rail and a critical component of energy management, which Eric will cover shortly.
We're also partnering with them to revitalize their yard fleet through an innovative tier 4 switcher modernization program, where we overhaul switchers to the latest Wabtec Tier 4 platform. Additionally, we are working with them to modernize their locomotive fleet with our FDL Advantage engine upgrade, which delivers another 5% reduction in fuel consumption. Some great examples of partnership and innovation at work.
On the international front, commercial activity is increasing with multiyear orders in equipment, digital electronics and Transit. In the second quarter, we closed a significant order for positive train control with Ruma and we're now implementing PTC in 3 countries outside the U.S.
In addition, we won a key international locomotive deal in South America and a significant Transit contract with Natura in North America. Finally, when it comes to innovation and going after opportunities that can enhance our current portfolio, we announced a strategic partnership with General Motors, where we're exploring the use of battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies to accelerate the rail industry's path to zero-emission locomotives. This is an exciting space, one where strategic collaboration and investment will accelerate the path to more sustainable rail. Eric will share more on this in a moment.
It's because of this breakthrough advancements and a commitment to innovation that Wabtec was named to Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2021 in recognition of our commitment to solve some of the world's toughest challenges in the transportation sector. It's also because of our proven commitment to innovation that we were able to further strengthen our financial position in the second quarter with a successful EUR 500 million green bond offering to fund investments that will continue to advance sustainable rail.
Looking forward, we are confident, Wabtec will drive long-term profitable growth and lead the industry in advancing position in sustainable rail even further.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter and segment performance and our overall financial position."

We had solid operational and financial performance during the quarter. As markets continue to gradually recover, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, to generate strong cash flow and to invest in the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review the second quarter in more detail. Sales for the second quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 16% increase versus the prior year, driven by a broad-based recovery across our portfolio, offset somewhat by lower North America OE Freight markets.
For the quarter, operating income was $203 million, and adjusted operating income was $306 million, which was up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $103 million, of which $73 million was for noncash amortization and $30 million for restructuring, of which the majority was for our U.K. operations and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco. 
Adjusted operating margin was 10 basis points higher than the second quarter last year and up from the first quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin benefited from higher sales and the realization of synergies.
Now looking at some of the detailed line items for the second quarter, adjusted S&A was $254 million, which was 12.6% of sales. This was up from last year due to the normalization of certain expenses compared to the temporary cost actions taken during the depth of the pandemic a year ago.
Adjusted SG&A excludes $9 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be about 12% of sales. We will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs.
Engineering expense increased from last year. This was largely due to higher volume outlook for the year. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales.
Amortization expense was $73 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $290 million in depreciation expense of about $205 million.
Our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 25.3%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to be about 26.3%. For the full year, we still expect an effective tax rate of about 26%.
In the second quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.66, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.06.
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 7. Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 11% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by strong growth in services and aftermarket and higher demand for components.
In terms of product lines, Equipment sales were down 2% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries in North America. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved a solid 22% versus last year, and were up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by strong modernization deliveries, higher aftermarket sales from the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco.
I'd note the timing of mod deliveries vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our services sales to improve with the gradual recovery in Freight volumes.
Digital Electronics sales were down 2% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption, yet we had strong momentum with book-to-bill over 1 for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety and improve productivity.
Component sales were up 15% year-over-year, driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets. This is compared to a 19% lower railcar build year-over-year. Demonstrating the diversification within our components business, we are encouraged by railcars continuing to come out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and the broad recovery in industrial end markets.
Freight segment adjusted operating income was $247 million for an adjusted margin of 18.5%. Versus last year, the benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix as well as under-absorption due to lower locomotive deliveries.
We will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve cost to drive margin improvement.
Turning to Slide 8. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 27% year-over-year to $680 million, driven largely by recovery in OE projects and steady aftermarket sales. OE sales were up 41% year-over-year as the second quarter 2020 was severely impacted by disruptions stemming from the pandemic. OE sales were also up 12% sequentially, reflecting the continued momentum for investments in green infrastructure.
Aftermarket sales were up about 17% from last year. we expect aftermarket sales to improve for the full year as economies continue to open and demand for Transit services increased globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $73 million, which was up 43% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 10.8%, which is slightly down from the first quarter due to a charge for a discrete warranty adjustment of over $5 million. Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost and improve our project execution. We are committed to drive 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment in 2021.
Now turning to Slide 9. We wanted to provide a more detailed look at our 12-month and multiyear backlog. We had another solid performance with total orders for the year exceeding $4 billion resulting in a book-to-bill for the year above 1. Orders can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but we are encouraged to see a broad-based momentum across the portfolio.
Our Freight segment backlog remained strong at $17.8 billion with year-to-date book-to-bill above 1, driven by broad-based order activity across the portfolio. Our 12-month backlog of $4.1 billion is the highest since the third quarter of 2019, a result of improving end markets. We continue to see a robust pipeline of order opportunities, especially in international end markets.
Our Transit segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.7 billion, with a 12-month backlog of $1.7 billion. We did see some projects push to the right as a result of ongoing disruption due to the pandemic, yet our outlook remained strong as sustainable infrastructure spending increases globally.
And finally, at June 30, our multiyear backlog remained strong at $21.5 billion and continues to provide increasing forward visibility.
Let's turn to our financial position on Slide 10. We had another solid quarter of cash generation, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow during the quarter bringing year-to-date cash flow generated over $0.5 billion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio. Cash flow was driven largely by good conversion of net income and focused working capital management.
During the quarter, total CapEx was $29 million. In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $140 million. During the quarter, we successfully completed a EUR 500 million green bond offering and paid down nearly $200 million in debt during the quarter. As a result, our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.6x, and our liquidity is robust at about $1.7 billion.
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remained strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and grow shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael."

And shifting our focus to markets on Slide 11. We are continuing to see good signs of recovery. While the trough in the OE North America market remains, we are seeing sequential improvement in freight rail volumes. Total carloads were up 3% from first quarter and up 20% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong trends in intermodal along with a pickup in the industrial sector in areas like chemicals and metals.
Locomotive parkings continued to improve due to increased Freight rail traffic, and we expect demand for reliability and productivity to increase, putting our services business in a position of strength.
When it comes to North America railcar builds, railcars are coming back into use and about 22% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, but this is encouragingly below pre-Covid levels.
As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve, and we forecast the railcar build for this year to be about 30,000 cars. Internationally, our order pipeline remained strong, and we expect long-term revenue growth in several markets.
In mining, market conditions also continue to improve. Transitioning to the Transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets, but overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remained strong. Infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a focus, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.
Given this market backdrop, our strong performance in the first half and our confidence in our ability to deliver, we are raising our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We now expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.2 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.15 to $4.35. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90%, resulting in a strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year. So overall, positive signs of recovery, great execution by the team in the first half and a meaningful update to our full year view as we manage through the continued recovery.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Gebhardt."

I'm Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer for Wabtec and I'm thrilled to be here with you to share some of the transformative advancements we're driving in the clean energy transportation sector.
Turning to Slide 12. As you may be aware, today, rail represents the cleanest, most energy efficient and safest mode of moving freight and people on land, moving 40% of freight per tonne mile in the U.S. alone. Current trends indicate that freight and passenger activity will more than double by 2050 as the sector pushes for more sustainable transportation.
At Wabtec, we're innovating to help our customers increase efficiency, reduce costs and cut their overall carbon footprint through the development of low-emitting locomotive technologies, including Tier 4 locomotives running on renewable fuels and battery electric locomotives.
We're also pushing the boundaries into alternative fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and hydrogen, which I'll share more on in a moment.
Over the last year, we built and tested in revenue operation with BNSF Railway and the California Air Resources Board, the world's first heavy haul 100% battery electric locomotion called FLXdrive. This locomotive, which operated in a contest between 2 other locomotives had a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours and generated most of its energy from regenerative braking. At the conclusion of this rigorous 3-month test that span 13,000 miles, the FLXdrive exceeded expectations, delivering more than an 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of eliminating 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel and flashing 69 tons of CO2 emissions. And it's just the beginning. At more than 7-megawatt hours, which is the next version of the FLXdrive, we currently have in development and expect to bring to market in 2023. We anticipate further reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30%. This reduction is tied to a tightly coupled system that Wabtec is driving in the marketplace that includes batteries, trip optimizer, power electronics and even our braking systems to capture all the available regenerative braking energy. And by owning the complete system, we can control the consist to optimize fuel burn or emissions, battery life or speed depending on the operators' need on a specific route.
Our second-generation battery electric locomotive will operate independently and leverage General Motors opium battery technology, that Rafael mentioned earlier. It's a winning combination, where we bring our expertise in energy management and systems optimization for heavy haul locomotives, while taking full advantage of GM's advanced technologies and speed to market.
In addition to these efforts, we're also reimagining the future of rail utilization, safety and logistics optimization. Our vision is to expand the use of freight rail, enable the elimination of over 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually across the global transportation network, reduce road congestion in our cities and make transportation significantly safer for everyone.
Put us on this path, we've installed positive train control systems and software on more than 24,000 locomotives. This technology has revolutionized rail safety in the U.S. over the last decade and helped make the rail sector more efficient and effective. Our next-generation systems will take efficiency even further, by enabling moving block and virtual coupling instead of a traditional fixed block signaling use today, while still maintaining the most stringent safety standards.
Similarly, our trip optimizer solution or smart cruise control system, which is installed on over 11,000 locomotives has helped save customers more than 400 million gallons of fuel and 4.5 million tons of CO2. Together, with movement planner, these digital solutions are revolutionizing locomotive fuel efficiency and real-time network planning. They're also helping move goods more efficiently using the existing rail network, all while reducing energy use, emissions and waste.
Looking to the future on Slide 13, we will accelerate the shift to green energy solutions and bring to market a heavy haul zero-emission hydrogen hybrid locomotive. And we have a clear road map to get there, one that derisks across the path with batteries as a focal point across the entire spectrum and one that is already underway with FLXdrive. Our vision is to leverage battery technology while burning hydrogen in the internal combustion engine, similar to what we're doing today with natural gas in Florida. This step is a retrofittable approach, where we can take 80% to 90% of the energy content and make it hydrogen, driving a dramatic drop in emissions.
In parallel, we will develop a hydrogen fuel cell locomotive and ruggedize the fuel cells so they can operate in a harsh rail environment. GM's hydrogen capabilities give us an advantage here as well. Their hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell power cubes are compact and easy to package and can be used in a wide range of applications, including locomotives.
Our vision is clear, to have an operation fully decarbonized trains utilizing battery electric and hydrogen technology. The recent partnerships we announced with Carnegie Mellon University the nation's leading university in artificial intelligence and robotics and Genesee & Wyoming, the nation's largest short line and regional freight railroad put us on a path to do just that. By working together, we believe the transition to a more utilized, efficient and zero emission rail network is absolutely within reach, and we're committed to helping the industry get there. 
With that, Rafael, I'll turn it back over to you."

There's also elements of how underabsorption plays along the year. So as we look at it, there's an element of sometimes locomotive deliveries versus what the build plan is for the year.

The other element is the continued focus from customers down on really making sure that you're getting more productivity. And I think that will tie very well with some of the solutions that we have out there that dry fuel savings. We've talked about the FPL Advantage. There's also, I think, significant elements in terms of upgrades that we can continue to drive. You've heard about us implementing the Tier 4 engine with CSX now. This is something that we can apply not only to our platform but to other platforms out there as well. And we're really excited about the opportunity here on this energy transition with battery electric. We are currently responding to a number of really questions coming from request for quote and request for information from customers, not just in North America, around the world.

There is an element of impairment and other severance that comes through in that number. The majority of that cash -- that restructuring is noncash. So there's just a lumpiness here in the second quarter. I would tell you that when you look at the full year, we still expect our restructuring to be less than it was a year ago. We also expect that restructuring is going to continue as we drive that margin improvement for our Transit segment. We are consolidating footprints, taking steps to improve our productivity and improve margin overall. So there's still be more in the future, but down year-over-year."

I think there's always going to be, again, elements of variation in the quarter, as I had highlighted in terms of timing of projects. Mix can also be an element here, especially as you think about, well, speed of growth here on the Transit segment versus the Freight segment. But as you look into some of the other elements, even SG&A were consistent with 12% we had guided earlier in the year. So very much committed and executing for the $250 million of synergies that we have talked about. We expect to deliver those earlier in the second half of the year than later. And I think the other positives, we're moving forward into, what I'll call, a second phase of integration 2.0, which a lot of it is really tied to a continuous improvement culture, and that will continue to drive productivity.

Of course, when you compare the year-over-year, they become a little more challenging. I think the good news is when you look at the fleet that's running out there, I mean, you're really looking for reliability and availability. And those locomotives are running harder than they were before. Even though if you look at the overall fleet, you're not necessarily back to pre-COVID levels. I think we are positioned well here with the newer fleet, fleet that really provides, I'll call, the best reliability for customers, which is certainly needed right now when you look at improved being service levels ahead. So I wouldn't speculate in terms of the levels of unparking. This is an active dialogue we have with customers, and it involves not just the elements of unparking, it involves a strategy around modernizations, new locomotives. So it's a broader equation than just tied to unparking of existing fleets, which will potentially come with sometimes penalties tied to reliability of the overall system."

So we're very proud of moving forward on that. And then the hydrogen will lag by a couple of years behind that. There's more invention happening in the hydrogen. But when you look at what we're doing with GM right now, that's accelerating us both on the batteries as well as the hydrogen side there. And then I think one of the key points also is that we're also developing all the elements around it. It's a system that really works together. So the battery system working with the power conversion, working with trip optimizer to optimize all of that, even the breaking working to breaking in there, so can capture as much energy as possible and that's how we get to the 30% emissions and 30% fuel improvement."

Total sales",693,"Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. We delivered a strong second quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up sequentially and year-over-year. 
Total sales for the quarter were $2 billion, driven by growing demand in Freight services, Components and Transit but offset by weakness in the North America, OE and market. Adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, driven by ongoing lean initiatives, cost actions and the realization of synergies.
Total cash flow from operations was $223 million. This takes the year-to-date cash from operations to $515 million versus $229 million a year ago. It's a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance and focused working capital management. Cash conversion for the year is over 100%. 
Our year-to-date book-to-bill continues to be a positive story. We ended the first half of the year greater than 1, and we have a strong order pipeline for international locomotives. 
Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $21.5 billion, providing strong visibility into 2021 and beyond. 
Finally, we ended second quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.06, up 22% year-over-year. 
In the area of synergies, we are on track to achieve our full run rate of $250 million this year, and we are feeling the benefits of our footprint, consolidation and aggressive actions on structural cost. 
So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. I am confident that with strong execution, focused cost measures, our teams drive on productivity and continued improvements in our end markets, we will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth.
Now let's turn into Slide 5, to discuss a few of our recent business highlights, starting with a strategic partnership we recently announced with CSX. CSX will be the first railroad to implement Wabtec's Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero solution, which will allow them to start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it automatically using various controls. Zero-to-zero builds on trip optimizers, proven performance and is an important building block to autonomous rail and a critical component of energy management, which Eric will cover shortly. 
We're also partnering with them to revitalize their yard fleet through an innovative Tier 4 switcher modernization program, where we overhaul switchers to the latest Wabtec Tier 4 platform. Additionally, we are working with them to modernize their locomotive fleet with our FDL Advantage engine upgrade, which delivers another 5% reduction in fuel consumption. Some great examples of partnership and innovation at work. 
On the international front, commercial activity is increasing with multiyear orders in Equipment, Digital Electronics and Transit. In the second quarter, we closed a significant order for positive train control with Rumo, and we're now implementing PTC in 3 countries outside the U.S.
In addition, we won a key international locomotive deal in South America and a significant Transit contract with Metra in North America. Finally, when it comes to innovation and going after opportunities that can enhance our current portfolio, we announced a strategic partnership with General Motors, where we're exploring the use of battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies to accelerate the rail industry's path to zero-emission locomotives. This is an exciting space, one where strategic collaboration and investment will accelerate the path to more sustainable rail. 
Eric will share more on this in a moment. 
It's because of this breakthrough advancements and a commitment to innovation that Wabtec was named to Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2021 in recognition of our commitment to solve some of the world's toughest challenges in the transportation sector. It's also because of our proven commitment to innovation that we were able to further strengthen our financial position in the second quarter with a successful EUR 500 million green bond offering to fund investments that will continue to advance sustainable rail. 
Looking forward, we are confident, Wabtec will drive long-term profitable growth and lead the industry in advancing its position in sustainable rail even further. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will review the quarter and segment performance and our overall financial position."

We had solid operational and financial performance during the quarter. As markets continue to gradually recover, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on synergies, to generate strong cash flow and to invest in the future and position Wabtec for profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review the second quarter in more detail. Sales for the second quarter were $2 billion, which reflects a 16% increase versus the prior year, driven by a broad-based recovery across our portfolio, offset somewhat by lower North America OE Freight markets. 
For the quarter, operating income was $203 million, and adjusted operating income was $306 million, which was up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $103 million, of which $73 million was for noncash amortization and $30 million for restructuring, of which the majority was for our U.K. operations and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Nordco.  
Adjusted operating margin was 10 basis points higher than the second quarter last year and up from the first quarter. Versus last year, adjusted operating margin benefited from higher sales and the realization of synergies. 
Now looking at some of the detailed line items for the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was $254 million, which was 12.6% of sales. This was up from last year due to the normalization of certain expenses compared to the temporary cost actions taken during the depth of the pandemic a year ago. 
Adjusted SG&A excludes $9 million of restructuring and transaction expenses. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be about 12% of sales. We will continue to aggressively manage headcount and structural costs. 
Engineering expense increased from last year. This was largely due to higher volume outlook for the year. Overall, our investment in technology is still expected to be about 6% to 7% of sales. 
Amortization expense was $73 million. For 2021, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $290 million and depreciation expense of about $205 million. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 25.3%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to be about 26.3%. For the full year, we still expect an effective tax rate of about 26%. 
In the second quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.66, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.06. 
Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 7. Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 11% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by strong growth in services and aftermarket and higher demand for components. 
In terms of product lines, Equipment sales were down 2% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries in North America. In line with improving freight traffic, our services sales improved a solid 22% versus last year, and were up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by strong modernization deliveries, higher aftermarket sales from the unparking of locomotives and the acquisition of Nordco. 
I'd note the timing of mod deliveries vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our services sales to improve with the gradual recovery in Freight volumes. 
Digital Electronics sales were down 2% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America due to COVID disruption, yet we had strong momentum with book-to-bill over one for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety and improve productivity. 
Component sales were up 15% year-over-year, driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets. This is compared to a 19% lower railcar build year-over-year. Demonstrating the diversification within our components business, we are encouraged by railcars continuing to come out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and the broad recovery in industrial end markets. 
Freight segment adjusted operating income was $247 million for an adjusted margin of 18.5%. Versus last year, the benefit of synergies and cost actions were offset by sales mix as well as under-absorption due to lower locomotive deliveries. 
We will continue to execute on our synergy plans and further improve cost to drive margin improvement. 
Turning to Slide 8. Across our Transit segment, sales increased 27% year-over-year to $680 million, driven largely by recovery in OE projects and steady aftermarket sales. OE sales were up 41% year-over-year as the second quarter 2020 was severely impacted by disruptions stemming from the pandemic. OE sales were also up 12% sequentially, reflecting the continued momentum for investments in green infrastructure. 
Aftermarket sales were up about 17% from last year. We expect aftermarket sales to improve for the full year as economies continue to open and demand for Transit services increased globally. Adjusted segment operating income was $73 million, which was up 43% year-over-year for an adjusted operating margin of 10.8%, which is slightly down from the first quarter due to a charge for a discrete warranty adjustment of over $5 million. Across the segment, we continue to drive down cost and improve our project execution. We are committed to drive 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment in 2021. 
Now turning to Slide 9. We wanted to provide a more detailed look at our 12-month and multiyear backlog. We had another solid performance with total orders for the year exceeding $4 billion resulting in a book-to-bill for the year above 1. Orders can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but we are encouraged to see a broad-based momentum across the portfolio. 
Our Freight segment backlog remained strong at $17.8 billion with year-to-date book-to-bill above 1, driven by broad-based order activity across the portfolio. Our 12-month backlog of $4.1 billion is the highest since the third quarter of 2019, a result of improving end markets. We continue to see a robust pipeline of order opportunities, especially in international end markets. 
Our Transit segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.7 billion, with a 12-month backlog of $1.7 billion. We did see some projects push to the right as a result of ongoing disruption due to the pandemic, yet our outlook remained strong as sustainable infrastructure spending increases globally. 
And finally, at June 30, our multiyear backlog remained strong at $21.5 billion and continues to provide increasing forward visibility. 
Let's turn to our financial position on Slide 10. We had another solid quarter of cash generation. We generated $223 million of operating cash flow during the quarter bringing year-to-date cash flow generated over $0.5 billion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio. Cash flow was driven largely by good conversion of net income and focused working capital management. 
During the quarter, total CapEx was $29 million. In 2021, we expect CapEx to be about $140 million. During the quarter, we successfully completed a EUR 500 million green bond offering and paid down nearly $200 million in debt during the quarter. As a result, our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.6x, and our liquidity is robust at about $1.7 billion. 
As you can see in these results, our balance sheet remained strong, and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and grow shareholder value. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Rafael."

And shifting our focus to markets on Slide 11. We are continuing to see good signs of recovery. While the trough in the OE North America market remains, we are seeing sequential improvement in freight rail volumes. Total carloads were up 3% from first quarter and up 20% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong trends in intermodal along with a pickup in the industrial sector in areas like chemicals and metals. 
Locomotive parkings continued to improve due to increased Freight rail traffic, and we expect demand for reliability and productivity to increase, putting our services business in a position of strength. 
When it comes to North America railcar builds, railcars are coming back into use and about 22% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, but this is encouragingly below pre-COVID levels. 
As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve, and we forecast the railcar build for this year to be about 30,000 cars. Internationally, our order pipeline remained strong, and we expect long-term revenue growth in several markets. 
In mining, market conditions also continue to improve. Transitioning to the Transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets, but overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remained strong. Infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a focus, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport. 
Given this market backdrop, our strong performance in the first half and our confidence in our ability to deliver, we are raising our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We now expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.2 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.15 to $4.35. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90%, resulting in a strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year. So overall, positive signs of recovery, great execution by the team in the first half and a meaningful update to our full year view as we manage through the continued recovery. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Gebhardt."

I'm Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer for Wabtec and I'm thrilled to be here with you to share some of the transformative advancements we're driving in the clean energy transportation sector. Turning to",892,"Thanks, Rafael, and good morning, everyone. I'm Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer for Wabtec and I'm thrilled to be here with you to share some of the transformative advancements we're driving in the clean energy transportation sector. 
Turning to Slide 12. As you may be aware, today, rail represents the cleanest, most energy efficient and safest mode of moving freight and people on land, moving 40% of freight per tonne mile in the U.S. alone. Current trends indicate that freight and passenger activity will more than double by 2050 as the sector pushes for more sustainable transportation. 
At Wabtec, we're innovating to help our customers increase efficiency, reduce costs and cut their overall carbon footprint through the development of low-emitting locomotive technologies, including Tier 4 locomotives running on renewable fuels and battery electric locomotives. 
We're also pushing the boundaries into alternative fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and hydrogen, which I'll share more on in a moment. 
Over the last year, we built and tested in revenue operation with BNSF Railway and the California Air Resources Board, the world's first heavy haul 100% battery electric locomotive called FLXdrive. This locomotive, which operated in a consist between 2 other locomotives had a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours and generated most of its energy from regenerative braking. At the conclusion of this rigorous 3-month test that span 13,000 miles, the FLXdrive exceeded expectations, delivering more than an 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of eliminating 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel and flashing 69 tons of CO2 emissions. And it's just the beginning. At more than 7-megawatt hours, which is the next version of the FLXdrive, we currently have in development and expect to bring to market in 2023. We anticipate further reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30%. 
This reduction is tied to a tightly coupled system that Wabtec is driving in the marketplace that includes batteries, trip optimizer, power electronics and even our braking systems to capture all the available regenerative braking energy. And by owning the complete system, we can control the consist to optimize fuel burn or emissions, battery life or speed depending on the operators' need on a specific route. 
Our second-generation battery electric locomotive will operate independently and leverage General Motors Ultium battery technology, that Rafael mentioned earlier. It's a winning combination, where we bring our expertise in energy management and systems optimization for heavy haul locomotives, while taking full advantage of GM's advanced technologies and speed to market. 
In addition to these efforts, we're also reimagining the future of rail utilization, safety and logistics optimization. Our vision is to expand the use of freight rail, enable the elimination of over 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually across the global transportation network, reduce road congestion in our cities and make transportation significantly safer for everyone. 
Put us on this path, we've installed positive train control systems and software on more than 24,000 locomotives. This technology has revolutionized rail safety in the U.S. over the last decade and helped make the rail sector more efficient and effective. Our next-generation systems will take efficiency even further, by enabling moving block and virtual coupling instead of a traditional fixed block signaling use today, while still maintaining the most stringent safety standards. 
Similarly, our trip optimizer solution or smart cruise control system, which is installed on over 11,000 locomotives has helped save customers more than 400 million gallons of fuel and 4.5 million tons of CO2. Together, with Movement Planner, these digital solutions are revolutionizing locomotive fuel efficiency and real-time network planning. They're also helping move goods more efficiently using the existing rail network, all while reducing energy use, emissions and waste. 
Looking to the future on Slide 13, we will accelerate the shift to green energy solutions and bring to market a heavy haul zero-emission hydrogen hybrid locomotive. And we have a clear road map to get there, one that derisks across the path with batteries as a focal point across the entire spectrum and one that is already underway with FLXdrive. Our vision is to leverage battery technology while burning hydrogen in the internal combustion engine, similar to what we're doing today with natural gas in Florida. This step is a retrofittable approach, where we can take 80% to 90% of the energy content and make it hydrogen, driving a dramatic drop in emissions. 
In parallel, we will develop a hydrogen fuel cell locomotive and ruggedize the fuel cells so they can operate in a harsh rail environment. GM's hydrogen capabilities give us an advantage here as well. Their hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell power cubes are compact and easy to package and can be used in a wide range of applications, including locomotives. 
Our vision is clear, to have an operation fully decarbonized trains utilizing battery electric and hydrogen technology. The recent partnerships we announced with Carnegie Mellon University the nation's leading university in artificial intelligence and robotics and Genesee & Wyoming, the nation's largest short line and regional freight railroad put us on a path to do just that. By working together, we believe the transition to a more utilized, efficient and zero emission rail network is absolutely within reach, and we're committed to helping the industry get there.
With that, Rafael, I'll turn it back over to you."

And a great example of how we're driving breakthrough technology investments in scalable and sustainable products that will position Wabtec and the industry for long-term profitable growth.
Let's turn to our final slide. Everything we've outlined today reinforces our strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is based on our expansive installed base, deep expertise, innovation and breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies, rigorous operations, continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the second quarter despite a still challenging environment.
As we go forward, we will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of the company to execute on synergies, drive margin expansion, generate strong cash flow and deliver long-term profitable growth. As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first half of '21, I'm confident that the company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. We look forward to sharing more on the company, technologies and our long-term vision in the fourth quarter when we plan to host an Investor Day. More information on this will be shared shortly.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion."

If you look at it year-over-year, certainly, Transit is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio. And within Transit, certainly, OE is growing at a much faster rate. There's also elements of how underabsorption plays along the year. So as we look at it, there's an element of sometimes locomotive deliveries versus what the build plan is for the year. So overall, committed to really deliver on margin improvement for the year and better than what we guided early in the year."

A good example is PTC, as you mentioned. We're not executing it in 3 different countries outside the U.S. We've got a number of other countries, where we're discussing the opportunity. I think one of the things I would highlight about the business, this has been largely, as you look in the past, transactional business. So if the locomotive order dropped, you would see really pressure to revenues on our Digital Electronics segment. 
Our teams continue to take steps to further drive what I will call recurring revenues in the business. We expect some of these multiyear orders to continue. And I think a big chunk of the focus for this year is to drive convertibility for the business and improve the forecast for the year. But largely committed.

So when we look at moving forward, I think the focus on both reliability of the fleet, that's a significant positive for us when you look at our services business. The other element is the continued focus from customers down on really making sure that you're getting more productivity. And I think that will tie very well with some of the solutions that we have out there that dry fuel savings. We've talked about the FPL Advantage. There's also, I think, significant elements in terms of upgrades that we can continue to drive. You've heard about us implementing the Tier 4 engine with CSX now. 
This is something that we can apply not only to our platform but to other platforms out there as well. And we're really excited about the opportunity here on this energy transition with battery electric. We are currently responding to a number of really questions coming from request for quote and request for information from customers, not just in North America, around the world.

I think we are positioned well here with the newer fleet, fleet that really provides, I'll call, the best reliability for customers, which is certainly needed right now when you look at improving service levels ahead. 
So I wouldn't speculate in terms of the levels of unparking. This is an active dialogue we have with customers, and it involves not just the elements of unparking, it involves a strategy around modernizations, new locomotives. So it's a broader equation than just tied to unparking of existing fleets, which will potentially come with sometimes penalties tied to reliability of the overall system."

John is a well-respected leader with broad operational and financial experience. He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value. We're thrilled to have him on the team. 
I also want to take a moment to thank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service tape. We're grateful for all that he has contributed to the company. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework. And then John will cover the financials. Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up year-over-year. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven by growing demand in Freight Services and Components, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives and cost actions. Total cash flow from operations was $244 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago. This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance. Cash conversion for the year is at 103%. 
Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 20% year-over-year. Today, we're also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy run rate, a full year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition. We have consolidated and optimized our operations, reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise and created additional capabilities in vast cost countries. We are already feeling the benefit of these efforts, which will continue to improve our competitiveness. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. 
Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end market conditions in more detail. Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter across our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia, CIS, Brazil, Africa, Asia and Australia. Freight trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and auto production. 
Consumer and industrial activity continue to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials. Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase placing our services business in a position of strength. When it comes to the North America railcar build, demand for railcars is improving. About 21% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels. As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve. We forecast the railcar build this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars. 
Transitioning to the Transit sector, Ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally turn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong. 
Shifting to Slide 6. We are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector. Our commitment to succeed in this effort is underscored by our focus on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people over land. Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we're doing with our FLXdrive locomotive. We expect to extend this technology further to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero-emission rail network of the future. And we're not stopping there. 
We have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well. And we are driving several technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and pollutants. An example of this is our Green Friction Technology, which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90%, an incredible milestone in significantly improving the quality of air in our metros. 
We're also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network. A great example of this and a solution of growing interest among Class I customers is Trip Optimizer 020. This advanced technology allows an operator to autonomously start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control. It builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance, which has saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since its inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year. 
Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts towards cleaner, more energy-efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental, social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report, which will be released in a couple of weeks. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss how our next-gen technology is helping us win in the market by covering a few recent business highlights. In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLXdrive locomotive. We also closed a significant order for international locomotive kits and won a digital contract in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions. 
In Freight Services, we won a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for 100 locomotive modernizations in North America. Overall, MOD's backlog remains strong, and we are showing good momentum on deliveries. Finally, in Transit, we won new power collection, HVAC and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. 
Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs. We also will continue to control what we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply chain disruptions, increasing metal and commodity costs, and labor shortages. This dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases. 
Across the board, our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can. We anticipate that costs will continue to increase over the next few quarters, and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges. 
I'll turn the call over to John now to discuss this in more detail as well as review the quarter segment performance and our overall financial position. John?"

It's great to be with you, and I'm very excited to join the team at Wabtec. It is a storied company with incredible talent, deep innovation and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail while growing shareholder value. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face. During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products, as well as significant increases in many key input costs. On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips which are causing delays in production and customer delivery. We believe that our enterprise revenues were to 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales. 
The impacts to Wabtec's cost structure come in 4 areas: first, commodity inflation, where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper. The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics costs, which in many cases are up over 3 to 4x from pre-COVID levels. Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business. And finally, we are experiencing lost manufacturing efficiencies, largely due to component and ship shortages. Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our Freight and Transit segments. We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Having said that, we expect these headwinds to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts. We anticipate costs to continue to increase over the next few quarters. 
Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity and lean initiatives and finally, through higher realization of synergies. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our third quarter results in more detail. We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad-based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio, the acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales in Transit. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $325 million, which was up 10.6% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments, up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better than expected realization of synergies. As Rafael stated, during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $250 million of synergy run rate, a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted. 
What makes this quarter's margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the face of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment. Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs, and the acquisition of Nordco. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 12.25% of sales. 
Adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint. Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization. Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense, remains at 6% to 7% of sales. 
Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%. For the full year, we still expect to have an effective tax rate of about 26%, excluding discrete items. In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14, up 20% versus prior year. 
We are pleased with our Q3 results, in particular, our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the face of sharp cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. 
Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 10, starting with the Freight segment. Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth in our Services and Component businesses. In terms of product lines, Equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales. This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio. 
In line with an improved outlook for rail, our Services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year. The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives, and the acquisition of Nordco. The performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%. 
Digital Electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year, driven by delays in purchase decisions due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization. 
Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 6.7% year-over-year, driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end markets. 
Shifting to operating income for the segment. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio, and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter on the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million. Sales were down versus last year due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID-related disruptions. This was partially offset by positive ridership trends. Excluding near-term supply chain challenges, we estimate that transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis. We believe the medium- and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment. For the year, we remain committed to deliver about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment. And the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising cost and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near-term margin improvement. 
As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improved operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange. 
Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter for cash generation. We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio. During the quarter, total CapEx was $23 million, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $78.5 million. In 2021, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million. This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6x, and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, repurchasing $199 million of shares. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael."

We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong. As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter. Taking into consideration this market backdrop in volatile cost environment, combined with our solid performance in the first 3 quarters, we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. 
We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90%, resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year. 
Now let's turn to our final slide. Everything we have outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is built on our expansive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. 
I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost and market environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results. As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector. We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose: to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first 3 quarters of '21, I'm confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.

And this is a pipeline we continue to work on convertibility here. 
I think commodity demand remains overall strong for both agriculture and mining. In North America, even in the quarter, demand for services and support for both fuel savings and reliability remains strong. Locomotives are running harder. Demand for freight car is on the rise from the forecast we had earlier in the year. And I think most important, we are also continuing to build momentum on the battery electric solution with customers around the world. So this is not a question around demand. I think the adjustment we did in the guidance for the year reflects some of that disruption, including going to the fourth quarter, which is reflected in the guidance we provided."

Any way to think about the order of magnitude around that and the pickup you expect?"

Justin, with regards to the sequential and also year-over-year, the margin gains were about the same, year-over-year 1.7 points, on a sequential basis 2.1 points. The driver of that in the freight organization is really the mix between the groups and mix within the groups. When you look between the group, we had Services, which has got higher-than-average margin, up 13.6%. And Transit and the Equipment down anywhere between 2.5% and 5.7%. So that's really the driver of both the sequential and the year-over-year margin improvement. 
With regards to the cost side of the question. We talked about the $15 million to $20 million, and that's just in what has actually flown through the P&L. And so just to make sure that we're all straight, the largest of the predominance of that cost that we're seeing on the front end is for Freight and -- I'm sorry, yes, freight and logistics costs. Those don't flow through inventory and they hit us upfront. So the predominance of the $15 million to $20 million is in freight costs. 
The other piece of it is the materials rising. As everyone knows, it has risen a lot, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Now those get inventoried and they flow through inventory and they'll be released in the future as those products are sold. If we look at what's on the balance sheet, that's at about the same amount that we saw passed through the P&L in the third quarter. So there's another $15 million to $20 million sitting on the balance sheet that will come. And that's what we've talked about in the prepared remarks is that we would expect costs to rise in the fourth quarter and the next few quarters."

In terms of freight margin, yes, I'm sorry, certainly, mix was a driver, but the productivity and the synergy that the organization is spinning out is absolutely building our margins in those areas. Again, we talked about the synergy piece and achieving the overall synergies a year early. We're seeing some of the actual delivery of that flow through the P&L in the third quarter, as well as the entire organization focused on productivity and integrating these companies continues to drive strong productivity. And again, that's partially offset by escalating costs. 
So let's talk a little bit more about that. We know that the costs are up $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter. We know that that's going to grow into the first -- fourth quarter. And when we look at how we're going to cover that, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is we will do it through a series of price escalations, pricing and price surcharges, as well as a lot of hard work on accelerating productivity and kind of pushing off these cost increases as best we can. 
But to your question, let's talk a little bit about the price escalators. Again, over half the company's revenue is tied up and locked into long-term contracts. So we've got built-in protection for a situation as we're experiencing now. There's not a lot -- there's nothing that we have to do. It's already been predetermined for us on how these costs will be covered. So the question is, yes, there can be a lag. Various contracts have different start dates, some are monthly, and those adjust every month, quarterly and annual, so that we would expect over the next couple of quarters that we would continue to build up the revenue side of this cost equation and our track to be price cost neutral to positive as we go forward. The other piece of it, aside from the escalator, so a little bit less than half of the overall cost increases, are being dealt with pricing and price surcharges.
This has all been factored into the guidance, which we talked about of the increase 50 basis point increase in margins. And again, we're absorbing some of these costs and still hitting the guidance that we previously put out there."

John is a well-respected leader with broad operational and financial experience. He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value. We're thrilled to have him on the team. 
I also want to take a moment to thank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service to Wabtec. We're grateful for all that he has contributed to the company. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework. And then John will cover the financials. Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up year-over-year. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven by growing demand in Freight Services and Components, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives and cost actions. 
Total cash flow from operations was $244 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago. This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance. Cash conversion for the year is at 103%. Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 20% year-over-year. 
Today, we're also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy run rate, a full year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition. We have consolidated and optimized our operations, reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise and created additional capabilities in vast cost countries. 
We are already feeling the benefit of these efforts, which will continue to improve our competitiveness. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. 
Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end market conditions in more detail. Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter across our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia, CIS, Brazil, Africa, Asia and Australia. Freight trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and auto production. 
Consumer and industrial activity continue to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials. Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase, placing our Services business in a position of strength. 
When it comes to the North America railcar build, demand for railcars is improving. About 21% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels. As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve. We forecast the railcar build this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars. 
Transitioning to the Transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong. 
Shifting to Slide 6. We are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector. Our commitment to succeed in this effort is underscored by our focus on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people over land. 
Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we're doing with our FLXdrive locomotive. We expect to extend this technology further to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero-emission rail network of the future. 
And we're not stopping there. We have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well. And we are driving several technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and pollutants. An example of this is our Green Friction technology, which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90%, an incredible milestone in significantly improving the quality of air in our metros. 
We're also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network. A great example of this and a solution of growing interest among Class I customers is Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero. This advanced technology allows an operator to autonomously start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control. It builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance, which has saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since its inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year. 
Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts towards cleaner, more energy-efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental, social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report, which will be released in a couple of weeks.
Next, let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss how our next-gen technology is helping us win in the market by covering a few recent business highlights. In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLXdrive locomotive. We also closed a significant order for international locomotive kits and won a digital contract in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions. 
In Freight Services, we won a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for 100 locomotive modernizations in North America. Overall, mod's backlog remains strong, and we are showing good momentum on deliveries. Finally, in Transit, we won new power collection, HVAC and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. 
Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs. We also will continue to control what we can and leverage the strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply chain disruptions, increasing metal and commodity costs, and labor shortages. This dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases. 
Across the board, our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can. We anticipate that costs will continue to increase over the next few quarters, and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges. 
I'll turn the call over to John now to discuss this in more detail as well as review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. John?"

It's great to be with you, and I'm very excited to join the team at Wabtec. It is a storied company with incredible talent, deep innovation and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail while growing shareholder value. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face. During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products, as well as significant increases in many key input costs. 
On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips which are causing delays in production and customer delivery. We believe that our enterprise revenues were 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales. 
The impacts to Wabtec's cost structure come in 4 areas. First, commodity inflation, where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper. The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics costs, which in many cases are up over 3 to 4x from pre-COVID levels. Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business. And finally, we are experiencing lost manufacturing efficiencies, largely due to component and ship shortages. 
Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our Freight and Transit segments. We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Having said that, we expect these headwinds to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts. We anticipate costs to continue to increase over the next few quarters.
Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity and lean initiatives and finally, through higher realization of synergies. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our third quarter results in more detail. We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad-based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio, the acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales in Transit. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $325 million, which was up 10.6% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments, up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better-than-expected realization of synergies. 
As Rafael stated, during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $250 million of synergy run rate, a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted. What makes this quarter's margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the face of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment. 
Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs, and the acquisition of Nordco. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 12.25% of sales. Adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint.
Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization. Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense, remains at 6% to 7% of sales.
Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%. For the full year, we still expect to have an effective tax rate of about 26%, excluding discrete items. In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14, up 20% versus prior year. 
We are pleased with our Q3 results, in particular, our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the face of sharp cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. 
Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 10, starting with the Freight segment. Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth in our Services and Component businesses. In terms of product lines, Equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales. This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio. 
In line with an improved outlook for rail, our Services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year. The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives, and the acquisition of Nordco. The performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%. 
Digital Electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year, driven by delays in purchase decisions due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization. 
Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 6.7% year-over-year, driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end markets. 
Shifting to operating income for the segment. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio, and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter on the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million. Sales were down versus last year due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID-related disruptions. This was partially offset by positive ridership trends. Excluding near-term supply chain challenges, we estimate that transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis. We believe the medium- and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment. For the year, we remain committed to deliver about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment. And the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising cost and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near-term margin improvement. 
As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improved operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange.
Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter for cash generation. We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio. 
During the quarter, total CapEx was $23 million, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $78.5 million. In 2021, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million. This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6x, and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, repurchasing $199 million of shares. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael."

We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong. As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter. 
Taking into consideration this market backdrop in a volatile cost environment, combined with our solid performance in the first 3 quarters, we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90%, resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year. 
Now let's turn to our final slide. Everything we have outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is built on our expansive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. 
I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost and market environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results. 
As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector. We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose: to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first 3 quarters of '21, I'm confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future.

I mean when you look at the impact in the quarter, it's really tied to supply chain disruption. If anything, versus last time we talked, I'd say we have a stronger pipeline. If you think about the 12-month backlog, it's up double digits versus a year ago. This is the highest backlog we've had since, what, fourth quarter '19. And this is a pipeline we continue to work on convertibility here.
I think commodity demand remains overall strong for both agriculture and mining. In North America, even in the quarter, demand for services and support for both fuel savings and reliability remains strong. Locomotives are running harder. Demand for freight car is on the rise from the forecast we had earlier in the year. And I think most important, we are also continuing to build momentum on the battery electric solution with customers around the world. 
So this is not a question around demand. I think the adjustment we did in the guidance for the year reflects some of that disruption, including going to the fourth quarter, which is reflected in the guidance we provided."

Justin, with regards to the sequential and also year-over-year, the margin gains were about the same, year-over-year, 1.7 points; on a sequential basis, 2.1 points. The driver of that in the freight organization is really the mix between the groups and mix within the groups. When you look between the group, we had Services, which has got higher-than-average margin, up 13.6%. And Transit and the Equipment down anywhere between 2.5% and 5.7%. So that's really the driver of both the sequential and the year-over-year margin improvement. 
With regards to the cost side of the question. We talked about the $15 million to $20 million, and that's just in what has actually flown through the P&L. And so just to make sure that we're all straight, the largest of the predominance of that cost that we're seeing on the front end is for freight and -- I'm sorry, yes, freight and logistics costs. Those don't flow through inventory and they hit us upfront. So the predominance of the $15 million to $20 million is in freight costs. 
The other piece of it is the materials rising. As everyone knows, it has risen a lot, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Now those get inventoried and they flow through inventory and they'll be released in the future as those products are sold. If we look at what's on the balance sheet, that's at about the same amount that we saw passed through the P&L in the third quarter. 
So there's another $15 million to $20 million sitting on the balance sheet that will come. And that's what we've talked about in the prepared remarks is that we would expect costs to rise in the fourth quarter and the next few quarters."

One of the products, I think I've talked about it before, is PTC. It's probably an opportunity that is -- when I think about outside of the U.S. as big as the U.S. opportunity, we've started to execute now PTC into 3 different countries outside of the U.S. Now those are opportunities that -- it takes some time in terms of working those through. In a lot of cases, we're dealing also with governments on adopting it, but a very good positive progress up to this point.

In terms of freight margin, yes, I'm sorry, certainly, mix was a driver, but the productivity and the synergy that the organization is spinning out is absolutely building our margins in those areas. Again, we talked about the synergy piece and achieving the overall synergies a year early. We're seeing some of the actual delivery of that flow through the P&L in the third quarter as well as the entire organization focused on productivity and integrating these companies continues to drive strong productivity. And again, that's partially offset by escalating costs. 
So let's talk a little bit more about that. We know that the costs are up $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter. We know that that's going to grow into the first -- fourth quarter. And when we look at how we're going to cover that, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is we will do it through a series of price escalations, pricing and price surcharges as well as a lot of hard work on accelerating productivity and kind of pushing off these cost increases as best we can. 
But to your question, let's talk a little bit about the price escalators. Again, over half the company's revenue is tied up and locked into long-term contracts. So we've got built-in protection for a situation as we're experiencing now. There's not a lot -- there's nothing that we have to do. It's already been predetermined for us on how these costs will be covered. So the question is, yes, there can be a lag. 
Various contracts have different start dates, some are monthly, and those adjust every month, quarterly and annual, so that we would expect over the next couple of quarters that we would continue to build up the revenue side of this cost equation and our track to be price cost neutral to positive as we go forward. The other piece of it, aside from the escalator, so a little bit less than half of the overall cost increases are being dealt with, with pricing and price surcharges.
This has all been factored into the guidance, which we talked about, of the increase -- 50 basis points increase in margins. And again, we're absorbing some of these costs and still hitting the guidance that we previously put out there."

The second thought that I have on the topic is what a great problem to have. The company has done a fantastic job of becoming very consistent on delivering a very strong cash conversion ratio. And as we look at this quarter, $1 billion of free cash. 
So number one is to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, which the company has and continue to strengthen that. The second area, Allison, is to continue to invest in the organic side of the business. I've been here now for 7, 8 weeks, and I've seen a lot of capital requests, and the returns are absolutely fantastic on those investments in terms of driving improved profits over that period of time. 
And then finally is the remainder of the cash. We will look at M&A and share buybacks no differently. We'll prioritize the returns to the shareholders and we'll continue to buy back as we did in the third quarter. So again, a great quarter in terms of share buybacks at $199 million, and we'll apply what makes sense in terms of strategic acquisitions and look to how do we continue to drive the shareholder value of the company forward."

As you remember, a couple of quarters ago, the company talked about U.K. restructuring. And so these are our contracts that we're exiting because they weren't delivering the level of profits that we would expect from our transit organization. 
So those are the 2 pieces that explain the bulk of the reduction from the second quarter to the third quarter. What I'd also point out, Matt, is when you look on a year-over-year basis, so a year ago quarter, 12-month backlog is actually up very strong. It's up over 10%."

John is a well-respected leader with broad operational and financial experience. He is already bringing a great perspective to our business and long-term strategy with a clear focus on growing shareholder value. We're thrilled to have him on the team. 
I also want to take a moment to thank Pat Dugan for his nearly 20 years of service to Wabtec. We're grateful for all that he has contributed to the company. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 4. I will start with an update on our business, my perspective on the quarter and our long-term value framework. And then John will cover the financials. Overall, we made significant progress against our strategy and delivered a strong third quarter, as noted by our sales growth, adjusted margin and adjusted earnings per share, each of which were up year-over-year. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven by growing demand in Freight Services and Components, but offset by continued weakness in the North America OEM market. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, driven by strong mix and productivity, ongoing lean initiatives and cost actions. 
Total cash flow from operations was $244 million. This takes year-to-date cash from operations to $759 million versus $458 million a year ago. This is a solid illustration of how the team is driving good operational performance. Cash conversion for the year is at 103%. Finally, we ended third quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 20% year-over-year. 
Today, we're also pleased to share that we have achieved our $250 million synergy run rate, a full year earlier than expected at the time of the GE Transportation acquisition. We have consolidated and optimized our operations, reduced costs to drive stronger profitability, accelerated lean across the enterprise and created additional capabilities in [best] cost countries. 
We are already feeling the benefit of these efforts, which will continue to improve our competitiveness. So overall, really strong execution by the team as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategy. 
Shifting our focus to Slide 5. Let's talk about our end market conditions in more detail. Internationally, freight activity continued to improve in the third quarter across our major markets, and our order pipeline remains strong. We expect long-term revenue growth in Russia, CIS, Brazil, Africa, Asia and Australia. Freight trends in North America weakened slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, not driven by lack of demand but by global supply chain disruption that has impacted intermodal volumes and auto production. 
Consumer and industrial activity continue to spur volume growth in chemicals, metals and materials. Locomotive parkings continued to decline despite weaker freight traffic in the quarter. We expect demand for reliability, productivity and fuel efficiency to continue to increase, placing our Services business in a position of strength. 
When it comes to the North America railcar build, demand for railcars is improving. About 21% of the North American railcar fleet remains in storage, a slight improvement from the previous quarter and in line with pre-COVID levels. As a result, industry orders for new railcars are starting to improve. We forecast the railcar build this year will be in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars. 
Transitioning to the Transit sector, ridership remains a bit uneven in some markets. However, infrastructure spending for green initiatives continue to be a bright spot, especially as governments globally churn to rail for clean, safe and efficient transportation. Overall, the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain strong. 
Shifting to Slide 6. We are developing innovative solutions that address the main cost drivers for our customers, including fuel efficiency and increased velocity in the transportation sector. Our commitment to succeed in this effort is underscored by our focus on continuing to position rail transportation as the safest and most sustainable way to move freight and people over land. 
Today, we have the capability and expertise to transition diesel-powered locomotives to battery power and drastically reduce emissions as we're doing with our FLXdrive locomotive. We expect to extend this technology further to hydrogen fuel cells and help lead the industry to a zero-emission rail network of the future. 
And we're not stopping there. We have extended battery technology to other areas of our business as well. And we are driving several technology breakthroughs to boost transit efficiency and reduce emissions and pollutants. An example of this is our Green Friction technology, which drastically reduces brake emissions by up to 90%, an incredible milestone in significantly improving the quality of air in our metros. 
We're also leading the change to create a safer and more efficient rail network. A great example of this and a solution of growing interest among Class I customers is Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero. This advanced technology allows an operator to autonomously start a train from 0 miles per hour and stop it using software integrated with positive train control. It builds on Trip Optimizer's proven performance, which has saved railroads more than 400 million gallons of fuel since its inception and reduces emissions by over 500,000 tons per year. 
Looking forward, we will continue to advance efforts towards cleaner, more energy-efficient transport and will share our progress on this front as well as our broader environmental, social and governance priorities in our next sustainability report, which will be released in a couple of weeks.
Next, let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss how our next-gen technology is helping us win in the market by covering a few recent business highlights. In the third quarter, we secured new orders for our FLXdrive locomotive. We also closed a significant order for international locomotive kits and won a digital contract in Asia to help our customers improve asset utilization and reduce emissions. 
In Freight Services, we won a significant long-term service contract as well as an order for 100 locomotive modernizations in North America. Overall, mod's backlog remains strong, and we are showing good momentum on deliveries. Finally, in Transit, we won new power collection, HVAC and service contracts in Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. 
Looking ahead, we are confident Wabtec will continue to capture growth with innovative and scalable technologies that address our customers' most pressing needs. We also will continue to control what we can and leverage this strength to combat the current challenges that we are facing due to supply chain disruptions, increasing metal and commodity costs, and labor shortages. This dynamic have adversely impacted our third quarter results and have resulted in significant cost increases. 
Across the board, our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these pressures by triggering price escalations and surcharges as well as driving operational efficiencies wherever we can. We anticipate that costs will continue to increase over the next few quarters, and we will continue to aggressively manage these challenges. 
I'll turn the call over to John now to discuss this in more detail as well as review the quarter, segment performance and our overall financial position. John?"

It is a storied company with incredible talent, deep innovation and best-in-class differentiated technologies that is well positioned to deliver the future of rail while growing shareholder value. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Before getting into the financials, we would like to discuss the dynamic cost environment and supply chain challenges that we face. During the third quarter, we experienced delays in production and deliveries of our products, as well as significant increases in many key input costs. 
On the revenue side, we are experiencing adverse impacts to our sales results due to shortages across many component parts, including computer chips which are causing delays in production and customer delivery. We believe that our enterprise revenues were 2% to 3% lower than they would have been without the supply chain disruptions and that the majority of these lower revenues represent delayed sales, not lost sales. 
The impacts to Wabtec's cost structure come in 4 areas. First, commodity inflation, where markets year-over-year are up more than 200% for steel, 94% for aluminum and roughly 40% for copper. The second area of impact is elevated freight and logistics costs, which in many cases are up over 3 to 4x from pre-COVID levels. Third is wage inflation and labor availability, which are adversely impacting the business. And finally, we are experiencing lost manufacturing efficiencies, largely due to component and chip shortages. 
Our costs have increased during the quarter and have impacted both our Freight and Transit segments. We estimate that cost increases in the third quarter are in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Having said that, we expect these headwinds to intensify as the full cost of rising metals and lower manufacturing efficiencies work their way through our inventories and purchase contracts. We anticipate costs to continue to increase over the next few quarters.
Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures and supply chain disruptions by triggering price escalation clauses that are included in many of our long-term contracts, implementing price surcharges, driving operational productivity and lean initiatives and finally, through higher realization of synergies. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our third quarter results in more detail. We had good operational and financial performance during the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $1.91 billion, which reflects a 2.2% increase versus the prior year. Sales were positively impacted by the continued broad-based recovery we are experiencing across much of our portfolio, the acquisition of Nordco and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America OE locomotive market and lower year-over-year sales in Transit. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $325 million, which was up 10.6% versus the prior year. Most notably, we delivered margin expansion in both our segments, up 1.3 percentage points on a consolidated basis. Margins were aided by strong mix favorability, improved productivity and better-than-expected realization of synergies. 
As Rafael stated, during the quarter, we achieved our goal of $250 million of synergy run rate, a significant milestone delivered a full year earlier than originally forecasted. What makes this quarter's margin expansion even more impressive is the fact that our margin gains were achieved in the face of an incredibly dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment. 
Looking at some of the detailed line items for the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $257 million, which was up $16.1 million from the prior year due to the normalization of certain expenses, higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs, and the acquisition of Nordco. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 12.25% of sales. Adjusted SG&A excludes $12 million of restructuring and transition expenses, of which most was allocated to further optimize our European footprint.
Engineering expense increased from last year. We continue to invest engineering resources and current business opportunities, but more importantly, we are investing in our future as an industry leader in decarbonization and digital technologies that improve safety, productivity and capacity utilization. Our 2021 investment in technology, which includes engineering expense, remains at 6% to 7% of sales.
Amortization expense was $72.5 million and our adjusted effective tax rate during the quarter was 24.8%, bringing our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 25.8%. For the full year, we still expect to have an effective tax rate of about 26%, excluding discrete items. In the third quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.14, up 20% versus prior year. 
We are pleased with our Q3 results, in particular, our sales growth in the face of supply chain disruptions, our margin growth in the face of sharp cost increases. We remain diligent and proactive as we work to minimize these challenges. 
Now let's take a look at segment results on Slide 10, starting with the Freight segment. Across the Freight segment, total sales increased 4.7% from last year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by continued strong growth in our Services and Component businesses. In terms of product lines, Equipment sales were down 5.7% year-over-year due to fewer locomotive deliveries this quarter versus last year and no new locomotive deliveries in North America, partially offset by strong mining sales. This year-over-year performance demonstrates the resiliency of our equipment portfolio. 
In line with an improved outlook for rail, our Services sales grew a robust 13.6% versus last year. The year-over-year sales increase was largely driven by higher aftermarket sales from our customers modernizing their fleets, the unparking of locomotives, and the acquisition of Nordco. The performance, reliability and availability of our fleet continues to drive customer demand as railroads increasingly look for predictable outcomes across their fleet. Excluding Nordco, organic sales for the third quarter were up 6.1%. 
Digital Electronics sales were down 3.6% year-over-year, driven by delays in purchase decisions due to economic and cost uncertainties as well as chip shortages. We continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our Digital Electronics product line as customers globally focus on safety, improved productivity, increased capacity and utilization. 
Component sales continued to show recovery and were up 6.7% year-over-year, driven by demand for railcar components and recovery in industrial end markets. We remain encouraged by the continuing trend of railcars coming out of storage, higher order rates for new railcars and accelerated recovery across industrial end markets. 
Shifting to operating income for the segment. Freight segment adjusted operating income was $266 million for an adjusted margin of 20.6%, up 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. The benefit of higher volumes, improved mix across our portfolio, and increased synergies and productivity were partially offset by significantly higher input costs. Finally, segment backlog was $18.2 billion, up $375 million from the prior quarter on the broad multiyear order momentum that Rafael discussed across the segment. 
Turning to Slide 11. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 2.5% year-over-year to $612 million. Sales were down versus last year due in large part to supply chain issues and COVID-related disruptions. This was partially offset by positive ridership trends. Excluding near-term supply chain challenges, we estimate that transit sales would have been up slightly on a year-over-year basis. We believe the medium- and long-term outlook for this segment remains positive as infrastructure spending for green initiatives continues. 
Adjusted segment operating income was $77 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Across the segment, we continue to drive down costs and improve project execution despite the volatile cost environment. For the year, we remain committed to deliver about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the segment. And the team continues to take aggressive action to mitigate rising cost and supply chain disruption, which will pressure the pace of near-term margin improvement. 
As we execute in the fourth quarter, we expect significantly improved operating margin driven by strong productivity gains, improved project mix and more favorable comps versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Finally, Transit segment backlog for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was flat with the prior quarter after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange.
Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter for cash generation. We generated $244 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash flow generated to over $759 million. This performance clearly demonstrates the quality of our business portfolio. 
During the quarter, total CapEx was $23 million, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $78.5 million. In 2021, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million. This is $20 million lower than our previous guidance as the team judiciously manages every dollar of spend. 
Our adjusted net leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.6x, and our liquidity is robust at $1.62 billion. Also during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, repurchasing $199 million of shares. As you can see in these results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we are confident we can continue to drive solid cash generation, giving us the liquidity and flexibility to allocate capital towards the highest return opportunities and to grow shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rafael."

We believe that the underlying customer demand for our products and the end market momentum remains strong. As John indicated, we do expect continued headwinds from a more challenging sales and cost environment into the fourth quarter. 
Taking into consideration this market backdrop and volatile cost environment, combined with our solid performance in the first 3 quarters, we are narrowing our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. We expect sales of $7.9 billion to $8.05 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. We expect cash flow conversion to remain greater than 90%, resulting in strong cash generation of about $1 billion for the full year. 
Now let's turn to our final slide. Everything we have outlined today reinforces that we have a clear strategy to accelerate long-term profitable growth. That strategy is built on our expansive installed base and deep industry expertise grounded in innovation, breakthrough initiatives and scalable technologies that drive value for our customers and accelerated by our lean continuous improvement culture and disciplined capital allocation. 
I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter despite a challenging supply chain, cost and market environment. You are seeing their efforts in the strength of the company and our financial results. 
As we go forward, the rail sector is well positioned to increase share and address the critical issues facing the world's freight and logistics sector. We will continue to lean into the strong fundamentals of this industry and our company to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
As we've said before, Wabtec's mission holds a larger purpose: to move and improve the world. After demonstrating strong performance in the first 3 quarters of '21, I'm confident that this company will continue to deliver and lead the transition to a more sustainable future. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?"

I mean when you look at the impact in the quarter, it's really tied to supply chain disruption. If anything, versus last time we talked, I'd say we have a stronger pipeline. If you think about the 12-month backlog, it's up double digits versus a year ago. This is the highest backlog we've had since, what, fourth quarter '19. And this is a pipeline we continue to work on convertibility here.
I think commodity demand remains overall strong for both agriculture and mining. In North America, even in the quarter, demand for services and support for both fuel savings and reliability remains strong. Locomotives are running harder. Demand for freight car is on the rise from the forecast we had earlier in the year. And I think most important, we are also continuing to build momentum on the battery electric solution with customers around the world. 
So this is not a question around demand. I think the adjustment we did in the guidance for the year reflects some of that disruption, including going to the fourth quarter, which is reflected in the guidance we provided."

Justin, with regards to the sequential and also year-over-year, the margin gains were about the same, year-over-year, 1.7 points; on a sequential basis, 2.1 points. The driver of that in the freight organization is really the mix between the groups and mix within the groups. When you look between the group, we had Services, which has got higher-than-average margin, up 13.6%. And Transit and the Equipment down anywhere between 2.5% and 5.7%. So that's really the driver of both the sequential and the year-over-year margin improvement. 
With regards to the cost side of the question. We talked about the $15 million to $20 million, and that's, Justin, what has actually flown through the P&L. And so just to make sure that we're all straight, the largest or the predominance of that cost that we're seeing on the front end is for freight and -- I'm sorry, yes, freight and logistics costs. Those don't flow through inventory and they hit us upfront. So the predominance of the $15 million to $20 million is in freight costs. 
The other piece of it is the materials rising. As everyone knows, it has risen a lot, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Now those get inventoried and they flow through inventory and they'll be released in the future as those products are sold. If we look at what's on the balance sheet, that's at about the same amount that we saw pass through the P&L in the third quarter. 
So there's another $15 million to $20 million sitting on the balance sheet that will come. And that's what we've talked about in the prepared remarks is that we would expect costs to rise in the fourth quarter and the next few quarters."

In terms of freight margin, yes, I'm sorry, certainly, mix was a driver, but the productivity and the synergy that the organization is spinning out is absolutely building our margins in those areas. Again, we talked about the synergy piece and achieving the overall synergies a year early. We're seeing some of the actual delivery of that flow through the P&L in the third quarter as well as the entire organization focused on productivity and integrating these companies continues to drive strong productivity. And again, that's partially offset by escalating costs. 
So let's talk a little bit more about that. We know that the costs are up $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter. We know that that's going to grow into the first -- fourth quarter. And when we look at how we're going to cover that, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is we will do it through a series of price escalations, pricing and price surcharges as well as a lot of hard work on accelerating productivity and kind of pushing off these cost increases as best we can. 
But to your question, let's talk a little bit about the price escalators. Again, over half the company's revenue is tied up and locked into long-term contracts. So we've got built-in protection for a situation as we're experiencing now. There's not a lot -- there's nothing that we have to do. It's already been predetermined for us on how these costs will be covered. So the question is, yes, there can be a lag. 
Various contracts have different start dates, some are monthly, and those adjust every month, quarterly and annual, so that we would expect over the next couple of quarters that we would continue to build up the revenue side of this cost equation and are on track to be price cost neutral to positive as we go forward. The other piece of it, aside from the escalator, so a little bit less than half of the overall cost increases are being dealt with, with pricing and price surcharges.
This has all been factored into the guidance, which we talked about, of a 50 point increase -- 50 basis point increase in margins. And again, we're absorbing some of these costs and still hitting the guidance that we previously put out there."
