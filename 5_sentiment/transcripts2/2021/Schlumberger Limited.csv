Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor to questions. 
First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both safety and service quality, 2 strong foundation of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note. And I'm extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the new year. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the 4 divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international market and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth ahead of rig activity. 
In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably on land, our well construction and surface system growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced headcount. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services, supporting share activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All in all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power and a very solid free cash flow conversion. 
Now let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the company globally. And in North America, we scale to fit and high-graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins. 
Second, we capitalize on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customer workflow and key drivers in the new industry landscape. The digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbons operation and the priorities for step change in production recovery, maximizing reserve performance and well construction, integration and efficiency. 
On digital, I'm partly proud of our achievement in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which includes enterprise-wide deployment, AI partnership and expanding use case of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our business during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021. 
Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology, multiple low- or zero-carbon new energy -- carbon energy venture. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes venture in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning's earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for this venture during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years.  New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months. 
Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customer to provide solution for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations. And reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP Climate Change Program assessment to a peer-leading A-. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 CHG emission intensity within 1 year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal. 
Now I would like to share some of our view on the 2021 outlook. Absent of the new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macrodrivers developing through the course of the year. In the near term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil price well above crisis levels, while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021. 
In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in Well Construction and Completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels as continued capital discipline and the impact of consolidations will cap the spending level and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario, and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase. And we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long cycle after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021, we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digit. This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger, both in North America and internationally. We expect all divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis, excluding OneStim, to post full year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020, with the growth trajectory across the different divisions, shaped by the NAM international mix and the relative exposure to short- and long-cycle markets. 
Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021, with an ambition to achieve 200 to 300 bps -- 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full year 2020 and consequently, visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions, combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from the market that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long- and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021. 
I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater details. Stephane?"

Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.22.

Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets. 
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the company. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed 2 key previously announced transactions: the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds. 
As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward. 
Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially, while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong EPS results in Ecuador as well as higher digital solutions and multiclient sales internationally. 
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East and Asia. Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim's margin did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher, excluding OneStim. 
Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2%, and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in Surface Production Systems. 
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021 and, in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance. 
Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency-denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow. 
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue. 
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we would see -- will have seen the trough for international market in the third quarter, and we expect this to start to rebound in the fourth, which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down. And I think we, here, used the breadth of our offering, both short and long cycle, the exposure we have, which is very broad, very diverse to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international market and realize some gain or casually on market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. So we believe that, first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long cycle, our performance, which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back, are the fundamental of our market position internationally. 
Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fleet for basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customer recognize and ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward. So when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have, indeed, we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits on H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate. And then we anticipate that this will continue and having been strengthening in '22 and '23."

I think the police is multifacets, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and, hence, gain productivity in today planning fee development and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pool for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we've built on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity and collaboration. So that's the first pool. 
The second pool is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking ways to extract more value from the data that they own. And hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there's this platform that the industry has adopted for which we contributed ourselves, the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us, and you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East where the goal is to create AI solution for -- and with ADNOC and with [GOD42] to deploy in the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit for this data insight. And finally, we see customers putting into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. So these are the 3 pools we see, and we are offering that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement it last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So we see customers in all region having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for the workflow, unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU, and reaching out to operation and unlocking to edge application the automation and application of AI to operation. So we see this across multiple region and all the customer at time."

Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks.

So ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market condition allow us, between 2021 and full year 2020. And this will exceed vis-à-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. So we see this will be driven by 3 factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our 1.5 permanent structural cost reduction. Secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021. And finally, following incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the firewall market mix, if I may, and the strength for fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and leade to us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019 despite being significantly down on top line. 
So division per division, we anticipate actually from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think there's a performance by the exit of OneStim will, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand Well Construction due to efficiency. And market growth will also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and the rationale and the drivers for this expansion."

So I'm not sure that I will have -- I will take the time to comment on each and every one of these. So let me comment briefly on the Genvia. So indeed, Genvia is a venture we have credit with partners, including research arms of the -- in France to indeed industrialize, commercialize oxide electrolysis technology. That is set to be changing EBITDA, the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We obviously have ambition to be participating to that market and create and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometime using for reversibility in fuel cells and most of the time used to produce hydrgoen. So ambition is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to our partners that will use it in full cell or hydrogen production. And from that point on, in the next 2 or 3 years, make a decision, a critical decision to build and expand into a large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. So each of these venture that we are entering into is using the same multisteps approach where we invest in technology. We test the market with partners. And we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourselves for scale. So that's the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive project, but leveraging our domain, subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture, and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis."

But Olivier, how do you think about what this means for recovery potential on a multiyear basis?

And if we assume that the next 2 or 3 years will not give us the activity, intensity and investment to recover this 2 million barrel, what will happen is that this 2 million barrel will have to be supplied internationally, hence, the market share of supply will change in favor international market. When you equate this and assume that the old demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think this we create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023, 2025 latest horizon. Hence, it match our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025. This will benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023. So that's our hypothesis going forward is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next 2 or 3 years."

I think, let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results, indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth to sort of the [indiscernible] units, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore units from Guyana to Brazil, from the other places around the world where we had in West Africa did grow. So that is a fact. That's -- and indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets, clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. So we had some, indeed, traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in term of actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But I think the offshore of deepwater specifically was up. 
Now going forward, we don't see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually a gain, the rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward into the teens in term of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single-digit as well as land. So when you combine all of this, that give us our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter. And our anticipated rebound for long cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater will give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half."

I think we are here having the ambition a credit division that will supplement the 4 divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium, is very significant. So I don't want to go into any detail. But I think I just mentioned and give you the example of the 70 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million [tonnes] of CCS that will have to be captured between early end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon and lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade comes. So each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. 
Now the reason why we are maybe unique in position into our this. First, we have a domain that is relevant in experience into this, partly in CCS and and geothermal.

The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So I think the rates and the range of contract will -- we are engaged with with our customers are very broad from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute or the customers are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us is the is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. 
So to give you an example. I don't think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single-million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows, and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, Software-as-a-Service, or Data as a Service for the long run. So this typical contract is 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract."

So I believe that it's time to start to close. I think we are running out of time, the clock. So thank you, everyone. And I think to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter, the last quarter built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. 
Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining productions and international activity rebound to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all divisions to post-incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020 and for the company to expand full year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. 
Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry. The chapter on digital is an impactive for industry in efficiency, a chapter where innovation and technology will impact redevelopment, asset performance and production recovery and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers. And at the same time, we continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive yet resilient return and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. 
In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor to questions.  
First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both safety and service quality, 2 strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I'm extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the new year. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the 4 divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international market and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth ahead of rig activity.  
In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably, on land, our well construction and surface system growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services, supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All in all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power and a very solid free cash flow conversion.  
Now let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the company globally. And in North America, we scaled to fit and high-graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins.  
Second, we capitalize on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customer workflow and key drivers in the new industry landscape. The digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbons operation and the priorities for step change in production and recovery, maximizing reserve performance and well construction, integration and efficiency.  
On digital, I'm particularly proud of our achievement in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformations at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which includes enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership and expanding use case of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our business during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021.  
Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology, multiple low- or zero-carbon new energy carbon -- energy venture. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes venture in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning's earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for this venture during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months.  
Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solution for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP climate change program assessment to a peer-leading A-. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity within 1 year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal.  
Now I would like to share some of our view on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil price well above crisis levels while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021.  
In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels as continued capital discipline and the impact of consolidations will cap the spending level and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021, we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digit. 
This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger, both in North America and internationally. We expect all divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis, excluding OneStim, to post full year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020, with the growth trajectory across the different divisions shaped by the NAM/international mix and the relative exposure to short- and long-cycle markets.  
Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021, with an ambition to achieve 200 to 300 bps -- 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full year 2020 and consequently, visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions, combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long- and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021.  
I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater details. Stephane?"
301966,698771214,2178994,"Schlumberger Limited, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2021",2021-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year",829,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets.  
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the company.  
During the fourth quarter, we completed 2 key previously announced transactions: the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds.  
As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward.  
Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong EPS results in Ecuador as well as higher digital solutions and multiclient sales internationally.  
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East and Asia. 
Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim's margin did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher excluding OneStim.  
Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2%, and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. 
Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems.  
  
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021 and, in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance.  
Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency-denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow.  
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue.  
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we would see -- will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter and we expected these to start to rebound in the fourth, which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down. And I think we used the breadth of our offering, both short and long cycle, the exposure we have, which is very broad, very diverse, to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally, on market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. 
So we believe that, first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long cycle, our performance which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward.  
So when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have -- indeed, we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate, and then we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in '22 and '23."

I think the pull is multifaceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and, hence, gain productivity into their planning, field development and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we've built it on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity and collaboration. So that's the first pull. 
The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own, and hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted, for which we contributed ourselves the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us. And you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East, where the goal is to create AI solution for -- with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploying the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit from this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. 
So these are the 3 pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So we see customers in all region having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow; unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU; and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application the automation and application of AI to operation. So this -- we see this across multiple region and all the customer type."

Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks.

So ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full year 2020. And this will exceed vis-a-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. 
So we see this will be driven by 3 factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our $1.5 billion permanent structural cost reduction. Secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America, that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the favorable market mix, if I may, and the strength of our fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 20 -- 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019 despite being significantly down on top line. 
So division per division, we anticipate actually from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim, we'll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand Well Construction due to efficiency. And market growth, we'll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and the rationale and the drivers for this expansion."

So indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France, to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We've obviously ambition to be participating in that market and create -- and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. 
So ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production and from that point on, in the next 2 or 3 years, make a decision -- a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. 
So each of these venture that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourself for scale. So that's the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive projects but leveraging our domain -- subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCUS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis."

When you equate this and assume that the old demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023-2025, latest, horizon. Hence, it matched our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 so we'll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023.

I think -- let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth, the sort of offshore drill units, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore drill units from Guyana to Brazil, from the other places around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. 
So that is a fact. That's -- and indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana, that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. 
So we had some, indeed, traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in terms of rig -- actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. 
Now going forward, we don't see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually, again, the rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward, into the teens in terms of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single digits as well as land. So when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter and our anticipated rebound for long cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half."

But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think we are here having the ambition to create a division that will supplement the 4 divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium is very significant. 
So I don't want to go into any detail, but I think I'll just mention and give you the example of the 70 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tonnes of CCUS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon. And lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. 
Now the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this, first, we have a domain that is relevant, and experience, into this, partly in CCUS and in geothermal. Second, I think we have a track record of industrialization and development of technology at scale. And third, I think we know how to partner and deliver technology and deploy technology and solution everywhere in the world with any partners. And you will see announcement coming in the next few weeks and few months as we'll illustrate that at scale."

I think we have mentioned in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release that we anticipate after a strong quarter the usual seasonal dip, partly, in international market. We see that every year and we have seen it for the last 10 years. We don't see it different this year. I think we don't see it as a pronounced dip, but we see it as a usual, I would say, seasonal effect that we see affecting Russia, affecting some of China or offshore market in the first quarter. 
When it comes to North America, I will again differentiate between offshore. That will transition from a quarter where we delivered some subsea and some multiclient, significant impact on the third quarter -- on the fourth quarter from -- into the first quarter. Whereas, in the land market activity, as we mentioned, we foresee a continuity of activity pickup that will transition from the growth rate we have seen in the last part of last year, and that will continue. And we see this growing at the same rate, both on rig and on completion activity."

So we start from a very low base. We may maintain it around the $1.5 billion, but we want to leave ourselves a little bit of room to capture the growth we are starting to see, particularly in the international market. We want to be ready to deploy CapEx in the most lucrative markets, and we don't want to miss the opportunity. So we will monitor and modulate accordingly, but we will stay within the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.

I think obviously, we are very proud of this large enterprise deployment contract that we have earned with OMV, and we'll work with them over the next few quarters to roll out our solution and create unique AI workloads that will accelerate and step change their positive efficiency for their own operation. 
But this -- I think to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we're working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So I think the rates and the range of contract we'll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad, from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute or the customers that are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us. It is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. 
So to give you an example, I don't think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single-million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, software as a service, or data as a service for the long run. So this typical contract is 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract."

So I believe that it's time to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So thank you, everyone. 
And I think to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter -- the last quarter built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. 
Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining productions and international activity rebound to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020 and for the company to expand full year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. 
Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry. The chapter on digital is an imperative for industry inefficiency, a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance and production recovery and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers, and at the same time, we continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive yet resilient return and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. 
In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor to questions.  
First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both safety and service quality, 2 strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I'm extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the new year. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the 4 divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international market and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth ahead of rig activity.  
In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably, on land, our well construction and surface system growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services, supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All in all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power and a very solid free cash flow conversion.  
Now let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the company globally. And in North America, we scaled to fit and high-graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins.  
Second, we capitalize on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customer workflow and key drivers in the new industry landscape. The digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbons operation and the priorities for step change in production and recovery, maximizing reserve performance and well construction, integration and efficiency.  
On digital, I'm particularly proud of our achievement in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformations at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which includes enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership and expanding use case of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our business during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021.  
Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology, multiple low- or zero-carbon new energy carbon -- energy venture. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes venture in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning's earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for this venture during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months.  
Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solution for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP climate change program assessment to a peer-leading A-. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity within 1 year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal.  
Now I would like to share some of our view on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil price well above crisis levels while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021.  
In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels as continued capital discipline and the impact of consolidations will cap the spending level and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021, we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digit. 
This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger, both in North America and internationally. We expect all divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis, excluding OneStim, to post full year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020, with the growth trajectory across the different divisions shaped by the NAM/international mix and the relative exposure to short- and long-cycle markets.  
Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021, with an ambition to achieve 200 to 300 bps -- 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full year 2020 and consequently, visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions, combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long- and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021.  
I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater details. Stephane?"

Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year",829,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets.  
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the company.  
During the fourth quarter, we completed 2 key previously announced transactions: the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds.  
As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward.  
Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong EPS results in Ecuador as well as higher digital solutions and multiclient sales internationally.  
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East and Asia. 
Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim's margin did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher excluding OneStim.  
Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2%, and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. 
Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems.  
  
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021 and, in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance.  
Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency-denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow.  
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue.  
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we would see -- will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter and we expected these to start to rebound in the fourth, which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down. And I think we used the breadth of our offering, both short and long cycle, the exposure we have, which is very broad, very diverse, to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally, on market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. 
So we believe that, first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long cycle, our performance which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward.  
So when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have -- indeed, we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate, and then we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in '22 and '23."

I think the pull is multifaceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and, hence, gain productivity into their planning, field development and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we've built it on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity and collaboration. So that's the first pull. 
The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own, and hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted, for which we contributed ourselves the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us. And you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East, where the goal is to create AI solution for -- with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploying the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit from this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. 
So these are the 3 pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So we see customers in all region having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow; unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU; and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application the automation and application of AI to operation. So this -- we see this across multiple region and all the customer type."

Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks.

So ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full year 2020. And this will exceed vis-a-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. 
So we see this will be driven by 3 factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our $1.5 billion permanent structural cost reduction. Secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America, that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the favorable market mix, if I may, and the strength of our fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 20 -- 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019 despite being significantly down on top line. 
So division per division, we anticipate actually from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim, we'll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand Well Construction due to efficiency. And market growth, we'll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and the rationale and the drivers for this expansion."

So indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France, to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We've obviously ambition to be participating in that market and create -- and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. 
So ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production and from that point on, in the next 2 or 3 years, make a decision -- a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. 
So each of these venture that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourself for scale. So that's the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive projects but leveraging our domain -- subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCUS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis."

When you equate this and assume that the old demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023-2025, latest, horizon. Hence, it matched our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 so we'll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023.

And at the same time, we will benefit from the full year effects of our cost-out program, which are all cost savings, and the discipline on CapEx. So we don't see working cap as a big headwind. We will be able to offset this with the underlying cash flow performance and get, for sure, to this double-digit free cash flow margin within the -- in 2021."

I think -- let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth, the sort of offshore drill units, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore drill units from Guyana to Brazil, from the other places around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. 
So that is a fact. That's -- and indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana, that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. 
So we had some, indeed, traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in terms of rig -- actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. 
Now going forward, we don't see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually, again, the rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward, into the teens in terms of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single digits as well as land. So when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter and our anticipated rebound for long cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half."

And for sure, before the midyear, I think we will come with a much better view for all of you on where we participate. 
But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think we are here having the ambition to create a division that will supplement the 4 divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium is very significant. 
So I don't want to go into any detail, but I think I'll just mention and give you the example of the 70 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tonnes of CCUS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon. And lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. 
Now the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this, first, we have a domain that is relevant, and experience, into this, partly in CCUS and in geothermal. Second, I think we have a track record of industrialization and development of technology at scale. And third, I think we know how to partner and deliver technology and deploy technology and solution everywhere in the world with any partners.

That will transition from a quarter where we delivered some subsea and some multiclient, significant impact on the third quarter -- on the fourth quarter from -- into the first quarter.

But this -- I think to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we're working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So I think the rates and the range of contract we'll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad, from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute or the customers that are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us. It is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. 
So to give you an example, I don't think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single-million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, software as a service, or data as a service for the long run.

And every project and every commercial engagement is different, so it's very difficult to make any projection or any trends. 
I believe that we gave a little bit of indication of the highly accretive margins, and we believe that this is true and holding true for the entire portfolio we have. I would not want to comment project -- or contract by contract."

And we'll continue to work with partners, continue to spend and allocate a large portion of our engineering effort into this. And we believe that we are well covered to create the growth pattern that we have announced going forward. 
So I believe that it's time to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So thank you, everyone. 
And I think to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter -- the last quarter built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. 
Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining productions and international activity rebound to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020 and for the company to expand full year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. 
Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry. The chapter on digital is an imperative for industry inefficiency, a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance and production recovery and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers, and at the same time, we continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive yet resilient return and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much."

In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I",1329,"Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. 
In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor to questions.  
First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both safety and service quality, 2 strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I'm extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the new year. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the 4 divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international market and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth ahead of rig activity.  
In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably, on land, our well construction and surface system growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services, supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All in all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power and a very solid free cash flow conversion.  
Now let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the company globally. And in North America, we scaled to fit and high-graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins.  
Second, we capitalize on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customer workflow and key drivers in the new industry landscape. The digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbons operation and the priorities for step change in production and recovery, maximizing reserve performance and well construction, integration and efficiency.  
On digital, I'm particularly proud of our achievement in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformations at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which includes enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership and expanding use case of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our business during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021.  
Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology, multiple low- or zero-carbon new energy carbon -- energy venture. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes venture in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning's earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for this venture during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months.  
Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solution for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP climate change program assessment to a peer-leading A-. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity within 1 year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal.  
Now I would like to share some of our view on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil price well above crisis levels while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021.  
In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels as continued capital discipline and the impact of consolidations will cap the spending level and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021, we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digit. 
This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger, both in North America and internationally. We expect all divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis, excluding OneStim, to post full year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020, with the growth trajectory across the different divisions shaped by the NAM/international mix and the relative exposure to short- and long-cycle markets.  
Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021, with an ambition to achieve 200 to 300 bps -- 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full year 2020 and consequently, visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions, combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long- and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021.  
I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater details. Stephane?"
301966,698771214,2252406,"Schlumberger Limited, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2021",2021-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year",829,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets.  
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the company.  
During the fourth quarter, we completed 2 key previously announced transactions: the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds.  
As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward.  
Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong EPS results in Ecuador as well as higher digital solutions and multiclient sales internationally.  
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East and Asia. 
Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim's margin did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher excluding OneStim.  
Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2%, and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. 
Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems.  
  
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021 and, in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance.  
Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency-denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow.  
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue.  
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we would see -- will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter and we expected these to start to rebound in the fourth, which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down. And I think we used the breadth of our offering, both short and long cycle, the exposure we have, which is very broad, very diverse, to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally, on market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. 
So we believe that, first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long cycle, our performance which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward.  
So when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have -- indeed, we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate, and then we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in '22 and '23."

I think the pull is multifaceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and, hence, gain productivity into their planning, field development and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we've built it on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity and collaboration. So that's the first pull. 
The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own, and hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted, for which we contributed ourselves the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us. And you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East, where the goal is to create AI solution for -- with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploying the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit from this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. 
So these are the 3 pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So we see customers in all region having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow; unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU; and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application the automation and application of AI to operation.

And maybe you could discuss that or pull that apart a little bit on the biggest drivers of this expansion. Is it digital predominantly or other divisions?

Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks. So ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full year 2020. And",348,"Yes. Good question, Angie. Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks. So ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full year 2020. And this will exceed vis-a-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. 
So we see this will be driven by 3 factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our $1.5 billion permanent structural cost reduction. Secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America, that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the favorable market mix, if I may, and the strength of our fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 20 -- 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019 despite being significantly down on top line. 
So division per division, we anticipate actually from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim, we'll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand Well Construction due to efficiency. And market growth, we'll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and the rationale and the drivers for this expansion."

So I'm not sure that I will have -- I will take the time to comment on each and every one of these. So let me comment briefly on the Genvia. 
So indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France, to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We've obviously ambition to be participating in that market and create -- and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. 
So ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production and from that point on, in the next 2 or 3 years, make a decision -- a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. 
So each of these venture that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourself for scale. So that's the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive projects but leveraging our domain -- subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCUS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis."

Hence, the market share of supply will change in favor international market. 
When you equate this and assume that the old demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023-2025, latest, horizon. Hence, it matched our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 so we'll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023. So that's our hypothesis going forward, is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next 2 or 3 years."

I think -- let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth, the sort of offshore drill units, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore drill units from Guyana to Brazil, from the other places around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. 
So that is a fact. That's -- and indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana, that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. 
So we had some, indeed, traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in terms of rig -- actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. 
Now going forward, we don't see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually, again, the rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward, into the teens in terms of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single digits as well as land. So when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter and our anticipated rebound for long cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half."

But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think we are here having the ambition to create a division that will supplement the 4 divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium is very significant. 
So I don't want to go into any detail, but I think I'll just mention and give you the example of the 70 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tonnes of CCUS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon. And lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. 
Now the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this, first, we have a domain that is relevant, and experience, into this, partly in CCUS and in geothermal.

So we start from a very low base. We may maintain it around the $1.5 billion, but we want to leave ourselves a little bit of room to capture the growth we are starting to see, particularly in the international market. We want to be ready to deploy CapEx in the most lucrative markets, and we don't want to miss the opportunity. So we will monitor and modulate accordingly, but we will stay within the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. 
As it relates to CapEx only, yes, I think it will be closer to 5% with the current equipment, the capacity we have and the capital efficiencies we have realized, but we'll leave a bit of flexibility. We'll monitor, but we'll stay within the range we stated for total capital investments."

I think obviously, we are very proud of this large enterprise deployment contract that we have earned with OMV, and we'll work with them over the next few quarters to roll out our solution and create unique AI workloads that will accelerate and step change their positive efficiency for their own operation. 
But this -- I think to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we're working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So I think the rates and the range of contract we'll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad, from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute or the customers that are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us. It is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. 
So to give you an example, I don't think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single-million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, software as a service, or data as a service for the long run. So this typical contract is 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract."

So I believe that it's time to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So thank you, everyone. 
And I think to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter -- the last quarter built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. 
Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining productions and international activity rebound to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020 and for the company to expand full year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. 
Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry. The chapter on digital is an imperative for industry inefficiency, a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance and production recovery and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers, and at the same time, we continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive yet resilient return and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much."

Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our first quarter results, our progress on our performance strategy, and finally, our outlook for the second quarter and second half of the year. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. 
The first quarter of 2021 was a strong step forward. The quarter unfolded as we anticipated, with acceleration in North America activity and momentum continuing to build in the international market, aside from the usual seasonal effects. We executed very well within that context. We expanded our global operating margins for the third consecutive quarter, and free cash flow was once again solidly positive. 
Here are some highlights in support of this performance. Well construction sustained growth sequentially and in North America outpaced U.S. land rig count, demonstrating enhanced market participation in the recovery. Reservoir Performance grew when adjusted for the OneStim divestiture. Digital & Integration delivered another strong quarter with resilient margins on track for our full year target. In North America, execution of our returns-focused strategy drove strong margin expansion, fully aligned with our double-digit margin target. And in international markets, despite severe seasonality and relative exposure in Russia and China, we continue to grow across geographies. 
In this environment, as the industry prepares for an upcycle, performance matters, and decision on contract awards and capacity allocation are increasingly driven by technology and execution. We are very pleased with the outcome of several international multiyear contract awards, specifically in Middle East and in offshore, building a pipeline that will support growth in 2022 and beyond. 
We are determined to drive performance differentiation, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and digital capabilities. This combination benefited our integration performance, with our largest LSTK operations achieving a 6% improvement in drilling efficiency during the quarter. This strong start of the year, characterized by resilient revenue, sequential margin expansion and positive free cash flow position us very well to meet our full year financial ambitions and to deleverage our balance sheet. I want to congratulate the entire Schlumberger team, who delivered strong execution for our customers, having positioned us for the growth that is now underway. 
Next, I would like to comment on 3 elements of our performance strategy that present further opportunity for growth in this upcoming cycle and beyond: digital, sustainability and Schlumberger New Energy. Starting with digital. 18 months ago, we stated our ambition to lead the digital transformation in our industry and to significantly grow new digital revenue streams. I want today to update you with our progress. 
Our digital strategy is a platform strategy, leveraging unique and open platforms, DELFI, OSDU and Agora. Since launching our core DELFI platform, we have significantly expanded its market reach from Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure and more recently, using IBM Red Hat technology to enable hybrid cloud and offer fit-for-basin cloud solutions, as highlighted this morning in our collaboration with Yandex. 
We'll continue to execute on this platform journey to expand the choice for our customers and to support our 3 digital business streams: workflow, data and operations. First, we offer our customers the opportunity to transition their technical workflows from the desktop to the cloud to realize productivity gains from DELFI workflow integration, collaboration and access to scalable cloud computing. Our market leadership on the desktop position us very well to capture this market. 
In the last 18 months, our customers have increasingly transitioned to the cloud, resulting in 50% growth of our contract backlog and a tenfold increase in full-time DELFI users. As we expand our cloud-native application and enable additional workflow within DELFI, we expect increased adoption across our customer base, resulting in steady growth of our digital workflow revenue. 
Second, recognizing that data is the key to unlock the industry's digital transformation, we worked with the industry OSDU Forum to open source and contribute the underlying DELFI data ecosystem, helping to establish OSDU as the industry standard, an essential step to liberate data scale for AI applications and to enable multivendor interoperable workflows. In this context, we recently partnered with Microsoft to offer Azure customer access to our OSDU enterprise data management solution. We've augmented this offering with additional AI capabilities and will also expand our geographical reach. The market potential for this data business stream is very significant as it underpins every customer digital transformation as exemplified by our recent announcement with Equinor. 
Third, our customer operations represent a unique opportunity to realize the promise of asset and field digital solution. We designed an open IoT platform, Agora, to enable edge applications, complementing our DELFI platform operational workflows and integrating with our partner, Sensia. Using Agora and DELFI, we are deploying digital operation solutions for drilling and production, both with our customers and as part of our integrated projects. This digital offering can significantly impact our own operations, as was demonstrated this quarter in the Ecuador project and in our main LSTK operations and also greatly benefit our customers. Our ambition is to establish critical market share in this white space and accelerate collaboration with industry partners to further its adoption. 
These 3 digital business streams, workflow, data and operation, built on open platform are supporting our digital growth ambition. We are very pleased with the progress on our platform foundation with the adoption by a broad set of customers and are confident in the success of each business stream as we execute our road maps. 
Moving now to sustainability. We are strengthening our commitment to action, particularly as the industry face a decarbonization mandate and world leaders have reaffirmed commitments or advanced stronger goals in recent days. As it relates to climate action, this goes beyond reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions, as we believe there is a significant opportunity for our technology and operating practice to decisively impact and accelerate the industry's decarbonization effort, as well as contribute towards emission reduction goals around the world. 
Our technology portfolio includes solutions that help our customers eliminate flaring, reduce fugitive methane emissions and leverage automation and digital surveillance to reduce environmental impact. This technology focus on low-carbon impact will be an increasing element of differentiation for Schlumberger in the future. 
An example that resonates with our customer is the complete electrification of offshore production systems, as outlined in our earnings release with the BP project for subsea electrification. This is the next offshore frontier, and it will also pave the way to full digital enablement. 
Beyond our industry, our CCS partnership with LafargeHolcim and the bioenergy CCS project in Mendota, California are examples of cross-sectors initiatives aligned with climate actions. Specifically, in Schlumberger New Energy, we reached milestones in a sector where we are participating across the energy transition: hydrogen, lithium, CCS, geothermal and geo-energy. During the quarter, we established and accelerated new ventures, formed strategic partnerships and gained market exposure and are progressing in derisking technology for upscaling. 
We'll continue to build out the New Energy portfolio throughout the year, and we will keep you updated on our progress. We are extremely proud of the tangible results we have realized in only a short time as it clearly outlines the power of the Schlumberger brand and the potential of this new chapter for the future of the company. 
Turning to the outlook. Upward revision in global economic forecast, growth forecast by the IMF and positive demand forecast adjustment by both IEA and OPEC reinforce the transition into a demand-led recovery, which will strengthen through the second half of 2021, absent new setbacks in vaccination rollouts or easing of lockdown. Against this backdrop, we are increasingly confident in our full year activity outlook. 
In North America, in the second quarter, we see sustained activity growth in U.S. land and the seasonal rebound of North America offshore being partially offset by the Canada backup. As our first quarter results have shown, particularly in Well Construction, our new mix and sizable exposure in the North America market will increasingly contribute to our results. 
Moving to international markets. Activity growth will broaden in the second quarter with the seasonal recovery in Russia and China, augmenting continued growth in Africa and the Middle East while Latin America should remain resilient. In addition, the offshore recovery will continue in the second quarter, including the gradual return of exploration and appraisal in key international markets. 
The depth and diversity of our international franchise give us a great exposure to this market expansion, especially in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, which will lead in the second quarter. More broadly, we anticipate all divisions to grow sequentially at different pace and margin expansion to be led again by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. In light of this, directionally, we expect total second quarter revenue to grow in mid-single digits and our operating margins to further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. 
Looking further into the second half of 2021. In North America, the pace of growth is expected to moderate on budget exhaustion and seasonal effect but could surprise to the upside, resulting in full year growth when excluding the impact of divestiture. In the international markets, our confidence in the second half outlook has been strengthening based on the latest international rig count trends, CapEx signal and customer engagement. International activity will broaden and accelerate in the second half, impacting short to long cycle, both on land and offshore, including the productivity in the most advantaged offshore basins. 
The magnitude of these leading indicators, combined with upward revisions to global economic growth and demand recovery, present the potential from -- for an even stronger inflection than initially anticipated for the second half of the year. Therefore, we have greater confidence in the previous guidance of a double-digit increase in international revenue in the second half when compared to the same period last year. And absent of a setback in a post-economic -- post-pandemic recovery, we foresee an upside for full year growth internationally, resulting in a stronger footing as we enter 2022. 
In the context of this top line growth and the steps we took to reset the earnings power, we are confident that we will fully realize our operating leverage to deliver our full year ambition of 250 to 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year. We expect to continue expanding during -- margins during the recovery to support increasing cash flow throughout the year, which should provide subsequent deleveraging opportunities. Now I would like to pass the call to Stephane."
301966,708002832,2256360,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2021",2021-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share was $0.21. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021.

There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this represents a decrease of $0.01 sequentially and $0.04 when compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Overall, our first quarter revenue of $5.2 billion decreased approximately 6% sequentially. However, if we adjust for the OneStim and artificial lift low-flow divestitures, which were completed during the fourth quarter of last year, revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite the first quarter seasonality. Excluding the impact of divestitures, North America revenue increased 10% sequentially, reflecting a significant activity increase on land, partially offset by lower product sales offshore. 
International revenue declined only 3% sequentially despite the effects of the extended winter period we experienced in Russia and the usual seasonality in the Far East. Pretax operating margins were 12.7% and have now increased for 3 quarters in a row. In addition, pretax operating margins were 230 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. This represents the highest margin since the third quarter of 2019. This strong margin performance reflects the significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost-out program, which is now essentially complete. 
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.1% for the first quarter were flat sequentially as the positive impact of the OneStim divestiture was offset by the seasonal effects we typically experience in the first quarter. EBITDA margins were 203 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $773 million decreased 7% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower sales of digital solutions and multiclient licenses. Margins only decreased by 37 basis points to 32% as the effects of the digital solutions and multiclient revenue declines were largely offset by improved profitability from APS projects. 
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1 billion decreased 20% sequentially. However, excluding the impact of the divested OneStim business, revenue increased 3% despite seasonally lower revenue in Russia and China. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East. 
Margins increased [ 260 ] basis points to 10.2%, largely due to the divestiture of the OneStim business that was dilutive to the division's fourth quarter margins. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 4% sequentially, and margins increased 103 basis points to 10.8% and due to increased activity in North America land and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in drilling activity in Russia and China. 
Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% sequentially. International revenue declined 4% while North America was down 3%. Despite the revenue decline, margins only decreased 71 basis points to 8.7% as a result of cost measures as well as improved profitability in midstream production systems due to higher activity. 
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $429 million of cash flow from operations and positive free cash flow of $159 million despite severance payments of $112 million and the increase in working capital requirements we always experienced in the first quarter due to the annual payout of employee incentives. Our cash flow will improve throughout the rest of the year, consistent with our historical quarterly trends. 
Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.7 billion, a decrease of $207 million when compared to the end of the previous quarter. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $270 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. 
On that note, let me take the opportunity to provide you with a quick update on our capital stewardship program. Optimizing the allocation of our capital investments will be critical to maximize the benefits of the ongoing activity recovery, which is poised to accelerate in the next few quarters. As part of the company's reorganization, we implemented a new capital allocation framework that governs all types of investments. The underlying principle behind the framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow before any other metric. 
At the corporate level, this framework allows us to critically assess our technology portfolio and rationalize our offering to reduce capital intensity and maximize returns. At the division level, we have strengthened our processes to ensure that new assets as well as existing assets are deployed where they will generate the highest returns. We are also leveraging this capital discipline to drive commercial behaviors and improve the quality of our revenue. 
With this in place, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit cash flow margin -- free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to deleverage the balance sheet, which remains a top priority for us. It is worth noting that during the quarter, the 2 major credit rating agencies confirmed our long-term credit ratings of A2 and A, respectively, and both cited our expected strong cash flow profile and our commitment to deleveraging. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

I think first, I think -- I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by or before the end of 2022. In this context, I believe that we are ready and starting at -- and during the second half of this year, facing the beginning of a demand-led recovery that will trigger a multiyear recovery cycle and industry upcycle. 
In this context, if you look at the recent period of underinvestment, look at the structural constraints in North America due to capital discipline, I believe that this will create the condition to create a significant pool on international supply. So this will support international supply activity buildup not only at the end of this year but well into '22 and '23. 
In addition to this, I believe that the offshore, being a unique market, a privileged market for IOCs, some NOCs and focused independents will also see a gradual but very strong recovery over the long term. It is the offshore advantaged basins represents extremely good oil production plateau for some basins at low carbon footprint, so this will support also the long-term international recovery. 
So we believe really that we are very well positioned to outperform in this macro because we believe that this macro outlook that would include a growing international mix, including offshore, will play very well to our strength. In addition, we have accelerated our strategy transformation, both the organizational transformation and key strategic elements that will place very well from efficiency performance focus from our capital stewardship, our fit-for-basin that is resonating very well for our customer and finally, for our digital and decarbonization strategic focus we are putting. 
So I believe that we are seeing the beginning of this multiyear growth. We are also seeing that our performance strategy is resonating very well for customers, and we have been awarded several multiyear contract that is -- that are creating the backlog we need to support this growth going forward. So yes, I'm optimistic not only on the second half of this year but on an accelerated path in 2022 and the long cycle strength, including offshore in '22, '23 and beyond."

First, I think is the -- as I described, is the very favorable macro outlook that combined the pace of international growth, the offshore element and also, as we are saying to see this quarter, the return of exploration and appraisal activity that is still needed to replenish the reserve and also that is becoming more near fleet exploration close to the offshore hubs in particular. So these factors are very favorable. 
Secondly, I believe that we have created quality revenue initiatives as part of our initiatives. First, fit-for-basin. Fit-for-basin technology is creating the premium that differentiate us in some critical basin, in some critical assets and give us the premium for revenue quality improvement. Similarly, I think our technology access, as we have seen in North America, has played a great role in helping us to expand market but also to command premium with our technology partner. 
And finally, the success of digital will be accretive over the period to this. So the third element, I think, beyond this strategy, I think, is the step change we expect to materialize into our integration contracts. From a performance efficiency using digital, as we have demonstrated already, using fit technology and using practice that are becoming best-in-class. So we believe that these 3 elements, the backdrop, the key element of our strategy for revenue quality and the enhanced margin on our integrated contract will all combine conditions for further margin expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion going forward."

In Saudi, I think it's more related to performance and activity share awards that resulted from our performance in execution in the quarter. 
And I think we see this factor of a strong market position we have, of performance differentiation to help us go forward. So that's to maybe support and substantiate what we see going forward. In addition to this, as we have seen from last quarter to this quarter, we did announce some critical awards that are securing or expanding this market position Middle East. 
Now there is a lot of LSTK and some of our peers have talked about large and very large contract tenders underway, so I cannot and will not comment on this as these are under way. But what I can say is that the activity is rebounding, the activity outlook, both land and offshore in Middle East, is and will be strengthening. So our customers are indeed securing capacity and looking for best performer and looking for, in a sense, the condition that will make them successful in their ambition to augment their capacity and augment their production going forward.

It was interesting to hear you talk about the 3 elements of the workflow, data and operations. So I'm just wondering if you could just maybe expand a bit on how you see each the pace of growth in each of those and what is that dependent upon? 
Partly I'm wondering, is the customers just getting more comfortable in using digital and day-to-day operations? But do you also need to build out new software applications or maybe it's just something else?"

So first, there has been a catalyst in the last 18 months that accelerated adoption of digital. That's the first. 
We believe that our platform strategy is being recognized, accepted and across different customer type from national company to independent to the IOCs, as you have seen, there is a large adoption of this because we have kept this platform open. Now when it comes to the pace and growth factor that differentiates workflow, data and operation, I believe that workflow is the 1 that is the most mature because it builds on our existing desktop market leadership we have. And here, we are transitioning the existing customer base we have towards the cloud. 
And each of them is realizing the power of the cloud from productivity, from collaboration, from access to scalable cloud computing, we simply need to reassure them that our platform is open and that they can make the choice, their choice on the cloud infrastructure, which we are doing. 
The second data, I think, is renaissance of the data market that used to be a major market in digital 20 years ago. Everybody realized that without the data, we cannot unlock the power of digital transformation. So thankfully, the industry has come together and has created this OSDU platform, Open Subsurface Data Universe, driven by the open forum, and we have been fortunate to technically contribute our DELFI ecosystem to this. So on that foundation, every company will have to roll out and will certainly use the opportunity to roll out OSDU as a platform so that it unlocks the data access, liberate the data and then data provider and then service provider, a consulting company and the customer themselves will tap into this data using AI application, and this is where we want to participate, both the data transition to this new platform and the AI opportunity upon this. 
Finally, operation. Operation is the biggest price long term but also the most difficult to realize because every asset, every infrastructure on the feed, every infrastructure at the edge is different. So while we believe that there is an immense opportunity to use digital in operation, and we are doing it very successfully internally, the complexity, the system integration needs and the fit-for-purpose digital deployment will slow down on the adoption of this. Yet we'll make progress and we'll continue to partner with other companies to make sure that we offer integrated offering to the industry. 
When you combine these 3 at the different pace of growth, you create the condition for multiplicity of revenue stream that will support our [ double ] digital ambition that we'll realize within the decade."

And the way we decided to go after this is to first identify and selectively, the domain in which we believe we can leverage our strength, the subsurface can leverage our strengths, our technology and global footprint to create and forge partnership, technology, acquisition or organically grow the domain. 
So first, we have decided to explore and establish market position and diversify our market entrants into this domain. So you have seen that we have, in parallel, from lithium to CCS, from hydrogen to geo-energy and geothermal venture, each of them with potentially a different partner for addressing a different industry sector, so that we diversify not only our approach but diversify and expand our market reach. So that has been the first is to make sure that we diversify our investments, diversify our market approach and our type of partnership. So that has been our first, I would say, framework that we have used to develop this. 
Now what is our ambition there? Ambition is to create the future of the company in the long run. So within the decade and within the next 2 or 3 years, specifically, we will derisk at scale this technology investment, these venture investments, working with our partners, working internally to develop those technology as we are for green hydrogen, as we will with our CCS Mendota bioenergy plant or with LafargeHolcim for CCS and cement plant. We will work, develop, embark into venture where we will derisk, enhance and then when it is derisked at scale, will then make bigger investments, large investments that will then support the long-term growth."

But again, it will depend on how do we differentiate for performance, how do we make sure that our technology is unique and is in high demand and create the condition for the customer to accept to a premium on this technology. And that's our approach. 
Now whether the capacity -- global capacity will create, in a short term, global pricing, I don't think it will but I think it will, certainly in the coming quarters, create pricing inflection on some business lines in some basins.

There is a typical seasonality in the working cap and free cash flow throughout the year. So free cash flow will improve quarter after quarter like it has in the past and we will deliver that ambition. 
It can be enhanced by exceptional proceeds. We are continuously looking at our portfolio, as I mentioned earlier. We are particularly working on 2 key divestitures: one is I mentioned in the previous quarter in regards to our APS portfolio. We are looking at launching very soon in the next few days, actually a formal process for the APS asset in Canada. There's a lot of interest still and the economics have improved quite a bit. So we are quite hopeful there to close a good transaction. 
And the second 1 is the rigs we have in the Middle East. We are actually even more advanced there. We are in a formal process. We have shortlisted a few interested buyers and they are just concluding the due diligence. So we should be closing or at least signing, sorry, this transaction in the next few months. So this will enhance the cash flow profile and the potential reduction of our net debt and the flexibility it will give on liquidity basically."

I think first, it's worth saying that offshore basins and the most advantaged offshore basins are still very much very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, IOCs, some unique NOCs and a few independents th",347,"That's a great question. I think first, it's worth saying that offshore basins and the most advantaged offshore basins are still very much very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, IOCs, some unique NOCs and a few independents that are pure-play offshore independents from relative medium to large size. So first, this resource are precious. This resource typically have a good geology. And as I said, both from the production plateau, they provide and/or the low-carbon opportunity they have in terms of mix of API grade, I think this excellent resource. 
The second thing I believe is that the economics for offshore due to integration success, feed technology and digital practice have improved from the last cycle. And I think opportunity exists for the industry to leverage this and accelerate some FID going forward. So another factor that is very critical as you touch the exploration appraisal is that most of the major and large NOC on this -- in this context are recognizing the impact of exploiting hubs, offshore hubs. And the offshore hubs, the opportunity is to exploit those hubs to improve the return on asset, improve return on infrastructure and focus on near-field or backyard exploration so that they maximize the return on existing infrastructure, existing FPSO, existing platform so that it is also something that plays very well in our portfolio for or for back as we are expanding in this domain. 
So I believe that the exploration appraisal will not necessarily accelerate in frontier exploration but will accelerate in near-field exploration offshore, and we're starting to see this, this quarter and will accelerate during the second half of the year. So I'm optimistic indeed on offshore. And if you read some of the or IHS reports or some of the report highlighting the FID pipeline, you see that the FID pipeline that are pre-committed towards '22, '23 have the potential over '22, '23 and beyond to eclipse the last 2017, 2019 in terms of number of projects but also in terms of total CapEx invested in deepwater."

I think first, the production system, I think, is not only subsidy system as both short and long cycle as exposure in short cycle in North America to the ESP, which is coming back strongly, and they came on surface equipment also servicing the frac and our partner, Liberty. And also -- and internationally, it's indeed a mix of short for ASP and some completion equipment and long cycle for midstream as well as for subsea and surface equipment. 
So it's a mix of long and short with very tangible exposure in North America, benefiting short term and long term international long cycle, both recovery and production new projects. In that context and back to the point on offshore, I believe that the subsea market is very alive. And I think last year, the number of subsidiaries were short of 200 compared to higher than [ 50 ] in 2019. The prediction this year is to be above 200, 220 is our prediction and is aligned with the market tradition. And this will be more or less increasing going forward gradually to be within between 250 to 300 over the midterm period to support this offshore project."

The second is that we are still on track, okay, and very confident on our 250 to 300 bps full year margin expansion.

But also there are some persistent but temporary COVID-related constraints and cost that as the lockdown are still in place in many countries, that are adding cost upfront into those mobilization and making this mobilization cost maybe a little bit more than they would have been in the past. So these are the factors that are shaping up, but we are very confident that the margin expansion is in place and will continue going forward."

So thank you, and to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaway: first, the macroeconomic and activity outlook are increasingly supporting an attractive industry upcycle, characterized with an inflection in international activity, a consolidation of short-cycle activity and a return of advantaged offshore plays, all playing to our core strength. 
In particular, we are increasingly optimistic about the international growth trajectory during the second half of the year, which absent of a setback in pandemic recovery, will result in full year international growth. As a consequence, we have reinforced our confidence in our 2021 financial targets on margin expansion and free cash flow generation. 
Second, we are convinced that our performance strategy is aligned with the new industry landscape and is increasingly resonating for our customers as performance matters critically in this environment. This is translating into market wins, Middle East and offshore basins, and we support our ambition to outperform through the cycle. In addition, the steady progress in our digital strategy will translate over time in expanding new revenue streams and accretive margins. 
Third, the margin expansion realized this quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year, is reflecting the impact of both our capital search and the restructuring program and will translate into substantial operating leverage as the year progress and activity strengthened in all basins. We anticipate the upcoming quarters to further this margin expansion, with broad contribution from our basin and divisions. 
Finally, our commitment towards both sustainability and new energy is materializing in a growing portfolio of technology and ventures that will contribute to the global climate actions and to the future of the company. Ladies and gentlemen, this year represents a unique opportunity for the new Schlumberger to execute on its new performance journey and outperform the market within an increasingly attractive outlook.

Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our first quarter results, our progress on our performance strategy, and finally, our outlook for the second quarter and second half of the year. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions.  
The first quarter of 2021 was a strong step forward. The quarter unfolded as we anticipated, with acceleration in North America activity and momentum continuing to build in the international market, aside from the usual seasonal effects. We executed very well within that context. We expanded our global operating margins for the third consecutive quarter, and free cash flow was once again solidly positive.  
Here are some highlights in support of this performance. Well Construction sustained growth sequentially, and in North America, outpaced U.S. land rig count, demonstrating enhanced market participation in the recovery. Reservoir Performance grew when adjusted for the OneStim divestiture. Digital & Integration delivered another strong quarter with resilient margins on track for our full year target. In North America, execution of our returns-focused strategy drove strong margin expansion, fully aligned with our double-digit margin targets. And in international markets, despite severe seasonality and relative exposure in Russia and China, we continue to grow across geographies.  
In this environment, as the industry prepares for an upcycle, performance matters, and decision on contract awards and capacity allocation are increasingly driven by technology and execution. We are very pleased with the outcome of several international multiyear contract awards, specifically in Middle East and in offshore, building a pipeline that will support growth in 2022 and beyond.  
We are determined to drive performance differentiation, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and digital capabilities. This combination benefited our integration performance, with our largest LSTK operations achieving a 6% improvement in drilling efficiency during the quarter. This strong start of the year, characterized by resilient revenue, sequential margin expansion and positive free cash flow position us very well to meet our full year financial ambitions and to deleverage our balance sheet. I want to congratulate the entire Schlumberger team, who delivered strong execution for our customers, having positioned us for the growth that is now underway.  
Next, I would like to comment on 3 elements of our performance strategy that present further opportunity for growth in this upcoming cycle and beyond: digital, sustainability and Schlumberger New Energy. Starting with digital. 18 months ago, we stated our ambition to lead the digital transformation in our industry and to significantly grow new digital revenue streams. I want today to update you with our progress.  
Our digital strategy is a platform strategy, leveraging unique and open platforms, DELFI, OSDU and Agora. Since launching our core DELFI platform, we have significantly expanded its market reach from Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure, and more recently, using IBM-Red Hat technology to enable hybrid cloud and offer fit-for-basin cloud solutions, as highlighted this morning in our collaboration with Yandex.  
We'll continue to execute on this platform journey to expand the choice for our customers and to support our 3 digital business streams: workflow, data and operations. 
First, we offer our customers the opportunity to transition their technical workflows, from the desktop to the cloud, to realize productivity gains from DELFI workflow integration, collaboration and access to scalable cloud computing. 
Our market leadership on the desktop position us very well to capture this market. In the last 18 months, our customers have increasingly transitioned to the cloud, resulting in 50% growth of our contract backlog and a tenfold increase in full-time DELFI users. As we expand our cloud-native application and enable additional workflow within DELFI, we expect increased adoption across our customer base, resulting in steady growth of our digital workflow revenue.  
Second, recognizing that data is the key to unlock the industry digital transformation, we worked with the industry OSDU Forum to open source and contribute the underlying DELFI data ecosystem, helping to establish OSDU as the industry standard, an essential step to liberate data at scale for AI applications and to enable multivendor interoperable workflows. In this context, we recently partnered with Microsoft to offer Azure customer access to our OSDU enterprise data management solution. We will augment this offering with additional AI capabilities and will also expand our geographical reach. The market potential for this data business stream is very significant as it underpins every customer digital transformation, as exemplified by our recent announcement with Equinor.  
Third, our customer operations represent a unique opportunity to realize the promise of asset and field digital solution. We designed an open IoT platform, Agora, to enable edge applications, complementing our DELFI platform operational workflows and integrating with our partner, Sensia. Using Agora and DELFI, we are deploying digital operation solutions for drilling and production, both with our customers and as part of our integrated projects. This digital offering can significantly impact our own operations, as was demonstrated this quarter in the Ecuador project and in our main LSTK operations and also greatly benefit our customers. Our ambition is to establish critical market share in this white space and accelerate collaboration with industry partners to further its adoption.  
These 3 digital business streams, workflow, data and operation, built on open platform are supporting our digital growth ambition. We are very pleased with the progress on our platform foundation with the adoption by a broad set of customers and are confident in the success of each business stream as we execute our road maps.  
Moving now to sustainability. We are strengthening our commitment to action, particularly as the industry face a decarbonization mandate and world leaders have reaffirmed commitments or advanced stronger goals in recent days. As it relates to climate action, this goes beyond reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions, as we believe there is a significant opportunity for our technology and operating practice to decisively impact and accelerate the industry's decarbonization effort, as well as contribute towards emission reduction goals around the world.  
Our technology portfolio includes solutions that help our customers eliminate flaring, reduce fugitive methane emissions and leverage automation and digital surveillance to reduce environmental impact. This technology focus on low-carbon impact will be an increasing element of differentiation for Schlumberger in the future.  
An example that resonates with our customer is the complete electrification of offshore production systems, as outlined in our earnings release with the BP project for subsea electrification. This is the next offshore frontier, and it will also pave the way to full digital enablement.  
Beyond our industry, our CCS partnership with LafargeHolcim and the bioenergy CCS project in Mendota, California are examples of cross-sectors initiatives aligned with climate actions. 
Specifically, in Schlumberger New Energy, we reached milestones in the sector where we are participating across the energy transition: hydrogen, lithium, CCS, geothermal and geo-energy. During the quarter, we established and accelerated new ventures, formed strategic partnerships and gained market exposure and are progressing in derisking technology for upscaling.  
We'll continue to build out the New Energy portfolio throughout the year, and we will keep you updated on our progress. We are extremely proud of the tangible results we have realized in only a short time as it clearly outlines the power of the Schlumberger brand and the potential of this new chapter for the future of the company.  
Turning to the outlook. Upward revisions in global economic forecast, growth forecast by the IMF and positive demand forecast adjustment by both IEA and OPEC reinforce the transition into a demand-led recovery, which will strengthen through the second half of 2021, absent new setbacks in vaccination rollouts or easing of lockdown. 
Against this backdrop, we are increasingly confident in our full year activity outlook.  
In North America, in the second quarter, we see sustained activity growth in U.S. land and the seasonal rebound of North America offshore being partially offset by the Canada breakup. As our first quarter results have shown, particularly in Well Construction, our new mix and sizable exposure in the North America market will increasingly contribute to our results.  
Moving to international markets. Activity growth will broaden in the second quarter with the seasonal recovery in Russia and China, augmenting continued growth in Africa and the Middle East, while Latin America should remain resilient. In addition, the offshore recovery will continue in the second quarter, including the gradual return of exploration and appraisal in key international markets.  
The depth and diversity of our international franchise give us a great exposure to this market expansion, especially in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, which will lead in the second quarter. 
More broadly, we anticipate all divisions to grow sequentially at different pace and margin expansion to be led again by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction.  
In light of this, directionally, we expect total second quarter revenue to grow in mid-single digits and our operating margins to further expand by 50 to 100 basis points.  
Looking farther into the second half of 2021. In North America, the pace of growth is expected to moderate on budget exhaustion and seasonal effect but could surprise to the upside, resulting in full year growth when excluding the impact of divestiture. 
In the international markets, our confidence in the second half outlook has been strengthening based on the latest international rig count trends, CapEx signal and customer engagements. International activity will broaden and accelerate in the second half, impacting short to long cycle, both on land and offshore, including the productivity in the most advantaged offshore basins.  
The magnitude of these leading indicators, combined with upward revisions to global economic growth and demand recovery, present the potential from -- for an even stronger inflection than initially anticipated for the second half of the year. Therefore, we have greater confidence in the previous guidance of a double-digit increase in international revenue in the second half when compared to the same period last year. And absent of a setback in a post-economic -- post-pandemic recovery, we foresee an upside for full year growth internationally, resulting in a stronger footing as we enter 2022.  
In the context of this top line growth and the steps we took to reset the earnings power, we are confident that we will fully realize our operating leverage to deliver our full year ambition of 250 to 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year. We expect to continue expanding during -- margins during the recovery to support increasing cash flow throughout the year, which should provide subsequent deleveraging opportunities. 
Now I would like to pass the call to Stephane."

First quarter earnings per share was $0.21. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this re",898,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share was $0.21. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this represents a decrease of $0.01 sequentially and $0.04 when compared to the first quarter of last year.  
Overall, our first quarter revenue of $5.2 billion decreased approximately 6% sequentially. However, if we adjust for the OneStim and artificial lift low-flow divestitures, which were completed during the fourth quarter of last year, revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite the first quarter seasonality. 
Excluding the impact of divestitures, North America revenue increased 10% sequentially, reflecting a significant activity increase on land, partially offset by lower product sales offshore.  
International revenue declined only 3% sequentially despite the effects of the extended winter period we experienced in Russia and the usual seasonality in the Far East. 
Pretax operating margins were 12.7% and have now increased for 3 quarters in a row. In addition, pretax operating margins were 230 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. This represents the highest margin since the third quarter of 2019. This strong margin performance reflects the significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost-out program, which is now essentially complete.  
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.1% for the first quarter were flat sequentially as the positive impact of the OneStim divestiture was offset by the seasonal effects we typically experience in the first quarter. EBITDA margins were 203 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year.  
Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $773 million decreased 7% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower sales of digital solutions and multiclient licenses. Margins only decreased by 37 basis points to 32% as the effects of the digital solutions and multiclient revenue declines were largely offset by improved profitability from APS projects.  
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1 billion decreased 20% sequentially. However, excluding the impact of the divested OneStim business, revenue increased 3%, despite seasonally lower revenue in Russia and China. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East.  
Margins increased 260 (sic) [ 261 ] basis points to 10.2%, largely due to the divestiture of the OneStim business that was dilutive to the division's fourth quarter margins. 
Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 4% sequentially, and margins increased 103 basis points to 10.8% due to increased activity in North America land and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in drilling activity in Russia and China.  
Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% sequentially. International revenue declined 4%, while North America was down 3%. 
Despite the revenue decline, margins only decreased 71 basis points to 8.7% as a result of cost measures as well as improved profitability in midstream production systems due to higher activity.  
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $429 million of cash flow from operations and positive free cash flow of $159 million, despite severance payments of $112 million and the increase in working capital requirements we always experienced in the first quarter due to the annual payout of employee incentives. Our cash flow will improve throughout the rest of the year, consistent with our historical quarterly trends.  
Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.7 billion, a decrease of $207 million when compared to the end of the previous quarter. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $270 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments.  
On that note, let me take the opportunity to provide you with a quick update on our capital stewardship program. Optimizing the allocation of our capital investments will be critical to maximize the benefits of the ongoing activity recovery, which is poised to accelerate in the next few quarters. As part of the company's reorganization, we implemented a new capital allocation framework that governs all types of investments. The underlying principle behind the framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow before any other metric.  
At the corporate level, this framework allows us to critically assess our technology portfolio and rationalize our offering to reduce capital intensity and maximize returns. At the division level, we have strengthened our processes to ensure that new assets, as well as existing assets, are deployed where they will generate the highest returns. We are also leveraging this capital discipline to drive commercial behaviors and improve the quality of our revenue.  
With this in place, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit cash flow margin -- free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to deleverage the balance sheet, which remains a top priority for us. 
It is worth noting that during the quarter, the 2 major credit rating agencies confirmed our long-term credit ratings of A2 and A, respectively. And both cited our expected strong cash flow profile and our commitment to deleveraging. 
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

I think, first, I think -- I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by",389,"No. Thank you, James. I think, first, I think -- I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by or before the end of 2022. In this context, I believe that we are ready and starting at, and during the second half of this year, facing the beginning of a demand-led recovery that will trigger a multiyear recovery cycle and industry upcycle. 
In this context, if you look at the recent period of underinvestment, look at the structural constraints in North America due to capital discipline, I believe that this will create the condition to create a significant pool on international supply. So this will support international supply activity buildup, not only at the end of this year, but well into '22 and '23. 
In addition to this, I believe that the offshore, being a unique market, a privileged market for IOCs, some NOCs and focused independents will also see a gradual but very strong recovery over the long term. It is -- the offshore advantaged basins represents extremely good oil production plateau for some basins at low carbon footprint, so this will support also the long-term international recovery. 
So we believe really that we are very well positioned to outperform in this macro because we believe that this macro outlook that would include a growing international mix, including offshore, will play very well to our strength. In addition, we have accelerated our strategy transformation, both the organizational transformation and key strategic elements that will place very well from efficiency performance focus from our capital stewardship, our fit-for-basin that is resonating very well for our customer, and finally, for our digital and decarbonization strategic focus we are putting. 
So I believe that we are seeing the beginning of this multiyear growth. We are also seeing that our performance strategy is resonating very well for customers, and we have been awarded several multiyear contract that is -- that are creating the backlog we need to support this growth going forward. So yes, I'm optimistic not only on the second half of this year but on an accelerated path in 2022 and the long cycle strength, including offshore, in '22, '23 and beyond."

First, I think is the -- as I described, is the very favorable macro outlook that combined the pace of international growth, the offshore element and also, as we are saying to see this quarter, the return of exploration and appraisal activity that is still needed to replenish the reserve and also that is becoming more near fleet exploration close to the offshore hubs in particular. So these factors are very favorable. 
Secondly, I believe that we have created quality revenue initiatives as part of our initiatives. First, fit-for-basin. Fit-for-basin technology is creating the premium that differentiate us in some critical basin, in some critical assets and give us the premium for revenue quality improvement. Similarly, I think our technology access, as we have seen in North America, has played a great role in helping us to expand market but also to command premium with our technology partner. And finally, the success of digital will be accretive over the period to this. 
So the third element, I think, beyond this strategy, I think, is the step change we expect to materialize into our integration contracts. From a performance efficiency using digital, as we have demonstrated already, using fit technology and using practice that are becoming best-in-class. So we believe that these 3 elements, the backdrop, the key element of our strategy for revenue quality and the enhanced margin on our integrated contract will all combine to create a condition for further margin expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion going forward."

In Saudi, I think it's more related to performance and activity share awards that resulted from our performance in execution in the quarter. 
And I think we see this factor of a strong market position we have, of performance differentiation to help us go forward. So that's to maybe support and substantiate what we see going forward. In addition to this, as you have seen from last quarter to this quarter, we did announce some critical awards that are securing or expanding this market position in Middle East. 
Now there is a lot of LSTK and some of our peers have talked about large and very large contract tenders underway, so I cannot and will not comment on these as these tenders are underway. But what I can say is that the activity is rebounding, the activity outlook, both land and offshore in Middle East, is and will be strengthening. So our customers are indeed securing capacity and looking for best performer and looking for, in a sense, the condition that will make them successful in their ambition to augment their capacity and augment their production going forward.

It was interesting to hear you talk about the 3 elements of the workflow, data and operations. So I'm just wondering if you could just maybe expand a bit on how you see each the pace of growth in each of those and what is that dependent upon.
Partly I'm wondering, is the customers just getting more comfortable in using digital and day-to-day operations? But do you also need to build out new software applications or maybe it's just something else?"

So first, there has been a catalyst in the last 18 months that accelerated adoption of digital. That's the first. 
We believe that our platform strategy is being recognized, accepted and across different customer type from national company to independent to the IOCs. As you have seen, there is a large adoption of this because we have kept this platform open. Now when it comes to the pace and growth factor that differentiates workflow, data and operation, I believe that workflow is the one that is the most mature because it builds on our existing desktop market leadership we have. And here, we are transitioning the existing customer base we have towards the cloud. 
And each of them is realizing the power of the cloud from productivity, from collaboration, from access to scalable cloud computing, we simply need to reassure them that our platform is open and that they can make the choice, their choice on the cloud infrastructure, which we are doing. 
The second data, I think, is renaissance of the data market that used to be a major market in digital 20 years ago. Everybody realized that without the data, we cannot unlock the power of digital transformation. So thankfully, the industry has come together and has created this OSDU platform, Open Subsurface Data Universe, driven by the open forum, and we have been fortunate to technically contribute our DELFI ecosystem to this. So on that foundation, every company will have to roll out and will certainly use the opportunity to roll out OSDU as a platform so that it unlocks the data access, liberate the data and then data provider and then service provider, a consulting company and the customer themselves will tap into this data using AI application, and this is where we want to participate, both the data transition to this new platform and the AI opportunity upon this. 
Finally, operation. Operation is the biggest price long term but also the most difficult to realize because every asset, every infrastructure on the field, every infrastructure at the edge is different. So while we believe that there is an immense opportunity to use digital in operation, and we are doing it very successfully internally, the complexity, the system integration needs and the fit-for-purpose digital deployment will slow down on the adoption of this. Yet we'll make progress and we'll continue to partner with other companies to make sure that we offer integrated offering to the industry. 
When you combine these 3 at the different pace of growth, you create the condition for multiplicity of revenue stream that will support our double digital ambition that we'll realize within the decade."

And the way we decided to go after this is to first identify and selectively the domain in which we believe we can leverage our strength. The subsurface can leverage our strengths, our technology and global footprint to create and forge partnership, technology, acquisition or organically grow the domain. 
So first, we have decided to explore and establish market position and diversify our market entrants into this domain. So you have seen that we have, in parallel, from lithium to CCS, from hydrogen to geo-energy and geothermal credit venture, each of them with potentially a different partner for addressing a different industry sector, so that we diversify not only our approach but diversify and expand our market reach. So that has been the first, is to make sure that we diversify our investments, diversify our market approach and our type of partnership. So that has been our first, I would say, framework that we have used to develop this. 
Now what is our ambition there? Ambition is to create the future of the company in the long run. So within the decade and within the next 2 or 3 years, specifically, we will derisk at scale this technology investment, these venture investments, working with our partners, working internally to develop those technology as we are for green hydrogen, as we will with our CCS Mendota bioenergy plant or with LafargeHolcim for CCS and cement plant. We will work, develop, embark into venture where we will derisk, enhance, and then when it is derisked at scale, will then make bigger investments, large investments that will then support the long-term growth."

And that's our approach. 
Now whether the capacity -- global capacity will create, in a short term, global pricing, I don't think it will but I think it will, certainly in the coming quarters, create pricing inflection on some business lines in some basins.

So free cash flow will improve quarter after quarter like it has in the past and we will deliver that ambition. 
It can be enhanced by exceptional proceeds. We are continuously looking at our portfolio, as I mentioned earlier. We are particularly working on 2 key divestitures: one is I mentioned in the previous quarter in regards to our APS portfolio. We are looking at launching very soon in the next few days, actually, a formal process for the APS asset in Canada. There's a lot of interest still and the economics have improved quite a bit. So we are quite hopeful there to close a good transaction. 
And the second one is the rigs we have in the Middle East. We are actually even more advanced there. We are in a formal process. We have shortlisted a few interested buyers and they are just concluding the due diligence. So we should be closing or at least signing, sorry, this transaction in the next few months. So this will enhance the cash flow profile and the potential reduction of our net debt and the flexibility it will give on liquidity basically."

I think, first, it's worth saying that offshore basins and the most advantaged offshore basins are still very much very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, IOCs, some unique NOCs and a few independents t",351,"That's a great question. I think, first, it's worth saying that offshore basins and the most advantaged offshore basins are still very much very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, IOCs, some unique NOCs and a few independents that are pure-play offshore independents from relative medium to large size. So first, this resource are precious. This resource typically have a good geology. And as I said, both from the production plateau, they provide and/or the low-carbon opportunity they have in terms of mix of API grade, I think this excellent resource. 
The second thing I believe is that the economics for offshore due to integration success, feed technology and digital practice have improved from the last cycle. And I think opportunity exists for the industry to leverage this and accelerate some FID going forward. 
So another factor that is very critical as you touch the exploration appraisal is that most of the major and large NOC on this -- in this context are recognizing the impact of exploiting hubs, offshore hubs. And the offshore hubs, the opportunity is to exploit those hubs to improve the return on asset, improve return on infrastructure and focus on near-field or backyard exploration so that they maximize the return on existing infrastructure, existing FPSO, existing platform, so that it is also something that plays very well in our portfolio for infield drilling or for subsea tieback as we are expanding in this domain. 
So I believe that the exploration appraisal will not necessarily accelerate in frontier exploration but will accelerate in near-field exploration offshore, and we're starting to see this, this quarter and will accelerate during the second half of the year. So I'm optimistic indeed on offshore. And if you read some of the restarts or IHS reports or some of the report highlighting the FID pipeline, you see that the FID pipeline that are pre-committed towards '22, '23 have the potential over '22, '23 and beyond to eclipse the last 2017, 2019 in terms of number of projects but also in terms of total CapEx invested in deepwater."

I think first, the production system, I think, is not only subsea system as both short and long cycle as exposure in short cycle in North America to the ESP, which is coming back strongly, and the Cameron Surface equipment also servicing the frac and our partner, Liberty. And also -- and internationally, it's indeed a mix of short for ASP and some completion equipment and long cycle for midstream as well as for subsea and surface equipment. 
So it's a mix of long and short with very tangible exposure in North America, benefiting in short term and long term international long cycle, both recovery and production new projects. In that context and back to the point on offshore, I believe that the subsea market is very alive. And I think last year, the number of subsidiaries were short of 200 compared to higher than 50 in 2019. The prediction this year is to be above 200. 220 is our prediction and is aligned with the market prediction. And this will be more or less increasing going forward gradually to be within between 250 to 300 over the midterm period to support this offshore project."

The second is that we are still on track, okay, and very confident on our 250 to 300 full year --300 bps full year margin expansion. So in the second quarter, indeed, there are 2 factors: one is the fact that you are mobilizing for what the offshore return and some of the activity that are prepping and mobilizing for the second half already in the later part of the quarter. But also there are some persistent but temporary COVID-related constraints and cost that as the lockdown are still in place in many countries, that adding cost upfront into those mobilization and making this mobilization cost maybe a little bit more than they would have been in other cycle the past. So these are the factors that are shaping up, but we are very confident that the margin expansion is in place and will continue going forward."

Thank you very much. So thank you, and to conclude, I would like to offer 3 takeaway: first, the macroeconomic and activity outlook are increasingly supporting an attractive industry upcycle, characterized with an inflection in international activity, a consolidation of short-cycle activity and a return of advantaged offshore plays, all playing to our core strength. 
In particular, we are increasingly optimistic about the international growth trajectory during the second half of the year, which absent of a setback in pandemic recovery, will result in full year international growth. As a consequence, we have reinforced our confidence in our 2021 financial targets on margin expansion and free cash flow generation. 
Second, we are convinced that our performance strategy is aligned with the new industry landscape and is increasingly resonating for our customers as performance matters critically in this environment. This is translating into market wins, partly in Middle East and offshore basins, and we support our ambition to outperform through the cycle. In addition, the steady progress in our digital strategy will translate over time in expanding new revenue streams and accretive margins. 
Third, the margin expansion realized this quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year, is reflecting the impact of both our capital search and the restructuring program and will translate into substantial operating leverage as the year progress and activity strengthened in all basins. We anticipate the upcoming quarters to further this margin expansion, with broad contribution from our basin and divisions. 
Finally, our commitment towards both sustainability and New Energy is materializing in a growing portfolio of technology and ventures that will contribute to the global climate actions and to the future of the company. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this year represents a unique opportunity for the new Schlumberger to execute on its new performance journey and outperform the market within an increasingly attractive outlook. Thank you very much."

Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our second quarter results, the near-term industry macro environment and the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Finally, I will share my perspective on how Schlumberger's position for sustained outperformance in this macro context. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. 
Our second quarter results demonstrate very broad strength in our core portfolio as we continue to fully capitalize on the short- and long-cycle activity recovery across divisions, operating environments and geographies, both in North America and internationally. The combination of revenue quality, solid execution and vastly improved operating leverage delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. 
Let me share with you some performance highlights during the quarter. 
Internationally, the depth and diversity of our portfolio enables us to take hold of the recovery in the second quarter, restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels, ahead of the anticipated acceleration in these markets. In North America, we achieved our double-digit margin ambition, a key milestone in our 2021 financial targets. All divisions fully leverage the activity recovery to post sequential top line growth and significant margin expansion, including production systems, which reached double-digit margins during the quarter. 
Growth and margin expansion were led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, both posting growth internationally and in North America. Our performance growth was driven by the exploration and seasonal recovery, higher offshore activity and new technology adoption, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion in excess of 270 basis points. Well Construction accelerated its rate of growth sequentially, outpacing rig count growth both in North America and internationally, with strong contribution from offshore basins. 
In U.S. land, the dividend grew more than 30%, double the sequential rig count growth rate over the quarter. This does not only reflect enhanced market participation, but also improving revenue quality. 
And cash flow finally from operation was $1.2 billion, enabling us to begin deleveraging the balance sheet this quarter. 
In addition to the impact of operating leverage, there were 2 contributing factors to this financial outperformance: first, the offshore activity mix; and second, technology adoption. The offshore rebound in the second quarter was led by high single-digit deepwater activity growth, partly in Brazil, and also included a mid-teens growth in exploration and appraisal activity across Europe and the Middle East. This market condition presented a favorable mix and resulted in higher revenue quality for both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. 
In addition, as customers commit to future offshore development activity, we received significant deepwater awards for our OneSubsea business line, resulting in a doubling of the booking volume versus the prior quarter and a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.5. 
The other contributing factor is increasing new technology uptake. The rate of adoption of our latest generation technology increased by 1/3 during the quarter and included, in particular, Transition Technologies, digital and fit-for-basin solutions, which benefited all divisions and most basins. This is a clear recognition of the performance impact our technologies generate for our customers, and it gives us increased confidence in the contribution of technology adoption towards margin expansion in this up cycle. 
In addition, we continue to advance our digital and New Energy strategies. -- extending the reach of our digital platform with a number of key agreements and awards as customers forge ahead with their digital transformations. And in New Energy, we continue to progress all of our ventures, including the recently announced strategic collaboration with Panasonic North America to develop our new battery-grade lithium production process in Clayton Valley, Nevada. 
Finally, during the second quarter, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero clean house emissions by 2050. I'm very proud to lead the first service company that have set net zero ambition that includes Scope 3 emissions. We have laid out an approach to climate change that is science-based aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius target of the Paris agreement and is built on a comprehensive near-term road map to achieve our goal with interim milestones in 2025 and 2030. 
As a company that prides itself on technology innovation, we aim to net the balance of emission we produce in 2050 with carbon negative action. 
These plans also include the launch of our Transition Technologies portfolio to support our customers on their journeys to net zero such as the avoidance of flaring with Ora wireline technology and the track record of CYNARA membrane separation technology, as you have seen in this morning's release. 
Our net zero ambition and the launch of Transitions Technology is an opportunity to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry, building true innovation, a resilient future that delivers higher carbon, higher value and lower carbon. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our revenue quality, solid execution, enhanced market participation, both North America and internationally, and most importantly, the translation of all of these elements into another successive quarter of margin expansion. 
I want to thank here the entire Schlumberger team as they continue to execute and deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our communities despite COVID impact in several parts of the world. 
Next, I would like to share my view on the macroeconomic environment supporting our industry. While the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant and resurgence of related disruption could impact the pace of economic opening, recent market projections continue to affirm an improving global economic outlook. 
Global GDP growth is now expected to approach 6% in 2021 and more than 4% in 2022, which should continue to drive a progressive recovery of oil demand. This outlook is supported by recent oil demand updates, which reflect the anticipation of wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improved mobility and additional fiscal stimulus in large economies through the second half of the year. 
Looking further out, the IEA projects that global oil demand will reach 100 million barrels per day and surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 in the absence of further policy change. 
With oil price at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle project, reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore development and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter. 
In North America, this supply response is reflected in the rig count and factory trends, which sustained strong growth through the first half of the year. Private operator-led activity growth which resulted from the acceleration of DUC completion and increased drilling activity to replenish DUC inventory. By contrast, the embrace of capital discipline by the public operators is highlighted by the rig count still being significantly below the Q1 2020 total despite WTI price exceeding pre-pandemic levels. 
In this context, despite a solid activity growth outlook, we maintain our view that the North American market will be structurally smaller than in previous cycle as a consequence of capital discipline and industry consolidation. 
Moving to international markets. The deficit of investment needed to deliver the required oil supply represent a sustained growth opportunity, particularly in the low-cost advantage basis. We remain constructive on a structural pool on international supply and the resulting activity impact. This was already visible in the second quarter with a strong seasonal rebound and offshore recovery despite the impact of COVID disruption in part of Asia and in the Middle East. This also marked the second consecutive quarter of international rig count growth. 
Looking further out, we see favorable conditions for durable investment growth driven by the combination of actions by NOCs, internationally focused investment by public E&P operators and the expectation of continued supply discipline by OPEC+, all in response to the steady evolution of demand. The current pace of international tendering contract awards and increasing book-to-bill ratio support this view. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger is extremely well positioned, both in international markets and in North America. Our market exposure is biased to equity growth. And with the sale of new contract wins, our leading digital and fit-for-basin technology portfolio and our performance strategy, we will create value for our customers and deliver industry-leading returns. 
Turning to the third quarter outlook. In North America, we see another quarter of growth, albeit somewhat moderating in U.S. land, led by private operators and horizontal oil drilling and a seasonal recovery in Canada. North America offshore will remain resilient, albeit with the hurricane season in view. 
Moving to the international markets. Positive growth momentum is expected to continue through the third quarter across all areas.  Short-cycle activity will be augmented by longer-cycle project start-up. 
In this context, directionally, we expect our global third quarter revenue to grow by mid-single digits led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction divisions, while our pretax segment operating margin should further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. 
With this outlook for the third quarter, we remain confident in achieving double-digit international growth in the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. As a consequence, and absent further COVID setback in operational recovery, we now foresee full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America, when excluding the impact of divestiture. 
With activity recovery ahead of us through the third quarter and strong signal of a durable recovery beyond that, we can now clearly see a path to the other hand of our full year EBITDA margin expansion guidance for 2021. 
Looking further ahead, the fundamentals remain very favorable, with a growing economic rebound, supportive oil prices and the demand and superb outlook all representing a set of unique conditions that will support an exceptional growth cycle. Furthermore, this cycle will be broad-based across geographies and operational environment, land, offshore, North America and particularly, international markets. The second quarter was a strong indication of the future outlook and a testament of our restored earnings power under these conditions. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong quarter second quarter results across our entire portfolio, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in delivering our long-term financial ambition. 
I will now pass the call to Stephane."

Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year",775,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year, excluding charges. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first or second quarter of 2021. 
Overall, our second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion increased 8% sequentially. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially, while international revenue increased 7%, both outpacing respective rig count growth. 
Pretax operating margins were 14.3%, and have now increased 4 quarters in a row. This represents the highest margin since the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, margins expanded sequentially across all 4 divisions. This performance was driven not only by the seasonal rebound in the Northern hemisphere, but also a favorable revenue mix as a result of increased offshore activity, new technology adoption and increased exploration and appraisal activity. 
Company-wide, adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% for the second quarter increased 118 basis points sequentially and is the highest since the third quarter of 2018. I am very pleased with this margin performance, which reflects the benefit of significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high grading of our portfolio and our cost reduction program. This performance also gives me the confidence that we will continue to increase margins in the third quarter and beyond. 
Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. 
Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $817 million, increased 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 147 basis points to 33%. These increases were primarily driven by strong digital solution sales. 
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.1 billion increased 12% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity, which resulted in international revenue increasing by 13%. Margins expanded 373 basis points to 13.9%, largely due to the seasonal recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and increased offshore and exploration activity as well as favorable technology mix in the Middle East and Africa. 
Well Construction revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins increased 209 basis points to 12.9%. These improvements were driven by strong performance both in North America and internationally. U.S. land revenue grew by over 30%, significantly outpacing the increase in rig count. International activity increased beyond the seasonal rebound as many countries experienced double-digit revenue growth. 
Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially, and margins increased 146 basis points to 10.2%. These decreases were primarily driven by higher activity in Europe, Africa and North America. 
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $869 million despite severance payments of $72 million. The amounts included the receipt of $477 million U.S. federal tax refund relating to prior years. This refund helped support our deleveraging efforts during the quarter. In this regard, our gross debt decreased by $861 million during the quarter. We have begun to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as demonstrated by the early redemption in June of all $665 million of notes that were coming due in September. We also repaid $236 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Net debt decreased sequentially by $632 million to $13 billion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. 
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $351 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. 
In total, during the first half of 2021, we generated over $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and over $1 billion of free cash flow. These amounts are fully expected to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with historical trends. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to continue to deleverage the balance sheet and provide us with flexibility in our capital allocation. 
One last item worth highlighting is that during the quarter, we replaced our EUR 750 million credit facility with a new 3-year EUR 750 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The terms of this facility are aligned with the interim emissions reduction targets disclosed as part of our net 0 emissions commitment announced this quarter.

I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors that I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion. So",393,"Yes. Thanks, James. You are correct. I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors that I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion. 
So first and foremost, I think the performance was led by revenue expansion, revenue growth. I think our revenue growth has worked out to be at or ahead of our expectation, both internationally and in North America. I think credit to our team, credit to the customer centricity, the new organization and our performance. 
Secondly, I think the -- we have seen a significant effect of our operating leverage as well as operational efficiency playing in full light during the quarter, and we expect this to be the base of our margin expansion for the quarters to come. So this was in full display in all divisions and has led to this significant margin expansion, particularly in the service-led Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. 
Thirdly, the revenue quality, as I recall it, was led by activity -- favorable activity mix coming from the seasonal rebound in some basins, some regions. And that included an offshore mix that was favorable to those 2 division as well, as well as an exploration appraisal uptick, mid-teens exploration appraisal offshore quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter. So when you combine this, this is representing a revenue mix quality that I think is unique. This was supplemented by technology adoption. 
Digital options linked to our fit-for-basin solution for customers that are seeing success. Digital, as you heard during the remarks prepared by Stephane, and likely the new technology Transition Technologies portfolio, a combination of which is creating revenue quality that is then impacting favorably our margin. 
Lastly, and this was only not noticeable in North America, we had a couple of green shots on pricing, and Well construction also starting to be recognized. 
So project this forward I think the seasonal rebound will not always be there every quarter. The unique exploration appraisal uptick mix that we got also will not repeat. But you can count on us to leverage the future growth in industry, both in North America and internationally to see the operating leverage and operating efficiency we have, the favorable mix and the technology adoption that should fuel our margin expansion going forward."

First, progress on our platform strategy.

And I think we have made much progress there, and I think we are in the eighth or the ninth inning, if you like, on the platform readiness for full scalability and expansion. And we made progress on the adoption of DELFI as you have seen some announcements, and we continue to progress on rolling out for the client that have already adopted DELFI, Hence, our revenue on the DELFI and a new technology of digital was significantly accretive to our growth, significantly accretive to D&I and result into margin expansion flow-through that was visible this quarter. 
So that will not continue the same every quarter. It depends on the seasonality and on the specific, but expect the directionally to continue to grow."

Now in the context of the Middle East, in partic",354,"Yes. First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on 
the second quarter growth. It was always seems all divisions internationally said, it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East, in particular, the growth was maybe more muted or less aggressive and less accretive to the overall growth than other basins. And there are a couple of reasons for that. 
And the first and foremost reason is relating to the supply constraints that are still outstanding on the back and as such, muting some of the short cycle activity that we could have expected to rebound faster. So now going forward, there are a couple of factors that will play favorably short term and midterm. 
Short term, there will be a relief of some of the supply constraints that will continue to inch up the short-cycle activity, including in Saudi. There is a commitment in Middle East for gas development. And I think Qatar was the first to expand their commitment, and we have benefited greatly from that rebound in activity for the last couple of quarters, and this will extend also to a couple of our country, including Saudi. 
And lastly, as we turn into 2022, you have heard some signal from a couple of countries in GCC that have signaled that they will commit to production capacity increase to fulfill their opportunity to gain share as there will be a pull on international supply. So this will result from 2022 in combination of short-cycle-gas development and long cycle across that region. And hence, they will catch up, and they will certainly be a region that will lead the activity growth and will support in second half double-digit year-on-year H2 and next year into a strong growth going forward. 
Finally, if I have to make a comment on this, I think you may have seen some contract wins and contract award in Middle East. And we believe that on top of this activity growth, we have the potential to outperform and then getting a further tailwind to our growth going forward."

We see that the contract wins and the market position we have will benefit us to pull from this additional growth going forward. And the operational leverage, the activity mix in clean offshore and the technology adoption in doing digital will all create the condition, as I commented earlier, to expand our margins.

Now with our strong cash flow performance and the EBITDA expansion, we are quite confident that we can achieve this target sometime by the end of 2022. 
Now we will, of course, need to continue investing in our core business to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle, but this will be done with the same discipline we are exercising today and within the target range of 5% to 7% for the operating part of our CapEx, i.e., excluding APS and multiclient. 
So accounting for this, however, we will still generate significant excess cash flow throughout the growth cycle. This is, of course, very good news. It gives us optionality in our capital allocation, particularly to execute our strategy and to fund our new horizons of growth. 
Now whether it relates to our core portfolio or expansion into digital or New Energy, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework.

First and foremost, performance in the way we execute, and I think has led to you from cementing to drilling, directional drilling [indiscernible] market share gain with both private and with operators, public operators in the U.S. 
The second factor is that, as you remember, as part of our North America strategy pivot we did initiate 2 years ago, we accelerated our technology access giving access of fit-for-basin technology to some local DD company that are then using renting or buying equipment and using it to serve their local customers, mostly, if not exclusively, private. So this has been growing and quarter-on-quarter, and this is helping us to reach market and expand our market share beyond what we could do to our service arm. 
And finally, as I mentioned in my -- in one of my response earlier, we had some green shoots where our performance on is high demand, our directional drilling equipment was seen as unique to deliver the curve. Hence, we could extract some pricing  premium. So the combination of these 3 have delivered this 30-plus quarter-on-quarter top line delivery, far outpacing the account growth.

Going forward, and already initiated in some geographies where we had more than double-digit growth, as I mentioned, we had access to some resource that we onboarded during the quarter to respond to the contract we are winning. So the long cycle actually nature of international give us a bit more long-term visibility to this condition. Hence, our market approach is to target specific geographies and business line where we believe we can be generating accretive returns and growth and prepare for it by mobilizing ahead the resource or moving resource to address those.

On oil, you have a mix. But in short term, it's mostly a short cycle in anticipation of the supply constraint relief. And for 2 or 3 of the country that participate to the GOC, they have already made public commitments that they will expand, and they will participate at scale into the post rebalance, if you like, of the supply and then participate to the capture of international share of supply into 2023.

Let me first clarify and not mix in the same umbrella. The New Energy portfolio that we have developed with the purpose to create a new chapter beyond oil and gas [indiscernible] scaling to the energy transition from hydrogen to CCS and energy or lithium, as you have heard, from the Transition Technologies that we believe are very pertinent to the decarbonization of our oil and gas industry, helping our customers to reduce their footprint to reduce their GHG emission. And in this context, we are focusing on flaring elimination or reduction, and you are using, in particular, the Ora wireline technology to avoid returning the fruits to the surface and burn and dispose through flaring and do the reservoir characterization and testing in situ, if you like. And that's a unique technology that has significant impact on both efficiency and on the CO2 footprint for everyone using it. 
And we are looking at methane emission detection and containment. And we are looking at, as you have seen in the press release this morning also the CYNARA CO2 membrane that have superior performance for large acid gas treatment, if you want, to do CO2 detection and capture. 
So you have these 2 aspects. So the Transition Technologies will come more and more into play. And most of the customer meet asking us whether we can help them and have a conversation engagement on to methane detection, flaring or other techniques that eliminate or reduce significantly the footprint of CO2 on every operation on their Scope 3 emission, if you like, in addition to their Scope 1 direct emission. And then in the [indiscernible] that will be part of our technology growth, technology adoption in the quarters to come. 
And then longer term, we will build on our New Energy portfolio that we are building. And then once we have to build this, we will grow at scale from hydrogen to CCS and bio energy with [indiscernible] Celsius for the heating and cooling of buildings to lithium production of the pilot that we are initiating, and the contribution from Panasonic give us the opportunity to do so. So these are 2 different avenue for growth short term and long term."

I think first and foremost, I think let me highlight I think 2 different, I would say, factor that will indeed leverage our current platform. 
First is the global deployment capability we have. We can industrialize and ship technology and deploy technology anywhere in the world, and we have done so for more than 80 or 90 years. And I think our ability to create franchise in every country from technology develop or we developed locally, I think, is something that is unique, and I think that differentiates from many of the pure plays.  
The relationship we have and the customer base we have today will be occasionally, and I think will be in the sense of the CCS where our customers have the opportunity to participate or in some of the downstream operation where they have a carbon capture or blue addition opportunity would be an opportunity for us to continue to work with that customer base and expand. And at the same time, some of this company happening into integrated energy company that will also participate at scale in the same market as we do. So that relationship will be useful, but I will more, I would say, highlight the global deployment capability. 
Now when it comes to capital allocation and capital deployment, I think it's very difficult to pinpoint to you specific here. I think we will gain -- continue to mature this venture, prepare for scale as we start to, I would say, progress on milestones, progress on our partnership and progress on a business model and the supply chain model that are quite different from the one we experienced today.

Now if you look at the current production of the U.S., which is 1.5 million barrels or about below in U.S. land, below what it was in early 2020, this gap has not yet been breached. And I think I do not expect this to be breached as we exit 2022. So there will be an incremental oil supply that will pull on international market that the market can deliver today. But for sustainability in '23 and '24, the market will have to commit capacity. Hence, this is the reason why in Middle East and other country, you see this could commit part of capacity. And this is the reason why you see the return of offshore and the commitment of FID. 
We have 50 FID about already to date. We expect to be 100 FID, most of them in offshore at the end of the year. This is  50% more than it was last year, and the trajectory is towards 150 another 50% increment after that.

Second, the activity and customer trends observed during the quarter reinforce our conviction in an increasingly favorable outlook, a broad recovery across all basins and operating environment and with a much improved contribution from new technology adoption. 
Third, and absent further COVID setback impacting activity or economic rebound, we are confident that the momentum for this up cycle, both North America and internationally, will continue during the second half of 2021 and will lead to another quarter of growth and margin expansion.

Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our second quarter results, the near-term industry macro environment and the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Finally, I will share my perspective on how Schlumberger is positioned for sustained outperformance in this macro context. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions.  
Our second quarter results demonstrate very broad strength in our core portfolio as we continue to fully capitalize on the short- and long-cycle activity recovery across divisions, operating environments and geographies, both in North America and internationally. The combination of revenue quality, solid execution and vastly improved operating leverage delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion.  
Let me share with you some performance highlights during the quarter.  
Internationally, the depth and diversity of our portfolio enabled us to take hold of the recovery in the second quarter, restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels, ahead of the anticipated acceleration in these markets. In North America, we achieved our double-digit margin ambition, a key milestone in our 2021 financial targets. All divisions fully leveraged the activity recovery to post sequential top line growth and significant margin expansion, including Production Systems, which reached double-digit margins during the quarter.  
Growth and margin expansion were led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, both posting growth internationally and in North America. Reservoir Performance growth was driven by the exploration and seasonal recovery, higher offshore activity and new technology adoption, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion in excess of 370 basis points. Well Construction accelerated its rate of growth sequentially, outpacing rig count growth both in North America and internationally, with strong contribution from offshore basins.  
In U.S. land, the dividend grew more than 30%, double the sequential rig count growth rate over the quarter. This does not only reflect enhanced market participation, but also improving revenue quality. 
And cash flow, finally, from operation was $1.2 billion, enabling us to begin deleveraging the balance sheet this quarter.  
In addition to the impact of operating leverage, there were 2 contributing factors to this financial outperformance: first, the offshore activity mix; and second, technology adoption. The offshore rebound in the second quarter was led by high single-digit deepwater activity growth, partly in Brazil, and also included a mid-teens growth in exploration and appraisal activity across Europe and the Middle East. This market condition presented a favorable mix and resulted in higher revenue quality for both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction.  
In addition, as customers commit to future offshore development activity, we received significant deepwater awards for our OneSubsea business line, resulting in a doubling of the booking volume versus the prior quarter and a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.5.  
The other contributing factor is increasing new technology uptake. The rate of adoption of our latest generation technology increased by 1/3 during the quarter and included, in particular, transition technologies, digital and fit-for-basin solutions, which benefited all divisions and most basins. This is a clear recognition of the performance impact our technologies generate for our customers, and it gives us increased confidence in the contribution of technology adoption towards margin expansion in this up cycle.  
In addition, we continue to advance our digital and new energy strategies, extending the reach of our digital platform with a number of key agreements and awards as customers forge ahead with their digital transformations. And in New Energy, we continue to progress all of our ventures, including the recently announced strategic collaboration with Panasonic North America to develop our new battery-grade lithium production process in Clayton Valley, Nevada.  
Finally, during the second quarter, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. I'm very proud to lead the first service company that have set net-zero ambition that includes Scope 3 emissions. We have laid out an approach to climate change that is science-based aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement and is built on a comprehensive near-term road map to achieve our goal with interim milestones in 2025 and 2030.  
As a company that prides itself on technology innovation, we aim to net the balance of emissions we produce in 2050 with carbon-negative actions.  
These plans also includes the launch of our Transition Technologies portfolio to support our customers on their journeys to net zero, such as the avoidance of flaring with Ora wireline technology and the track record of CYNARA CO2 membrane separation technology, as you have seen in this morning's release.  
Our net-zero ambition and the launch of Transitions Technology (sic) [ Transition Technologies ] is an opportunity to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry, building through innovation, a resilient future that delivers higher carbon -- higher value and lower carbon.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with our revenue quality, solid execution, enhanced market participation, both in North America and internationally, and most importantly, the translation of all of these elements into another successive quarter of margin expansion.  
I want to thank here the entire Schlumberger team as they continue to execute and deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our communities despite COVID impact in several parts of the world.  
Next, I would like to share my view on the macroeconomic environment supporting our industry. While the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant and resurgence of related disruptions could impact the pace of economic reopening, recent market projections continue to affirm an improving global economic outlook.  
Global GDP growth is now expected to approach 6% in 2021 and more than 4% in 2022, which should continue to drive a progressive recovery of oil demand. This outlook is supported by recent oil demand updates, which reflect the anticipation of wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improved mobility and additional fiscal stimulus in large economies through the second half of the year.  
Looking farther out, the IEA projects that global oil demand will reach 100 million barrels per day and surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 in the absence of further policy change.  
With oil price at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle project, reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore developments and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter.  
In North America, this supply response is reflected in the rig count and factory trends, which sustained strong growth through the first half of the year. Private operator-led activity growth which resulted from the acceleration of DUC completion and increased drilling activity to replenish DUC inventory. By contrast, the embrace of capital discipline by the public operators is highlighted by the rig count still being significantly below the Q1 2020 total despite WTI price exceeding pre-pandemic levels.  
In this context, despite a solid activity growth outlook, we maintain our view that the North American market will be structurally smaller than in previous cycle as a consequence of capital discipline and industry consolidation.  
Moving to international markets. The deficit of investment needed to deliver the required oil supply represent a sustained growth opportunity, particularly in the low-cost, advantaged basins. We remain constructive on the structural pull on international supply and the resulting activity impact. This was already visible in the second quarter with a strong seasonal rebound and offshore recovery despite the impact of COVID disruption in part of Asia and in the Middle East. This also marked the second consecutive quarter of international rig count growth.  
Looking further out, we see favorable conditions for durable investment growth driven by the combination of actions by NOCs, internationally focused investment by public E&P operators and the expectation of continued supply discipline by OPEC+, all in response to the steady evolution of demand. The current pace of international tendering contract awards and increasing book-to-bill ratio support this view. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger is extremely well positioned, both in international markets and in North America. Our market exposure is biased to accretive growth. And with a series of new contract wins, our leading digital and fit-for-basin technology portfolio and our performance strategy, we will create value for our customers and deliver industry-leading returns.  
Turning to the third quarter outlook. In North America, we see another quarter of growth, albeit somewhat moderating in U.S. land, led by private operators and horizontal oil drilling and a seasonal recovery in Canada. North America offshore will remain resilient, albeit with the hurricane season in view.  
Moving to the international markets. Positive growth momentum is expected to continue through the third quarter across all areas. Short-cycle activity will be augmented by longer-cycle project start-up.  
In this context, directionally, we expect our global third quarter revenue to grow by mid-single digits led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction divisions, while our pretax segment operating margins should further expand by 50 to 100 basis points.  
With this outlook for the third quarter, we remain confident in achieving double-digit international growth in the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. As a consequence, and absent further COVID setback in operational recovery, we now foresee full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America, when excluding the impact of divestiture.  
With activity recovery ahead of us through the third quarter and strong signal of a durable recovery beyond that, we can now clearly see a path to the high end of our full year EBITDA margin expansion guidance for 2021.  
Looking further ahead, the fundamentals remain very favorable, with a growing economic rebound, supportive oil prices and a demand and supply outlook all representing a set of unique conditions that will support an exceptional growth cycle. Furthermore, this cycle will be broad-based across geographies and operational environment, land, offshore, North America and particularly, international markets. The second quarter was a strong indication of the future outlook and a testament of our restored earnings power under these conditions.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong quarter -- second quarter results across our entire portfolio, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in delivering our long-term financial ambition.  
I will now pass the call to Stephane."

Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year",773,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year, excluding charges. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first or second quarters of 2021.  
Overall, our second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion increased 8% sequentially. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially, while international revenue increased 7%, both outpacing respective rig count growth.  
Pretax operating margins were 14.3% and have now increased 4 quarters in a row. This represents the highest margin since the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, margins expanded sequentially across all 4 divisions. This performance was driven not only by the seasonal rebound in the Northern Hemisphere, but also a favorable revenue mix as a result of increased offshore activity, new technology adoption and increased exploration and appraisal activity.  
Company-wide, adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% for the second quarter increased 118 basis points sequentially and is the highest since the third quarter of 2018. I am very pleased with this margin performance, which reflects the benefit of significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost reduction program. This performance also gives me the confidence that we will continue to increase margins in the third quarter and beyond.  
Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division.  
Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $817 million, increased 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 147 basis points to 33%. These increases were primarily driven by strong digital solution sales.  
Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.1 billion increased 12% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity, which resulted in international revenue increasing by 13%. Margins expanded 373 basis points to 13.9%, largely due to the seasonal recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and increased offshore and exploration activity as well as favorable technology mix in the Middle East and Africa.  
Well Construction revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins increased 209 basis points to 12.9%. These improvements were driven by strong performance both in North America and internationally. U.S. land revenue grew by over 30%, significantly outpacing the increase in rig count. International activity increased beyond the seasonal rebound as many countries experienced double-digit revenue growth.  
Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially, and margins increased 146 basis points to 10.2%. These increases were primarily driven by higher activity in Europe, Africa and North America.  
Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $869 million despite severance payments of $72 million. The amounts included the receipt of $477 million U.S. federal tax refund relating to prior years. This refund helped support our deleveraging efforts during the quarter. In this regard, our gross debt decreased by $861 million during the quarter. We have begun to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as demonstrated by the early redemption in June of all $665 million of notes that were coming due in September. We also repaid $236 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Net debt decreased sequentially by $632 million to $13 billion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017.  
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $351 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments.  
In total, during the first half of 2021, we generated over $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and over $1 billion of free cash flow. These amounts are fully expected to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with historical trends. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to continue to deleverage the balance sheet and provide us with flexibility in our capital allocation.  
One last item worth highlighting is that during the quarter, we replaced our EUR 750 million credit facility with a new 3-year EUR 750 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The terms of this facility are aligned with the interim emissions reduction targets disclosed as part of our net-zero emissions commitment announced this quarter. This is a first for Schlumberger and further demonstrates our commitment to fully participate in the decarbonization of the industry.  
I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

You are correct. I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion.  
So first and foremost, I think the performance was led by revenue expansion, revenue growth. I think revenue growth has worked out to be at or ahead of our expectation, both internationally and in North America. I think credit to our team, credit to the customer centricity, the new organization and our performance.  
Secondly, I think the -- we have seen a significant effect of our operating leverage as well as operational efficiency playing in full light during the quarter, and we expect this to be the base of our margin expansion for the quarters to come. So this was in full display in all divisions and has led to this significant margin expansion, particularly in the service-led Reservoir Performance and Well Construction.  
Thirdly, the revenue quality, as I recall it, was led by activity -- favorable activity mix coming from the seasonal rebound in some basins, some regions. And that included an offshore mix that was favorable to those 2 division as well as well as an exploration and appraisal uptick, mid-teens exploration and appraisal offshore quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter. So when you combine this, this is representing a revenue mix quality that I think is unique. This was supplemented by technology adoption. Technology adoptions linked to our fit-for-basin solution for customers that are seeing success. Digital, as you heard during the remarks prepared by Stephane, and likely the new technology Transition Technologies portfolio, a combination of which is creating revenue quality that is then impacting favorably our margin.  
Lastly, and this was only notable -- not noticeable in North America, we had a couple of green shoots on pricing on Well Construction that also starting to be recognized.  
So project this forward, I think the seasonal rebound will not always be there every quarter. The unique exploration and appraisal uptick mix that we got also will not repeat. But you can count on us to leverage the future growth in the industry, both in North America and internationally to seize the operating leverage and operating efficiency we have, the favorable mix and the technology adoption that should fuel our margin expansion going forward."

First, progress on our platform strategy.

And I think we have made much progress there, and I think we are in the eighth or the ninth inning, if you like, on the platform readiness for full scalability and expansion. And we made progress on the adoption of DELFI as you have seen some announcements, and we continue to progress on rolling out for the client that have already adopted DELFI. Hence, our revenue on the DELFI and the new technology of digital was significantly accretive to our growth, significantly accretive to [ D&I ] and resulted into margin expansion flow-through that was visible this quarter. 
So that will not continue the same every quarter. It depends on the seasonality and on the specific, but expect the -- directionally to continue to grow."

First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on the second quarter growth. It was all basins, all divisions internationally so it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East, in particular,",356,"Yes. First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on the second quarter growth. It was all basins, all divisions internationally so it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East, in particular, the growth was maybe more muted or less aggressive and less accretive to the overall growth than other basins. And there are a couple of reasons for that. 
And the first and foremost reason is relating to the supply constraints that are still outstanding on the back and as such, muting some of the short-cycle activity that we could have expected to rebound faster. So now going forward, there are a couple of factors that will play favorably short term and midterm. 
Short term, there will be a relief of some of these supply constraints that will continue to inch up the short-cycle activity, including in Saudi. There is a commitment in Middle East for gas development. And I think Qatar was the first to expand their commitment, and we have benefited greatly from that rebound in activity for the last couple of quarters, and this will extend also to a couple of other countries, including Saudi. 
And lastly, as we turn into 2022, we have heard some signal from a couple of countries in GCC that have signaled that they will commit to production capacity increase to fulfill their opportunity to gain share as there will be a pull on international supply. So this will result from 2022 in combination of short cycle, gas development and long cycle across that region. And hence, they will catch up, and they will certainly be a region that will lead the activity growth and will support in second half our double-digit year-on-year H2 and next year into a strong growth going forward. 
Finally, if I have to make a comment on this, I think you may have seen some contract wins and contract award in Middle East. And we believe that on top of this activity growth, we have the potential to outperform and then getting a further tailwind to our growth going forward."

So accounting for this, however, we will still generate significant excess cash flow throughout the growth cycle. This is, of course, very good news. It gives us optionality in our capital allocation, particularly to execute our strategy and to fund our new horizons of growth. 
Now whether it relates to our core portfolio or expansion into digital or new energy, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework.

First and foremost, performance in the way we execute, and I think has led to from cementing to drilling, directional drilling [ amidst ] market share gain with both private and with operators, public operators in the U.S. 
The second factor is that, as you remember, as part of our North America strategy pivot we did initiate 2 years ago, we accelerated our technology access, giving access of fit-for-basin technology to some local DD company that are then using, renting or buying our equipment and using it to serve their local customers, mostly, if not exclusively, private. So this has been going quarter-on-quarter, and this is helping us to reach market and expand our market share beyond what we could do to our service arm. 
And finally, as I mentioned in my -- in one of my response earlier, we had some green shoots where our performance was in high demand, our directional drilling equipment was seen as unique to deliver the curve. Hence, we could extract some pricing premium. So the combination of these 3 have delivered this [ 30% plus ] quarter-on-quarter top line delivery, far outpacing the account growth.

It's something that we're working out to continue to make progress. But I think in a nutshell, I think the step change we did in some of the operational environment, our operational practice, including digital operation, has given us the opportunity to respond on the first peak of this cycle without deploying the same resource set as we had in the past, hence, getting direct efficiency gain as we mobilize and grow with the cycle. 
Going forward, and already initiated in some geographies where we had more than double-digit growth, as I mentioned, we had access to some resource that we onboarded during the quarter to respond to the contract we are winning. So the long cycle actually nature of international give us a bit more long-term visibility to this condition. Hence, our market approach is to target specific geographies and business line where we believe we can be generating accretive returns and growth and prepare for it by mobilizing ahead the resource or moving resource to address those. 
So I think we have a global access to talent. We are using a lot and at scale this remote operation. So it is a challenge for us to respond to high demand, but we believe that we have the operational environment to make it a success."

Let me first clarify and not mix in the same umbrella. The New Energy portfolio that we have developed with the purpose to create a new chapter beyond oil and gas [ to participate ] scaling to the energy transition from hydrogen to CCS and geo energy or lithium, as you have heard, from the Transition Technologies that we believe are very pertinent to the decarbonization of our oil and gas industry, helping our customers to reduce their footprint, CO2 footprint, to reduce their GHG emission. And in this context, we are focusing on flaring elimination or reduction, and you are using, in particular, the Ora wireline technology to avoid returning the fluids to the surface and burn and dispose through flaring and do the reservoir characterization and testing in situ, if you like. And that's a unique technology that has significant impact on both efficiency and on the CO2 footprint for everyone using it. 
And we are looking at methane emission detection and containment. And we are looking at, as you have seen in the press release this morning also the CYNARA CO2 membrane that have superior performance for large asset gas treatment, if you want, to do CO2 sequestration and capture. 
So you have these 2 aspects. So the Transition Technologies will come more and more into play. And most of the customer I meet are asking us whether we can help them and have a conversation engagement on to methane detection, flaring or other techniques that eliminate or reduce significantly the footprint of CO2 on every operation on their Scope 3 [ upstream ], if you like, in addition to their Scope 1 direct emission. And then [indiscernible] and that will be part of our technology growth, technology adoption in the quarters to come. 
And then longer term, we will build on our New Energy portfolio that we are building. And then once we have -- continue to build this, we will grow at scale from hydrogen to CCS and bio energy with CFCs for the heating and cooling of buildings to lithium production of the pilot that we are initiating, and the contribution from Panasonic give us the opportunity to do so. So these are 2 different avenue for growth short term and long term."

I think first and foremost, I think let me highlight the, I think, 2 different, I would say, factor that will indeed leverage our current platform. 
First is the global deployment capability we have. We can industrialize and ship technology and deploy technology anywhere in the world, and we have done so for more than 80 or 90 years. And I think our ability to create franchise in every country from technology developed centrally or we developed locally, I think, is something that is unique, and I think that differentiates from many of the pure plays.  
The relationship we have and the customer base we have today will be occasionally, and I think will be in the sense of the CCS where our customers have the opportunity to participate or in some of the downstream operation where they have a carbon capture or [indiscernible] opportunity would be an opportunity for us to continue to work with that customer base and expand. And at the same time, some of this company are turning into integrated energy company that will also participate at scale in the same market as we do. So that relationship will be useful, but I will more, I would say, highlight the global deployment capability. 
Now when it comes to capital allocation and capital deployment, I think it's very difficult to pinpoint to you specific here. I think we will gain -- continue to mature this venture, prepare for scale as we start to, I would say, progress on our milestones, progress on our partnership and progress on the business model and the supply chain model that are quite different from the one we experience today.

Now if you look at the current production of the U.S., which is 1.5 million barrels or about below in U.S. land, below what it was in early 2020, this gap has not yet been breached. And I think I do not expect this to be breached as we exit 2022. So there will be an increment of oil supply that will pull on international market that the market can deliver today. But for sustainability in '23 and '24, the market will have to commit capacity. Hence, this is the reason why in Middle East and other country, you see this [ crude ] commitment of capacity. And this is the reason why you see the return of offshore and the commitment of FID. 
We have 50 FID about already to date. We expect to be 100 FID, most of them in offshore at the end of the year. This is 50% more than it was last year, and the trajectory is towards 150, another 50% increment after that.

So we did have a bit of a nice windfall on increased WTI in the second quarter from our Canada asset, but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not material. 
In Ecuador, by the way, at this level of WTI, our tariffs are either fixed or when they are variable, they are capped. And we have passed that cap. So there is little sensitivity to oil price at this level besides Canada. 
Now it makes it a very good time to actually monetize our assets, right? It's -- it has generated cash flow lately because of the oil price and the investment level we put in there. 
Historically, it's an asset that requires quite a bit of CapEx. And so when we close the transaction, we shouldn't see a big impact on our cash flow, and we'll get, of course, hopefully, very good proceeds from the transaction."

So to conclude the call, I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, the second quarter results clearly demonstrate both the strength of our market position, particularly internationally, with sequential growth in all divisions and basins, and our significant operating leverage, resulting in more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion internationally with all divisions contributing significant [ pull-through ]. 
Second, the activity and customer trends observed during the quarter reinforce our conviction in an increasingly favorable outlook, a broad recovery across all basins and operating environments and with a much improved contribution from new technology adoption. 
Third, and absent further COVID setbacks impacting activity or economic rebounds, we are confident that the momentum for this up cycle, both North America and internationally, will continue during the second half of 2021 and will lead to another quarter of growth and margin expansion. 
As a consequence, we remain confident in our second half guidance shared previously for international growth and have increased our confidence in our full year margin expansion and cash flow generation. 
Finally, as we look further ahead, the conditions are set for an exceptional growth cycle in response to the call for supply in 2022 and future demand growth in subsequent years. This will increasingly favor international supply impacting land and offshore, short and long cycle globally. 
Ladies and gentlemen, our returns-focused strategy, international footprint, digital decarbonization and new energy strategic initiatives are highly differentiated, and we support our outperformance ambition throughout the cycle and beyond as we continue to write a new chapter for the company.

In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I",1922,"Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets, and finally, a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we'll open the floor for questions. 
The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion. 
Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital and new energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity, driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. 
Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding pre-pandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. 
Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter through competitive tenders, direct awards and contract expansion, some of which include net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. 
We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top and bottom line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. 
Moving to Digital. We continue to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the feed, complementing our Agora platform and Sensia solutions. 
And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance and carbon footprint. 
As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows and operations. 
Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position in stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. 
In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization road map for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. 
To conclude on this quarter's performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team not only for delivering another strong quarter but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks with oil and gas price attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest level in the recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America, have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. 
In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different paces across different basins, operating environments and customer groups, resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. 
For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021, and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. 
By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position, and with our strong presence and commitment, will benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. 
In the offshore markets, we also set for a strong resurgence in this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming [ years ]. Advances in new technology, digital and integration are driving performance offshore, from discovery to well construction, production and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. 
In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. 
Taking these factors together, a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantages hubs, independent fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets and NOC unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement and integration capability, are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. 
Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies portfolio and the accelerated adoption of this technology that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring and electrification and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net-zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. 
Turning to the fourth quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift tempered by seasonal -- typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. 
With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. 
Building on third quarter operating margin and recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. 
Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity and all customer groups. 
North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen, and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. 
Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response both in oil and gas. 
More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which combined with the favorable market position I've just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we're also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above pre-pandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. 
Additionally, through our Fit-for-Basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey, resulting in accretive revenue and earning growth. 
Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and are increasingly confident in achieving our mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I'll now pass the call to Stephane."

Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared",755,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a start-up company we had previously invested in. This company was acquired during the quarter and, as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. 
Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. 
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning and, where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation. As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. 
Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity as well as accelerated new technology adoption. 
Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. 
Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operation was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. 
We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. 
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multi-client. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during the same period. 
Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

Indeed, we are very, very proud and very satisfied with the last 5 quarters. I think they have demonstrated our ability to leverage restructuring, [indiscernible] and the foundation we have put in place during this reset we have operated in the last 18 months. But furthermore, I think the -- looking forward as the cycle will unfold, I think there are 2 or 3 characteristics that are -- that will play favorably and that will help us continue to expand the margin as we have seen in the last quarter. 
So first, I believe that the market outlook will create favorable market environment, exposing the basins where we have a strong position internationally and, in particular, Middle East so offshore, as I commented during my prepared remarks. Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly, Hence, our technology offering, Fit-for-Basin, Transition Technologies and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance and Production System. 
Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. 
And finally, as the revenue -- as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that give us a premium and a performance [indiscernible] integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle."

First, obviously, the acceleration of digital adoption by customers through our group load data and digital operation offering, and you are seeing element of this being announced every quarter. And you will continue to see this unfolding across the different customer groups and across different geographies. So this will mean accretive growth in 2022 to our top line by the digital offering we have. 
The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effect of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will be and continue to help us operate D&I at above 30% or mid-30s and also will result into our ability to extract from digital operation and our own operation, [indiscernible] integrated performance in Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence, to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions."

I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens year-on-year in H2-over-H2. So that's proof that this activity translating into revenue opportunity. 
And I think the offshore markets, both [indiscernible] internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last 2 to 4 quarters. But now looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicator. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year or if you look at the projection of some of the projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID most likely sanctioned by the end of this year and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. 
So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing on the hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And this international independent are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. 
And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite  positive and constructive and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contract are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future."

And so given the commentary that you expect exceptional growth in a multiyear cycle in the oil and gas industry, this obviously leads you to believe that there's not going to be this under-investment going forward. So maybe if you can kind of provide some color around this and thoughts around the disconnect between some investor perception that you're not going to see a reinvestment cycle going forward."

We are living with -- from the result of under-investment in the last 5 to 7 years, combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020 and also an elevated capital discipline, partly in North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass to the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year, I think the result of which will create a pull on international supply and will create a necessity for investment in our industry. 
So the questions are very simple. There is an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment into our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest into their capacity going forward. The IOCs are re-concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the one leading the growth in this cycle but they will be the one pursuing still the advantaged basins to generate the cash they need to transition to New Energy. 
The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the assets, undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity. More will have to be built. Hence, it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have a long-tail effect beyond the '22/'23 horizon."

And this will turn into more long cycle as both the gas development is accelerating, and you have seen the [indiscernible] announcement from Saudi and the continuation of a large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of '24-2027, depending on the country.

And there are few countries that are committed to accelerate that gas transition. India is the most feasible 1 that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically.

And I look at Emerson and Aspen, the transaction that they recently did, try to put a better marker on the value of digital.

So I would like to conclude the call and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally, internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt. 
Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards in the quarter across Middle East, offshore and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. 
Thirdly, we are confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue, allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America and full year margin expansion on the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our strategy execution progress to date, the enthusiasm of our entire team and the elevated trust of our customers. I look forward to the coming quarters with increased confidence. Our returns-focused strategic execution has created the conditions for a unique outperformance in our core and digital offering at the onset of this up-cycle whilst elevating our sustainability commitment and accelerating our new energy strategic initiatives. Thank you very much."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets, and finally, a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we'll open the floor for questions. 
The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion. 
Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital and new energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity, driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. 
Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding pre-pandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. 
Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter through competitive tenders, direct awards and contract expansion, some of which include net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. 
We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top and bottom line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. 
Moving to Digital. We continue to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the feed, complementing our Agora platform and Sensia solutions. 
And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance and carbon footprint. 
As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows and operations. 
Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position in stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. 
In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization road map for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. 
To conclude on this quarter's performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team not only for delivering another strong quarter but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks with oil and gas price attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest level in the recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America, have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. 
In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different paces across different basins, operating environments and customer groups, resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. 
For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021, and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. 
By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position, and with our strong presence and commitment, will benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. 
In the offshore markets, we also set for a strong resurgence this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming [ years ]. Advances in new technology, digital and integration are driving performance impact offshore, from discovery to well construction, production and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. 
In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. 
Taking these factors together, a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantaged hubs, independent fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets and NOC unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement and integration capability, are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. 
Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies portfolio and the accelerated adoption of this technology that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring and electrification and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net-zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. 
Turning to the fourth quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift tempered by seasonal -- typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. 
With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. 
Building on third quarter operating margin and recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. 
Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity and all customer groups. 
North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen, and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. 
Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response both in oil and gas. 
More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which combined with the favorable market position I've just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we're also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above pre-pandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. 
Additionally, through our Fit-for-Basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey, resulting in accretive revenue and earning growth. 
Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and are increasingly confident in achieving our mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I'll now pass the call to Stephane."

Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared",755,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a start-up company we had previously invested in. This company was acquired during the quarter and, as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. 
Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. 
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. 
We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning and, where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation. As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. 
Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity as well as accelerated new technology adoption. 
Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. 
Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operation was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. 
We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. 
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multi-client. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during the same period. 
Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

Indeed, we are very, very proud and very satisfied with the last 5 quarters. I think they have demonstrated our ability to leverage restructuring, [indiscernible] and the foundation we have put in place during this reset we have operated in the last 18 months. But furthermore, I think the -- looking forward as the cycle will unfold, I think there are 2 or 3 characteristics that are -- that will play favorably and that will help us continue to expand the margin as we have seen in the last quarter. 
So first, I believe that the market outlook will create favorable market environment, exposing the basins where we have a strong position internationally and, in particular, Middle East so offshore, as I commented during my prepared remarks. Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly, Hence, our technology offering, Fit-for-Basin, Transition Technologies and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance and Production System. 
Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. 
And finally, as the revenue -- as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that give us a premium and a performance [indiscernible] integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle."

The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effect of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will be and continue to help us operate D&I at above 30% or mid-30s and also will result into our ability to extract from digital operation and our own operation, [ partly ] integrated performance in Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence, to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions."

I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And",349,"Yes. I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens year-on-year in H2-over-H2. So that's proof that this activity translating into revenue opportunity. 
And I think the offshore markets, both [ partly ] internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last 2 to 4 quarters. But now looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicator. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year or if you look at the projection of some of the [ market ] projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID most likely sanctioned by the end of this year and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. 
So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing on the hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And this international independent are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. 
And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite positive and constructive and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contract are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future."

There seems to be this growing narrative out there that the oil and gas industry is going to continue to under-invest this cycle, given the discipline narrative of the E&P industry and also kind of this energy transition focus. And obviously, you talked to more E&P and oil and gas producers than probably anybody worldwide. 
And so given the commentary that you expect exceptional growth in a multiyear cycle in the oil and gas industry, this obviously leads you to believe that there's not going to be this under-investment going forward. So maybe if you can kind of provide some color around this and thoughts around the disconnect between some investor perception that you're not going to see a reinvestment cycle going forward."

We are living with -- from the result of under-investment in the last 5 to 7 years, combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020 and also an elevated capital discipline, partly in North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass to the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year, I think the result of which will create a pull on international supply and will create a necessity for investment in our industry. 
So the questions are very simple. There is an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment into our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest into their capacity going forward. The IOCs are re-concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the one leading the growth in this cycle but they will be the one pursuing still the advantaged basins to generate the cash they need to transition to New Energy. 
The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the [ collection ] assets, undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity. More will have to be built. Hence, it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have a long-tail effect beyond the '22/'23 horizon."

So that's the effect on short cycle. 
This will also include a rig remobilization to do some infill drilling to start to support this increment of barrels for the country that have the capacity to expand fast. And this will turn into more long cycle as both the gas development is accelerating, and you have seen the [indiscernible] announcement from Saudi and the continuation of a large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of '24-2027, depending on the country.

Now with accelerate, I think the gas supply/demand is misbalanced this year, will recover a little bit next year but will continue its strong trajectory going forward. And there are few countries that are committed to accelerate that gas transition. India is the most feasible one that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically. 
So Middle East, domestic gas, India as an engine of growth for gas beyond the current mix and some specific security supply that will trigger some gas development from existing gas, the redevelopment or short-cycle activity.

So I would like to conclude the call and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally, internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt. 
Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards in the quarter across Middle East, offshore and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. 
Thirdly, we are confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue, allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America and full year margin expansion on the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our strategy execution progress to date, the enthusiasm of our entire team and the elevated trust of our customers.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets, and finally, a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we'll open the floor for questions. 
The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained, and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion. 
Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital and New Energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity, driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. 
Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding pre-pandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. 
Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter through competitive tenders, direct awards and contract expansion, some of which include net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. 
We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top and bottom line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. 
Moving to Digital. We continued to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the field, complementing our Agora platform and Sensia solutions. 
And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance and carbon footprint. 
As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows and operations. 
Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position in stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. 
In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization road map for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. 
To conclude on this quarter's performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team not only for delivering another strong quarter but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks with oil and gas price attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest level in the recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America, have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. 
In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different paces across different basins, operating environments and customer groups, resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. 
For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021, and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. 
By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position, and with our strong presence and commitment, we'll benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. 
In the offshore markets, we are also set for a strong resurgence this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming years. Advances in new technology, digital and integration are driving performance impact offshore, from discovery to well construction, production and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. 
In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. 
Taking these factors together, a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantaged hubs, independents fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets and NOC unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement and integration capability, are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. 
Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies portfolio and the accelerated adoption of this technology that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring and electrification and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net-zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. 
Turning to the fourth quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift, tempered by seasonal -- by typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. 
With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. 
Building on third quarter operating margin at recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. 
Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity and all customer groups. 
North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen, and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. 
Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response both in oil and gas. 
More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which, combined with the favorable market position I've just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we're also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above prepandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. 
Additionally, through our Fit-for-Basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey, resulting in accretive revenue and earning growth. 
Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and are increasingly confident in achieving our mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I'll now pass the call to Stephane."

Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared",755,"Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a start-up company we had previously invested in. This company was acquired during the quarter and, as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. 
Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. 
Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. 
We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning and, where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation. As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. 
Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity as well as accelerated new technology adoption. 
Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. 
Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operation was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. 
We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. 
During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during this same period. 
Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier."

Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly, hence, our technology offering, Fit-for-Basin, Transition Technologies and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance and Production Systems. 
Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. 
And finally, as the revenue -- as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that give us a premium and a performance differentiation, integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle."

So this will mean accretive growth in 2022 to our top line by the digital offering we have. 
The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effect of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will be and continue to help us operate D&I at above 30% or mid-30s and also will result into our ability to extract from digital operation and our own operation, particularly integrated performance in Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence, to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions."

I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been -- the rig activity has been increasing lately.",346,"Yes. I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been -- the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens year-on-year in H2-over-H2. So that's proof that this activity translating into revenue opportunity. 
And I think the offshore markets, both, particularly internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last 2 to 4 quarters. But now looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicator. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year or if you look at the projection of some of the WoodMac projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID most likely sanctioned by the end of this year and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. 
So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing on the hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And this international independents are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. 
And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite positive and constructive and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contract are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future."

There seems to be this growing narrative out there that the oil and gas industry is going to continue to underinvest this cycle, given the discipline narrative of the E&P industry and also kind of this energy transition focus. And obviously, you talk to more E&P and oil and gas producers than probably anybody worldwide. 
And so given the commentary that you expect exceptional growth in a multiyear cycle in the oil and gas industry, this obviously leads you to believe that there's not going to be this underinvestment going forward. So maybe if you can kind of provide some color around this and thoughts around the disconnect between some investor perception that you're not going to see a reinvestment cycle going forward."

We are living with -- from the result of underinvestment in the last 5 to 7 years, combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020 and also an elevated capital discipline, particularly in North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass -- to the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year, I think the result of which will catapult international supply and will create a necessity for investment in our industry. 
So the equation are very simple. There is an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment into our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest into their capacity going forward. The IOCs are re-concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the one leading the growth in this cycle, but they will be the one pursuing still the advantaged basins to generate the cash they need to transition to New Energy. 
The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the conditional set, undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity, more will have to be built, hence, it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have a long-tail effect beyond the '22, '23 horizon."

So that's the effect on short cycle. 
This will also include rig remobilization to do some infill drilling to start to support this increment of barrels for the country that have the capacity to expand fast. And this will turn into more long cycle as both the gas development is accelerating, and you have seen the Jafurah announcement from Saudi and the continuation of large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of '24-2027, depending on the country.

But also you have to add to the mix the fact that you are, in going into a seasonal effect in Northern Hemisphere and to lower mix of exploration appraisal, that will have an effect and seasonality of Reservoir Performance. That is something that we -- that happens every year. And where the third quarter is typically the high margin quarter due to this probable offshore exposure in our present mix, that declines for 1 or 2 quarters before it rebounds strongly every spring.

And yes, we've progressed quite well, and we are very happy with it. So now we do have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2x net debt-to-EBITDA target leverage, and we said we should do that by the end of 2022. 
With the earnings expansion we are expecting in this growth cycle and our continuous focus on capital stewardship, yes, we will continue to generate significant excess cash in the next few years. So this will allow us to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders as well as fund new growth opportunities. 
As it relates to returns to shareholders, this is something we will continue to review with our Board of Directors as the cycle unfolds and the deleveraging of our balance sheet accelerates. And as it relates to new growth opportunities, we will -- whether it's in digital, New Energy, any new investment, we will continue to look at under the strict lens of our returns-based capital strategy framework. 
Your question on Liberty. Clearly, we are happy with the transaction we made now more than a year ago. We are benefiting from the recovery in North America through the significant appreciation of our equity stake there. And yes, monetization is clearly an option. The timing and the pace and the magnitude of this monetization will be based on  the market conditions and the outlook. But we'll make sure we'll optimize it basically."

Is it 1/3, 1/3, 1/3? Is it 50-50? I'm just kind of curious how we should think about that coming through."

But suffice to say that I think our operating leverage would indeed be a base for margin expansion to the way we execute with efficiency using our own digital transformation to execute and extract performance from our execution. So that's the base. 
Above that, I will place the technology first and the technology mix adoption from Fit-for-Basin that are highly differentiated and successful in all basin. I will include the Transition Technologies that are starting to emerge as a unique differentiator. And it will include also the integration delivery performance in integration contract. 
And then indeed and you are correct, our digital expansion will be favorable on top. So I think you have these 3 things, but I don't want to be starting to be trying to create a boundary between these, I don't think it's appropriate. And I think it will depend on every basin and every division will have a different trajectory, but we are confident that across the profile we have, considering the international mix, considering the offshore, considering the technology adoption that is coming back, I think this -- we have the path forward."

So I think you see that the existing reserves, be it on commercial or conventional offshore and onshore will be commercialized by our customers as long as they have a path to market through LNG or they have a path to market through pipeline. So we see this accelerating. You have seen some of the critical announcement we made this morning relating to onshore, offshore, unconventional and conventional gas developments, and we see it as a trend that is not about to stop. 
Now, will it accelerate? I think the gas supply/demand is misbalanced this year, will recover a little bit next year but will continue the strong trajectory going forward. And we have a few countries that are committed to accelerate that gas transition. India is certainly the most visible one that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically. 
So Middle East domestic gas, India as an engine of growth for gas beyond the current mix and some specific security of supply that will trigger some gas development from existing gas, the redevelopment or short-cycle activity. So I'm optimistic, hence, very, very pleased with the gas contract we have been winning this quarter."

What I will say for exploration is that we are seeing 2 things coming back. We are seeing some seismic activity coming back, including there are some proof that the seismic boat utilization is going. But what is more critical is the near-field exploration is triggering more activity in exploration going forward as everybody wants to get better return on their existing infrastructure to create tieback. And hence, we have seen some licensing rounds as well. So licensing rounds, some seismic survey coming back and exploration, near-field exploration for future infill or tieback is what we see. So to give you a magnitude, directionally, it will increase, but to keep in mind it is too early."

So I would like to conclude the call, and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally -- internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt.
Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards during the quarter across Middle East, offshore and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. 
Thirdly, we are confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue, allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America and full year margin expansion on the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle, unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger.
