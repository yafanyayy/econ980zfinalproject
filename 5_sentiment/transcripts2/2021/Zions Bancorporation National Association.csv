We want to welcome all of you to our call this afternoon. Beginning on Slide 3. We are very pleased with the overall results for the quarter. One very significant driver of the increase in earnings per share from the prior quarter",462,"Thanks very much, James. We want to welcome all of you to our call this afternoon. Beginning on Slide 3. We are very pleased with the overall results for the quarter. One very significant driver of the increase in earnings per share from the prior quarter was the reduction in the allowance for credit loss, which, when coupled with only 13 basis points of annualized loan losses relative to average non-PPP loans, resulted in a negative provision for credit losses of nearly $70 million.
While we continue to expect that credit losses will remain elevated relative to our long-term trend level, and there is continued uncertainty with respect to the ultimate impact of borrowers from the pandemic, we have been very encouraged by the resiliency of a great many of our customers.
Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $280 million, reflecting a slight linked-quarter decline in net interest income and stable customer-related fee income. Notably, the adjusted PPNR figure is slightly higher than the year ago period, helped by income from the Paycheck Protection Program.
As we've noted numerous times over the last several years, we were resolved to enter whatever downturn was on the horizon, the strong relative and absolute capital ratios. A 10.8% common equity Tier 1 capital and an allowance for credit losses relative to loans of 1.75% on non-PPP loans, we still maintain one of the strongest combinations of CET1 and the ACL within the large regional banking space.
On that end, we've stated that we'll consider increasing capital distributions as the storm passes. And we are hopeful we are approaching a point where we will resume share repurchases, although it's premature to announce anything today.
Earlier, I noted the strength we saw in net charge-offs, but there are other credit indicators that showed signs of stability, notably nonperforming assets, classified loans and loans on deferral. Perhaps one of the more surprising numbers for the quarter was the net charge-offs realized on the loans that we've grouped into the COVID-19 elevated risk category. The ratio rounds to 0 which is certainly not what we would have expected earlier in the year in 2020. Throughout the quarter, we've seen real-time consumer and business spending data that's been encouraging. For example, for the month of December, our customer's debit card spending was 11% more than the year ago month of December. And credit card spending, which has often been negative when compared to the year ago period, weighed down in part by travel and entertainment spending was slightly positive from the same month a year ago.

So on Slide 4, a quick summary of some key performance indicators for the full year as compared to the prior 2 years. Although net income, return on assets and earnings per share declined, you can see on the chart on the top right that pre-provision net revenue was fairly stable. It would have increased slightly by about $11 million, if we had excluded the charitable contribution of $30 million, that was related to our success with PPP round 1. Similarly, the efficiency ratio would have been 58.3% in 2020, if not for the charitable contribution, a modest improvement to the level achieved in 2019."

Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $280 million in the fourth quarter, as noted. The prior quarter was adversely affected by the $30 million charitable contribution which would have made the prior quarter's number $297 million. The moderate decrease from the prior quarter was largely attributable to a slight decrease in revenue as well as an increase in expense, which Paul will provide detail in his prepared remarks.
On Slide 7, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. Obviously, the negative provision has resulted in a level of profitability that is not sustainable in the long run. Similar to our view that the depressed profitability in the early part of the year was also not likely to persist.
As we enter 2021, I'm encouraged with the progress made on the technology front that has enabled us to do things faster and at a lower cost. We're optimistic that non-PPP loan growth will resume as we get further into 2021 as the economy further strengthens after a challenging year. We remain sanguine that some of our initiatives, the seeds of which were planted years ago, will bear more fruit including mortgage banking, wealth management and loan syndications.
The next section of slides will be covered by Scott McLean, and so I'll turn the time back over to Scott."
315476,674970605,2175925,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, again, to everyone.

Over the last few months, you've heard us talk about our success with round 1 of the Paycheck Protection Program. Given the negative economic impact of the pandemic, and the low interest rate environment, our oversized success with PPP 1.0, as we describe it, has resulted in a meaningful cushion for near-term earnings as well as creating new business opportunities with our core small business customer base. Additionally, our new future core system has proven to be helpful in handling this significant PPP volume in several meaningful ways including its API enablement.
We are now engaged in the forgiveness aspect of the program. Approximately 10,000 customers, representing $1.3 billion of volume, have received SBA forgiveness approval. Of note, over 80% of these loans are less than $150,000, and on average, in excess of 95% of the loan balance has been forgiven. We have a highly controlled process for handling the forgiveness phase, and we've engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to assist, which is part of the noninterest expense increase referenced by Harris.
Round 2 launched last Wednesday, January 13. Last week, we trained over 1,500 frontline bankers in the elements of the program. And as of yesterday, we have taken approximately 20,000 applications. So far, these applications are smaller on average than the average we experienced for PPP 1.0. While it's too early to say how round 2 will compare around 1, we are ready and able to provide the resources to get the stimulus money into the deposit accounts of small businesses that are in great need at this time.
Turning to Slide 9. We've also frequently highlighted that our bankers have been laser-focused on actively calling on the 47,000 PPP 1.0 recipients, more than 14,000 of which represent new to bank customers. Regarding our existing customers, you can see that these were active relationships with $3.8 billion in deposits and $3.6 billion in loans. While we have been successful in originating a significant amount of new loans and services, this portfolio of existing customers will experience churn reflecting the impact of the pandemic and the historical rate of attrition that we experienced. 
Additionally, we were able to strengthen relationships by reaffirming a specific banker for 80% of these approximately 32,700 customers. Further reflecting a deepening of these relationships, the new loans we have originated for these customers has, on average, been greater than their PPP loans. Regarding the 14,700 new to bank customers, 30% are now actively using their [ DBA ] account, and we are seeing good initial loan activity with these small businesses as well. Although we know that we will not be able to retain all of these clients, we are pleased with these early results. 
Finally, it's our observation that many small businesses have been resourceful in building liquidity. And it would appear that a number of these small businesses still have a significant amount of their original PPP loan funding available in their deposit accounts. This should represent a real source of financial strength as we continue to navigate the pandemic.
Finally, advancing to Slide 10. 2020 has been a very successful year in our history for our mortgage banking group driven in no small part by the rollout of our Zip Mortgage digital customer-facing application process, which occurred prior to the significant decline in interest rates and the significant increase in mortgage originations in the country.
The combination of these 2 factors, among others, led to a substantial increase in mortgage banking revenue, with loan sales revenue increasing to $54 million from approximately $17 million in 2019. That's $54 million for the full year of 2020 versus $17 million in 2019. This new process has also allowed us to reduce our turn times by 25% and improved our service levels. Originations exceeded $800 million for 3 quarters. And our pipeline at the beginning of 2021 is higher than the year ago level by [ 66% ].
Next, I'll turn the call over to Paul for remarks on credit and additional detail on our financial performance and condition. Paul?"
315476,674970605,2175925,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin my comments on Slide 11. Generally, we have presented the credit quality ratios in our earnings presentation materials, excluding PPP loans. As Harris noted, classified loans",1898,"Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin my comments on Slide 11. Generally, we have presented the credit quality ratios in our earnings presentation materials, excluding PPP loans. As Harris noted, classified loans and nonperforming loans were somewhat stable with the prior quarter. Overall net charge-offs were 13 basis points and for the year, just 22 basis points. About 4/5 of the fourth quarter and 1/3 of the full year net charge-offs were attributable to the oil and gas portfolio.
Consistent with our credit loss allowance of $104 million against that portfolio, we do expect energy loan charge-offs in the future. However, with the improvement in commodity prices, and some of the restructurings that have taken place, our credit loss reserve on this portfolio reflects an improving outlook.
On the left side of Slide 12, we engaged very early in granting payment deferrals and payment modifications to our borrowers as the pandemic worsened. At December 31, loans on payment deferral status were 0.5% of non-PPP loans. The right side of this page shows loans that are over 90 days past due. Please note at the bottom of these bars are statistics regarding total loans that are delinquent by 90 days or more and still accruing. This has recently remained relatively steady between 2 to 3 basis points of non-PPP loans.
Advancing to Slide 13, the industries represented here are those which we believe to have the greatest risk of default in the current environment. As shown on the right side of the page, the collateral coverage is excellent for this $4 billion of loans, with 98% being covered by collateral often by real estate. Within these loans, collateralized by real estate, the median loan-to-value ratio is 53%, and only 3% of these loans have LTV ratios greater than 90%.
Slide 14 presents the 3 groupings highlighted on the previous slide in a time-series format. The top left chart shows the loan balances in columns with the weighted average risk rate shown in the 3 lines. As indicated by the lines, the elevated risk portfolio experienced some risk grade improvement since September as did the remaining portfolio, excluding oil and gas lending. The oil and gas portfolio's weighted average risk grade remained relatively unchanged.
The loan grade shown here represent the probability of default only. As a reminder, the probability of default combined with loss given default are key drivers of the allowance for credit loss.
The top right chart on Slide 14 shows the trend in classified and nonaccrual loans with the classified ratio being the larger number and the nonaccrual ratio being the smaller number within each bar. The relative stability of the other loans' nonaccrual ratio, which represents 87% of the total non-PP (sic) [ non-PPP ] loan portfolio is encouraging in the current economic environment.
On the bottom right, you can see the net charge-offs related to these groups. The oil and gas portfolio accounted for about 4/5 of the quarter's total net charge-offs, while a very small amount of net charge-offs came from the elevated risk portfolio. 
Slide 15 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. On the top left, you can see the recent trend. The total ACL was $835 million at December 31 or 1.74% of non-PPP loans. On the right side, we described the factors leading to the ACL change in the most recent quarter. The bar chart on the bottom right shows the broad categories of change. $3 million of the ACL decrease is due to the net impact of changes in economic forecasts and changes in the probability weightings of those forecasts.
Credit quality factors represented by the middle bar includes risk grade migration and specific reserves against loans, which combined for a $20 million reduction in the ACL when compared to the prior quarter. Finally, portfolio changes, driven by the aging of the portfolio, the shift in the portfolio from segments that have higher ACLs such as consumer mortgages and oil and gas, and toward segments that have lower ACL, allows for credit losses attached to them, such as municipal lending and other similar factors, generated a $59 million reduction in the ACL.
Slide 16 shows an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows recent trends in both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has compressed in the current quarter relative to prior quarter. However, as shown on the chart on the right, the compression is essentially attributable to the composition of earning assets, namely a greater concentration of lower-yielding money market and investment securities.
The change in the composition of earning assets has been driven by the strong growth in deposits. Average deposits increased $1.8 billion, while average loans, including PPP, declined by $1 billion. As a result, average money market investments and securities increased $3.1 billion when compared to the prior quarter.
Slide 17 highlights loan and deposit growth, and breaks them down by both rate and volume. As shown on the left side of the chart, average non-PPP loans were lower by about $600 million, while period end non-PPP loans were down by only about $30 million. Average PPP loans declined $1 billion, while period end PPP loans declined $1.2 billion. PPP forgiveness reduced PPP loan balances in the quarter, and this is expected to continue into 2021.
Turning to yield on loans. The overall yield increased 3 basis points from the prior quarter. The increase in PPP loan yield from 3.50% -- to 3.50% from 3.03% in the prior quarter is an important factor in the overall loan yield. PPP loans account for nearly 12% of average loans, meaning that a 47 basis point differential or increase in the PPP loan yield added about 5 basis points to the total loan yield.
Partially offsetting that positive change, the yield on new loan production, including line draws, was modestly lower than the yield on maturing loans and paydowns. This trend remained consistent with the third quarter. The resulting yield on non-PPP loans decreased about 3 basis points from the prior quarter.
Shifting to the chart on the right in funding, average total deposits increased 2.7% over the prior quarter. The cost of deposits declined to 8 basis points from 11 basis points in the prior quarter.
Slide 18 reports that our balance sheet sensitivity has increased as deposits have increased and benchmark interest rates have fallen. We are comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we believe the risk to lower rates is limited.
As we indicated in October, and as you can see in the balance sheet tables in the press release, we deployed some of the increase in deposits into securities. The securities purchases for the quarter had an average yield of about 1.25%, 1.25%. The purchase activity helps to offset some of the deposit fuel growth in asset sensitivity, but the absolute level of asset sensitivity is still unusually high relative to our long-term history.
The charts on the right side of the page, that's Page 18 show the interest rate risk -- sorry, the interest rate reset profile of our loan portfolio and include additional detail on the interest rate swap book. On the upper right, the volumes, maturities and associated fixed rates for swaps used to hedge our floating rate loans are shown, while the bottom right highlights loan repricing characteristics.
On Slide 19, consumer-related fees were stable with the prior quarter at $139 million. Mortgage loan sale revenue declined $8 million and was offset by broad-based improvement in several other categories, including interest rate swap sales revenue which is found in the capital markets and foreign exchange line as well as wealth management fees and retail fees.
Noninterest expense, shown on Slide 20, was $424 million in the fourth quarter. After normalizing for the $30 million charitable contribution in the prior quarter, the $12 million increase in noninterest expense included an increase in incentive compensation as credit quality and overall profitability was better than had been expected earlier in the year.
Total compensation and benefits for the full year excluding severance, was $28 million less than in 2019 or 2.5% lower. Average full-time equivalent employees declined about 4.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019, while period end full-time equivalent employees declined nearly 6%.
Helping to drive these savings are our continued efforts to streamline and simplify our operations where possible, which has been enabled in part by our investments in technology. As an example of that can be seen in the application of automation in our workspace. Our technology and operations group has been able to incrementally automate an estimated 285,000 hours of labor in 2020. A significant savings for our organization.
We also reported an increase in our professional and legal services expense. About $3 million of that increase was related to forgiveness, the forgiveness process for PPP round 1 loans. The remainder of the increase can largely be attributed to ongoing technology initiatives.
We are reintroducing our financial outlook, which we suspended for much of 2020 due to the extreme uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Our updated outlook can be found on Page 21, and is our best general estimate of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020's actual results. Quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and I would reiterate our earlier reference to the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.
We are establishing our loan growth outlook, which excludes PPP loans at slightly increasing, which can be interpreted as a growth rate in the low single digits. We expect low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in commercial driven by an expectation for continued solid growth in municipal lending. We expect commercial real estate to be relatively stable, and we expect consumer lending to experience low single-digit growth.
We are establishing our outlook for net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, at slightly increasing which incorporates the current shape of the yield curve, some earning asset growth and some modest pressure on the net interest margin as the securities portfolio yield continues to reset lower, and we experience modest pressure on loan yields.
We are establishing our outlook for customer-related fees at slightly increasing. Mortgage banking income may be subject to some weakness if longer-term interest rates rise. But we expect strength from many other revenue categories, especially as we deepen and strengthen relationships with our PPP customers.
We are establishing our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense at generally stable. As noted on the comments section on this page, on a GAAP basis, we expect the overall level of GAAP noninterest expense in 2021 to be consistent with GAAP noninterest expense for 2020 at about $1.7 billion.
Finally, regarding capital management, we feel very good about the strength of our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.8%, particularly when paired with the relatively low credit losses and relatively stable pre-provision net revenue throughout the pandemic.
It is premature to announce any share repurchase program today. However, we have said that as uncertainty subsides, the prospects of actively managing our capital through share repurchase improves. Of course, the approval of any repurchase program is subject to approval by our Board of Directors and our regulators.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Andrew, would you please open the line for questions."

And what we're trying to say is that what we're continuing to see is similar to that in terms of that quantification, but we haven't been super specific about what that is. But I think it's a fair word, modest.
The -- as it relates to securities growth, we're being -- we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet today. You saw that impact our net interest margin. We are working the whole finance team, the treasury team are working really hard to sort of actively manage that cash. But we also are mindful of a view that the economy could really begin to engage in the second half of the year. And so given the very flat nature of the yield curve, and I would say, a general expectation internally, that things will really improve as we -- or start to really improve as we get into the next half of this year.
We want to be careful about putting on too much duration with that incremental cash that's been added. So the securities -- it's a long way of saying the securities portfolio may grow, but you won't see it grow anywhere close to the amount of excess cash that's been put out over the course of the last quarter."

Yes. Okay. Great. And then maybe just switching to loans real quick on your outlook for loan growth. How much more runoff are you guys expecting at this point in the energy book. And then bigger picture, as you think about C&I demand and maybe small business loan demand going forward. Does the PPP program, does that impact what that loan demand could be for that subset of C&I going forward, just given that they're now flushed with cash and we'll be probably spending some of that in the near term?"

The energy outstandings are actually about -- well, I'm not sure how we reflected it here, but there's about $100 million of PPP loans in the energy outstandings. And so excluding PPP, energy outstandings are around $2.1 billion or so. And that could go down a little bit further, but I do think if oil and gas prices stay where they are and maintain some stability there, I think you're going to see increased drilling, and you'll see greater utilization of lines of credit.
So I don't anticipate -- it could go down the next quarter or 2, some, but I think we'll start to see utilization pick up. And I do think that for small business lending in general, the -- our borrowers, they are building liquidity. We've seen that. I think we've seen it across the country. And they still have a healthy proportion of their PPP fundings to rely on as well. So I think it's going to be the broader economy starting to show real improvement. And we'll start to see lines of credit being utilized at a greater pace as working capital builds up again. And as people start to adjust to the post-pandemic environment."

I fully expect that there'll be reasonable and thoughtful about this. As I -- if I look at the backdrop, what I see is this is a company that has strong capital relative to peers. We have what's been a very solid credit quality certainly relative to peers over the last few quarters. I think that probably relatively gets better as we get through some of the energy issues that  have increased the charge-offs, still leaving us with very low charge-offs. But absent the energy charge-offs, it looks truly great.
And then you have -- I don't expect we're going to see huge loan demands. We expect that we're going to see loans growing, but probably not at the pace that's going to absorb a lot of earnings.

We also noted that as the portfolio migrates, as risk ratings improve, as the economic forecast improves to the extent it does. We saw that this quarter, to the extent that those things continue sort of over and above where our current expectations are for improvement, then those are the things that would lead the allowance for credit losses down. And likewise, a reversal of fortunes on any or all of those could be an offsetting factor on the allowance."

This is -- we know these -- we can count these customers in ones, not in hundreds and thousands. We're keeping track of the calling effort on them through our contact management system. Our CEO and our bankers are highly focused on it. And so it's hard to know where it will end up. But we're encouraged by the early loan growth and new services growth that we see there.
And -- but I'd tell you, it's always more fun to talk about kind of new customers. It's a little sexier. But the approximately 33,000 existing customers, we probably didn't have that close of relationship with some of those. And so this gave us a chance to have a really intimate experience with them. And we're seeing a nice pickup in loans and other services, and just the strengthening of the relationship there.
So if you were going through a pandemic, you'd rather have had 47,000 really intimate interactions than just sitting back on your couch in your jammies. So we're watching it closely. We're measuring it closely.

So we're trying to provide all the pieces so that you can kind of provide your own estimates on how that forgiveness is coming in.
I would say that fourth quarter was a good quarter, kind of when you think that, that was the first quarter of forgiveness. My expectation is that we're going to see that continue into 2020 -- or 2021. So that is -- you can kind of get your arms around that.
But to your point, the hard part will be the second round of PPP. And sort of how fast those come on the books, and then to the extent that borrowers meet the thresholds, how quickly those are forgiven by the SBA. That is a lot murkier to me. But all that being said, I think 2021 will be -- for the next several quarters, at least, significantly impact -- net interest income will be significantly impacted by the existence of the PPP program.
And your math is approximately right. I came up with a slightly different answer when I did this a couple of weeks ago. If you look at the yield, $6.3 billion and 3.5% yield for a full year, that's $220 million. And so divide that by 4, and it's like $55 million associated with PPP."

Beginning on Slide 3. We are very pleased with the overall results of the quarter. One very significant driver of the increase in earnings per share from the prior quarter was the reduction in the allowance for credit loss, which, when coupled with only 13 basis points of annualized loan losses relative to average non-PPP loans, resulted in a negative provision for credit losses of nearly $70 million. While we continue to expect that credit losses will remain elevated relative to our long-term trend level and there is continued uncertainty with respect to the ultimate impact of borrowers from the pandemic, we've been very encouraged by the resiliency of a great many of our customers. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $280 million, reflecting a slight linked-quarter decline in net interest income and stable customer-related fee income. Notably, the adjusted PPNR figure is slightly higher than the year ago period, helped by income from the Paycheck Protection Program. 
As we've noted numerous times over the last several years, we were resolved to enter whatever downturn is on the horizon with strong relative and absolute capital ratios, a 10.8% common equity Tier 1 capital and an allowance for credit losses relative to loans of 1.75% on non-PPP loans. We still maintain one of the strongest combinations of CET1 and the ACL within the large regional banking space. On that end, we've stated that we'll consider increasing capital distributions as the storm passes, and we are hopeful we are approaching a point where we will resume share repurchases, although it's premature to announce anything today. 
Earlier, I noted the strength we saw in net charge-offs, but there are other credit indicators that showed signs of stability, notably nonperforming assets, classified loans and loans on deferral. Perhaps one of the more surprising numbers for the quarter was the net charge-offs realized on the loans that we've grouped into the COVID-19 elevated risk category. The ratio rounds to 0, which is certainly not what we would have expected earlier in the year in 2020. Throughout the quarter, we've seen real-time consumer and business spending data that's been encouraging. For example, for the month of December, our customers' debit card spending was 11% more than the year ago month of December. And credit card spending, which has often been negative when compared to the year ago period, weighed down in part by travel and entertainment spending, was slightly positive from the same month a year ago.

So on Slide 4, a quick summary of some key performance indicators for the full year as compared to the prior 2 years. Although net income, return on assets and earnings per share declined, you can see on the chart on the top right that pre-provision net revenue is fairly stable. It would have increased slightly by about $11 million if we had excluded the charitable contribution of $30 million that was related to our success with PPP Round 1. Similarly, the efficiency ratio would have been 58.3% in 2020 if not for the charitable contribution, a modest improvement to the level achieved in 2019."

Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $280 million in the fourth quarter, as noted. The prior quarter was adversely affected by the $30 million charitable contribution, which would have made the prior quarter's number $297 million. The moderate decrease from the prior quarter was largely attributable to a slight decrease in revenue as well as an increase in expense, which Paul will provide detail in his prepared remarks. 
On Slide 7, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. Obviously, the negative provision has resulted in a level of profitability that is not sustainable in the long run, similar to our view that the depressed profitability in the early part of the year was also not likely to persist. As we enter 2021, I'm encouraged with the progress made on the technology front that has enabled us to do things faster and at a lower cost. We're optimistic that non-PPP loan growth will resume as we get further into 2021 as the economy further strengthens after a challenging year. We remain sanguine that some of our initiatives, the seeds of which were planted years ago, will bear more fruit, including mortgage banking, wealth management and loan syndications. 
The next section of slides will be covered by Scott McLean, and so I'll turn the time back over to Scott."
315476,674970605,2176079,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Harris, and good evening again to everyone.

Over the last few months, you've heard us talk about our success with Round 1 of the Paycheck Protection Program. Given the negative economic impact of the pandemic and the low interest rate environment, our oversized success with PPP 1.0, as we describe it, has resulted in a meaningful cushion for near-term earnings as well as creating new business opportunities with our core small business customer base. Additionally, our new future core system has proven to be helpful in handling this significant PPP volume in several meaningful ways, including its API enablement. 
We're now engaged in the forgiveness aspect of the program. Approximately 10,000 customers, representing $1.3 billion of volume, have received SBA forgiveness approval. Of note, over 80% of these loans are less than $150,000, and on average, in excess of 95% of the loan balance has been forgiven. We have a highly controlled process for handling the forgiveness phase, and we've engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to assist, which is part of the noninterest expense increase referenced by Harris. 
Round 2 launched last Wednesday, January 13. Last week, we trained over 1,500 frontline bankers in the elements of the program. And as of yesterday, we have taken approximately 20,000 applications. So far, these applications are smaller on average than the average we experienced for PPP 1.0. While it's too early to say how Round 2 will compare to Round 1, we are ready and able to provide the resources to get the stimulus money into the deposit accounts of small businesses that are in great need at this time. 
Turning to Slide 9. We've also frequently highlighted that our bankers have been laser-focused on actively calling on the 47,000 PPP 1.0 recipients, more than 14,000 of which represent new-to-bank customers. 
Regarding our existing customers, you can see that these were active relationships with $3.8 billion in deposits and $3.6 billion in loans. While we have been successful in originating a significant amount of new loans and services, this portfolio of existing customers will experience churn, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and the historical rate of attrition that we experienced. Additionally, we were able to strengthen relationships by reaffirming a specific banker for 80% of these approximately 32,700 customers. Further reflecting a deepening of these relationships, the new loans we have originated for these customers has, on average, been greater than their PPP loans. 
Regarding the 14,700 new-to-bank customers, 30% are now actively using their DDA account, and we are seeing good initial loan activity with these small businesses as well. Although we know that we will not be able to retain all of these clients, we are pleased with these early results.  
Finally, it's our observation that many small businesses have been resourceful in building liquidity. And it would appear that a number of these small businesses still have a significant amount of their original PPP loan funding available in their deposit accounts. This should represent a real source of financial strength as we continue to navigate the pandemic. 
Finally, advancing to Slide 10. 2020 has been a very successful year in our history for our mortgage banking group, driven in no small part by the rollout of our Zip Mortgage digital, customer-facing application process, which occurred prior to the significant decline in interest rates and the significant increase in mortgage originations in the country. The combination of these 2 factors, among others, led to a substantial increase in mortgage banking revenue, with loan sales revenue increasing to $54 million from approximately $17 million in 2019. That's $54 million for the full year of 2020 versus $17 million in 2019. This new process has also allowed us to reduce our turn times by 25% and improved our service levels. Originations exceeded $800 million in -- for 3 quarters. And our pipeline at the beginning of 2021 is higher than the year ago level by 66%.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Paul for remarks on credit and additional detail on our financial performance and condition. Paul?"
315476,674970605,2176079,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin my comments on Slide 11. Generally, we have presented the credit quality ratios in our earnings presentation materials excluding PPP loans. As Harris noted, classified loans a",1895,"Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin my comments on Slide 11. Generally, we have presented the credit quality ratios in our earnings presentation materials excluding PPP loans. As Harris noted, classified loans and nonperforming loans were somewhat stable with the prior quarter. Overall net charge-offs were 13 basis points and, for the year, just 22 basis points. About 4/5 of the fourth quarter and 1/3 of the full year net charge-offs were attributable to the oil and gas portfolio. Consistent with our credit loss allowance of $104 million against that portfolio, we do expect energy loan charge-offs in the future. However, with the improvement in commodity prices and some of the restructurings that have taken place, our credit loss reserve on this portfolio reflects an improving outlook. 
On the left side of Slide 12, we engaged very early in granting payment deferrals and payment modifications to our borrowers as the pandemic worsened. At December 31, loans on payment deferral status were 0.5% of non-PPP loans. The right side of this page shows loans that are over 90 days past due. Please note at the bottom of these bars are statistics regarding total loans that are delinquent by 90 days or more and still accruing. This has recently remained relatively steady between 2 to 3 basis points of non-PPP loans. 
Advancing to Slide 13. The industries represented here are those which we believe to have the greatest risk of default in the current environment. As shown on the right side of the page, the collateral coverage is excellent for these $4 billion of loans, with 98% being covered by collateral often by real estate. Within these loans collateralized by real estate, the median loan-to-value ratio is 53%, and only 3% of these loans have LTV ratios greater than 90%. 
Slide 14 presents the 3 groupings highlighted on the previous slide in a time-series format. The top-left chart shows the loan balances in columns with the weighted average risk rate shown in the 3 lines. As indicated by the lines, the elevated risk portfolio experienced some risk-grade improvement since September, as did the remaining portfolio excluding oil and gas lending. The oil and gas portfolio's weighted average risk grade remained relatively unchanged. The loan grade shown here represent the probability of default only. As a reminder, the probability of default combined with the loss given default are key drivers of the allowance for credit loss. 
The top-right chart on Slide 14 shows the trend in classified and nonaccrual loans with the classified ratio being the larger number and the nonaccrual ratio being the smaller number within each bar. The relative stability of the other loans' nonaccrual ratio, which represents 87% of the total non-PP (sic) [ non-PPP ] loan portfolio is encouraging in the current economic environment. On the bottom right, you can see the net charge-offs related to these groups. The oil and gas portfolio accounted for about 4/5 of the quarter's total net charge-offs, while a very small amount of net charge-offs came from the elevated risk portfolio.  
Slide 15 details our allowance for credit losses, or ACL. On the top left, you can see the recent trend. The total ACL was $835 million at December 31 or 1.74% of non-PPP loans. On the right side, we describe the factors leading to the ACL change in the most recent quarter. 
The bar chart on the bottom right shows the broad categories of change. $3 million of the ACL decrease is due to the net impact of changes in economic forecast and changes in the probability weightings of those forecasts. Credit quality factors, represented by the middle bar, include risk grade migration and specific reserves against loans, which combined for a $20 million reduction in the ACL when compared to the prior quarter. Finally, portfolio changes driven by the aging of the portfolio, the shift in the portfolio from segments that have higher ACLs, such as consumer mortgages and oil and gas and toward segments that have lower ACL, allowance for credit losses, attached to them such as municipal lending and other similar factors, generated a $59 million reduction in the ACL. 
Slide 16 shows an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows recent trends in both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has compressed in the current quarter relative to the prior quarter. However, as shown on the chart on the right, the compression is essentially attributable to the composition of earning assets, namely a greater concentration of lower-yielding money market and investment securities. The change in the composition of earning assets has been driven by the strong growth in deposits. Average deposits increased $1.8 billion, while average loans, including PPP, declined by $1 billion. As a result, average money market investments and securities increased $3.1 billion when compared to the prior quarter. 
Slide 17 highlights loan and deposit growth and breaks them down by both rate and volume. As shown on the left side of the chart, average non-PPP loans were lower by about $600 million, while period-end non-PPP loans were down by only about $30 million. Average PPP loans declined $1 billion, while period-end PPP loans declined $1.2 billion. PPP forgiveness reduced PPP loan balances in the quarter, and this is expected to continue into 2021. 
Turning to yield on loans. The overall yield increased 3 basis points from the prior quarter. The increase in PPP loan yield from 3.50% -- to 3.50% from 3.03% in the prior quarter is an important factor in the overall loan yield. PPP loans account for nearly 12% of average loans, meaning that a 47 basis point differential or increase in the PPP loan yield added about 5 basis points to the total loan yield. Partially offsetting that positive change, the yield on new loan production, including line draws, was modestly lower than the yield on maturing loans and paydowns. This trend remained consistent with the third quarter. The resulting yield on non-PPP loans decreased about 3 basis points from the prior quarter. 
Shifting to the chart on the right and funding, average total deposits increased 2.7% over the prior quarter. The cost of deposits declined to 8 basis points from 11 basis points in the prior quarter. 
Slide 18 reports that our balance sheet sensitivity has increased as deposits have increased and benchmark interest rates have fallen. We are comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we believe the risk to lower rates is limited. As we indicated in October and as you can see in the balance sheet tables in the press release, we deployed some of the increase in deposits into securities. The securities purchases for the quarter had an average yield of about 1.25%. The purchase activity helps to offset some of the deposit fuel growth in asset sensitivity, but the absolute level of asset sensitivity is still unusually high relative to our long-term history. 
The charts on the right side of the page -- that's Page 18, show the interest rate risk -- sorry, the interest rate reset profile of our loan portfolio and include additional detail on the interest rate swap book. On the upper right, the volumes, maturities and associated fixed rates for swaps used to hedge our floating rate loans are shown, while the bottom right highlights loan repricing characteristics. 
On Slide 19, consumer-related fees were stable with the prior quarter at $139 million. Mortgage loan sale revenue declined $8 million and was offset by broad-based improvement in several other categories, including interest rate swap sales revenue, which is found in the capital markets and foreign exchange line as well as wealth management fees and retail fees. 
Noninterest expense, shown on Slide 20, was $424 million in the fourth quarter. After normalizing for the $30 million charitable contribution in the prior quarter, the $12 million increase in noninterest expense included an increase in incentive compensation as credit quality and overall profitability was better than had been expected earlier in the year. Total compensation and benefits for the full year, excluding severance, was $28 million less in -- than in 2019 or 2.5% lower. Average full-time equivalent employees declined about 4.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019, while period-end full-time equivalent employees declined nearly 6%. 
Helping to drive these savings are continued efforts to streamline and simplify our operations where possible, which has been enabled in part by our investments in technology as an example of that can be seen in the application of automation in our workspace. Our technology and operations group has been able to incrementally automate an estimated 285,000 hours of labor in 2020, a significant savings for our organization. 
We also reported an increase in our professional and legal services expense. About $3 million of that increase was related to forgiveness, the forgiveness process for PPP Round 1 loans. The remainder of the increase can largely be attributed to ongoing technology initiatives. 
We are reintroducing our financial outlook, which we suspended for much of 2020 due to the extreme uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Our updated outlook can be found on Page 21 and is our best general estimate of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020's actual results. Quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and I would reiterate our earlier reference to the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. 
We are establishing our loan growth outlook, which excludes PPP loans, at slightly increasing, which can be interpreted as a growth rate in the low single digits. We expect low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in commercial, driven by an expectation for continued solid growth in municipal lending. We expect commercial real estate to be relatively stable, and we expect consumer lending to experience low single-digit growth. 
We are establishing our outlook for net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, at slightly increasing, which incorporates the current shape of the yield curve, some earning asset growth and some modest pressure on the net interest margin as the securities portfolio yield continues to reset lower and we experience modest pressure on loan yields. 
We are establishing our outlook for customer-related fees at slightly increasing. Mortgage banking income may be subject to some weakness if longer-term interest rates rise, but we expect strength from many other revenue categories especially as we deepen and strengthen relationships with our PPP customers.
We are establishing our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense at generally stable. As noted on the comments section on this page, on a GAAP basis, we expect the overall level of GAAP noninterest expense in 2021 to be consistent with GAAP noninterest expense for 2020 at about $1.7 billion.
Finally, regarding capital management, we feel very good about the strength of our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.8%, particularly when paired with the relatively low credit losses and relatively stable pre-provision net revenue throughout the pandemic.
It is premature to announce any share repurchase program today. However, we have said that as uncertainty subsides, the prospects of actively managing our capital through share repurchase improves. Of course, the approval of any repurchase program is subject to approval by our Board of Directors and our regulators.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Andrew, would you please open the line for questions?"

And what we're trying to say is that what we're continuing to see is similar to that in terms of that quantification, but we haven't been super specific about what that is. But I think it's a fair word, modest.
The -- as it relates to securities growth, we're being -- we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet today. You saw that impact our net interest margin. We are working -- the whole finance team, the treasury team are working really hard to sort of actively manage that cash, but we also are mindful of a view that the economy could really begin to engage in the second half of the year. And so we're -- given the very flat nature of the yield curve and, I would say, a general expectation internally that things will really improve as we -- or start to really improve as we get into the next half of this year. We want to be careful about putting on too much duration with that incremental cash that's been added. So the securities -- it's a long way of saying the securities portfolio may grow, but you won't see it grow anywhere close to the amount of excess cash that's been put out over the course of the last quarter."

I'll speak to the first part of that. I think -- well, maybe all of it. The energy outstandings are actually about -- well, I'm not sure how we reflected it here, but there's about $100 million of PPP loans in the energy outstandings. And so excluding PPP, energy outstandings are around $2.1 billion or so. And that could go down a little bit further, but I do think if oil and gas prices stay where they are and maintain some stability there, I think you're going to see increased drilling and you'll see greater utilization of lines of credit.
So I don't anticipate -- it could go down the next quarter or 2, some, but I think we'll start to see utilization pick up. And I do think that for small business lending in general, the -- our borrowers, they are building liquidity. We've seen that. I think we've seen it across the country. And they still have a healthy proportion of their PPP fundings to rely on as well. So I think it's going to be the broader economy starting to show real improvement, and we'll start to see lines of credit being utilized at a greater pace as working capital builds up again and as people start to adjust to the post-pandemic environment."

But absent the energy charge-offs, it looks truly great.
And then you have -- I don't expect we're going to see huge loan demands. We expect that we're going to see loans growing but probably not at a pace that's going to absorb a lot of earnings.

And to the extent we've got fixed rate loans, that could sort of happen around that part, too. So it's hard for me to be really specific around what that looks like. Although I wouldn't target it to the 10-year, I would probably target it to sort of the 3- to 5-year part of the curve."

This is -- we know these -- we can count these customers in ones, not in hundreds and thousands. We're keeping track of the calling effort on them through our contact management system. Our CEOs and our bankers are highly focused on it. And so it's hard to know where it will end up, but we're encouraged by the early loan growth and new services growth that we see there.
And -- but I'd tell you it's always more fun to talk about kind of new customers. It's a little sexier. But the approximately 33,000 existing customers, we probably didn't have that close a relationship with some of those. And so this gave us a chance to have a really intimate experience with them, and we're seeing a nice pickup in loans and other services and just the strengthening of the relationship there.

But to your point, the hard part will be the second round of PPP and sort of how fast those come on the books and then to the extent that borrowers meet the threshold, how quickly those are forgiven by the SBA. That is a lot murkier to me. 
But all that being said, I think 2021 will be -- for the next several quarters at least, significantly -- net interest income will be significantly impacted by the existence of the PPP program. And your math is approximately right. I came up with a slightly different answer when I did this a couple of weeks ago. If you look at the yield, $6.3 billion and 3.5% yield for a full year, that's $220 million. And so divide that by 4 and it's like $55 million associated with PPP."

Beginning on Slide 3 of the presentation that we distributed, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front. Diluted earnings p",925,"Thanks very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call this evening. Beginning on Slide 3 of the presentation that we distributed, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.90 from $1.66 per share in the prior quarter. The increase can be attributed to the change in the provision for credit losses. This reserve release, which was almost double the size of the release in the prior quarter, was made possible by the combination of a low 7 basis points of annualized loan losses relative to average non-PPP loans, 6 basis points on total loans -- total average loans. And it's also the result of continued improvement in the economic outlook. 
Our capital improved with common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increasing about 40 basis points to 11.2%. Period-end loans were flat with the prior quarter, helped by additional growth in PPP loans from the 2021 round of the program. When viewed through the lens of Federal Reserve H8 data and from other reporting banks' recent earnings releases, it appears that we held up better than a great many banks, viewed both with and without the effect of PPP loans. Period-end deposits increased 6% or 24% annualized and noninterest-bearing deposits increased more than 10% or 42% annualized. 
Slide 4 reflects recent earnings per share results, along with some notable items on the right-hand side of the chart of the slide there that may be of interest to you. 
And then turning to Slide 5, adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $253 million in the first quarter. The decrease from the prior quarter was largely, although not entirely, attributable to seasonal factors such as reduced revenue from fewer days in the quarter and increased expense, primarily from an increase in long-term incentive compensation. We've also displayed the provision for credit losses, which has been the most volatile component of our earnings. Paul Burdiss will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks about some of these items. 
On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. They're very strong results over the past 2 quarters in large measure, reflect the partial reversal of credit loss provisions in the first 2 quarters of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 7, we highlight the increase in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which as I noted, increased more than 11% from 10% a year ago. Much of this is attributable to the fact that we suspended share repurchases during the most the most uncertain period of the pandemic while maintaining our common stock cash dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our stock. And although it's premature to announce anything today, the company is well positioned to be more active in our capital management over the next several months, we believe. 
Slide 8 highlights our Paycheck Protection Program lending success. We've been very pleased with the results of our efforts, ranking tenth overall in origination volume when combining last and this year's results. We are well into the forgiveness process with $4.4 billion of applications received and $2.8 billion approved by the SBA. During the first quarter, an additional $1.5 billion was forgiven by the SBA, a slight increase over the prior quarter's rate, leading to a moderate increase in the yield of those loans. The 2021 round has been a continued success, although fewer of our borrowers have needed the funds, still, of the more than 28,000 applications submitted in the current round, nearly 4,000 of the applications are from customers that are new to the bank in the current round, in addition to the nearly 15,000 new customers from the 2020 applicants. 
Turning to Slide 9, we can see the status of customers that as a result of the PPP, are new to the bank as well as those who were existing customers who obtained a PPP loan from us. We have an active calling program that is designed to introduce these customers to our frontline bankers, who then can assess the customers' financial services needs and offer products and services that might be a good fit for their business. As shown in the chart on the right, these customers have added various products and services outside of their PPP loan and related deposit account. We are encouraged by the progress we are making on this front and look forward to more progress in the months and quarters ahead. 
As we enter 2021, I'm encouraged with the progress made on the technology front that has enabled us to do things faster and at lower cost. We are currently rolling out our new front-end online and mobile banking platform for consumers. And in 2023, we expect to complete the transition to our new core deposit system. Chair Jelena McWilliams of the FDIC recently noted, ""I would say that if we could scratch every legacy computer system and start anew, that would be wonderful."" Although we've not replaced every legacy system, we've come a long way, and we believe we're doing some really leading work there. We're further along in the process than any of our peers that we're aware of. We expect this will give us a long-term competitive advantage in staying relevant and allowing us to be nimble and fast in adopting new technologies from vendors and ultimately making the experience for the customer very user-friendly. 
I'll now turn the time over to Paul Burdiss, our CFO, to provide some additional detail on our financial results. Paul?"

I'll begin my comments on Slide 10 with average loans and deposits. Loan growth has been elusive for banks recently and our first quarter results are consistent with that trend. As shown on the left side of t",1801,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 10 with average loans and deposits. Loan growth has been elusive for banks recently and our first quarter results are consistent with that trend. As shown on the left side of the page, average total loans were nearly flat in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. The same is true for period-end loans. Excluding PPP loans, average loans are essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and are down $1.3 billion or approximately 2.5% from the prior quarter. Incidentally, the majority of the loan declines that we've seen have been in revolving lines of credit, which is consistent with the deposit growth we've seen, and I'll describe that in a few moments. 
Within the loan portfolio, average non-PPP C&I loans are down $149 million or about 0.5% from the prior quarter and down $782 million or 3% from the year ago period. Average consumer loans are down $403 million or 3.6% from the prior quarter and are down $1.1 billion or 9% from the prior year period. Consumer loans are down in each category, most notably in residential mortgages as refinancing activity has added to fee income while reducing outstanding loans on our books. The notable increases came from PPP loans, municipal lending and commercial real estate. 
While credit trends are generally improving across the portfolio, the credit quality in our municipal lending portfolio continues to stand out as being exceptional. The increase in PPP loans reflected the production of $2.6 billion of round 2021 loans, partially offset by $1.6 billion round 2020 PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns, netting growth of nearly $900 million between the first and the fourth quarter period end. As Harris noted earlier, we're particularly pleased with being able to assist and support so many thousands of small businesses in obtaining the government stimulus money through our internally developed, simple, easy, fast and safe process. 
Turning to deposits on the right side of this page, average deposits increased 4.7% from the prior quarter, while period-end deposits increased at a moderately stronger pace. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased over 25%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased at a slightly stronger pace in both the quarter and year-over-year comparison. And at this point, our average noninterest-bearing deposits are 47% of total average deposits, up from a ratio in the low 40s prior to 2020. This mix shift has provided support to our net interest margin, although noninterest-bearing deposits are not as valuable when interest rates are low. 
Before I advance to the next slide, I will highlight loan and deposit yields. The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined slightly to 3.69% from 3.74%. As noted in the press release financial, the yield on new loan production is moderately lower than the loans rolling off. And the dilution is generally consistent with the levels we've seen in prior quarters. There remains continued pressure on pricing in most of our markets, which is what one would expect given the significant increase in liquidity throughout our banking system. Deposit yields continue to be very well behaved as our cost of total deposits have fallen to 5 basis points in the first quarter. 
On Slide 11, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. You'll notice we increased the size of the period-end securities portfolio by about $2.4 billion over the past year to $17.2 billion, while money market investments increased $7.9 billion to $9.7 billion, which is 12% of earning assets. The growth in cash is attributable in part to the forgiveness of PPP loans; the origination of new PPP loans where the proceeds have not been -- have been placed into a deposit account and have not yet been used by our customers; and general increases in the liquidity of our customers. We continue to grow our investment portfolio at a measured pace during the first quarter, reflecting unprecedented growth in deposits and helped by the steepening of the yield curve. As the longevity of recently-added deposits remain uncertain, we will exercise extra caution and will likely hold more in money market investments than we would at times of greater certainty. 
Slide 12 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend in both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting both falling rates and rising excess liquidity. Notably, average deposit growth has exceeded average loan growth by $10 billion over the past year. This growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right, as strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments. In the current quarter, the effect of lower rates and a greater concentration of cash and securities drove 9 basis points of linked quarter net interest margin compression, with excess cash driving 8 of those 9 basis points. 
Slide 13 has a lot of information about our interest rate sensitivity, but I'll focus on the upper left quadrant. If you compare this to our prior iterations of this page, you'll note that our asset sensitivity has increased as deposits have increased. This, of course, assumes that the incremental deposits have similar duration characteristics as the deposits on our balance sheet prior to the recent deposit surge. Understanding this is one of the greater challenges we currently face when determining the appropriate mix of security to cash. We are generally comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we believe the risk to lower rates is somewhat limited, and the durability of recent deposit growth remains uncertain. As previously indicated, we deployed some of the increase in deposits into securities, security purchases for the quarter had an average yield of about 1.3%. 
On Slide 14, customer-related fees declined modestly in the quarter to $133 million. Relative to the prior quarter, capital markets activity is somewhat weaker, principally due to fewer interest rate swap sales and syndication fees. Several fee income categories were fairly stable compared to the prior quarter, such as commercial account fees and most of the items within retail and business banking, the exception being nonsufficient fund fees. Wealth management fees continue to grow and are now being reported on a separate line item. 
Noninterest expense, shown on Slide 15, was $435 million in the first quarter, up from $11 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense was up $17 million to $440 million. The quarter-over-quarter adjusted noninterest expense increase can largely be broken down as follows: additions of $10 million for seasonal equity grants to retirement-eligible employees; $9 million for profit sharing and seasonal matching contributions to employee 401(k) accounts; and an incremental $5 million associated with PPP loan forgiveness. These additions were partially offset by a decrease in base salaries of $10 million. 
A review of credit quality and credit expense begins on Slide 16. Building upon comments from Harris earlier, we saw meaningful improvements in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs when compared with the prior quarter. Not shown here is the criticized loan level, which includes both classified loans and special mention loans. That balance declined 7% from the prior quarter. Overall net charge-offs were 7 basis points in the first quarter, declining from 13 basis points in the prior quarter. I think that is worth repeating. Net charge-offs were $8 million in the first quarter or 7 basis points of average non-PPP loans. 
Slide 17 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. On the top left, you can see the recent declining trend in our ACL to $695 million at March 31 or 1.48% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right side of this page shows that $110 million of the $140 million change in the ACL quarter-over-quarter, was driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. We expect that future changes to the ACL will be driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as loan portfolio, credit performance and growth. 
Our outlook can be found on Slide 18. As a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to the forward-looking statement on Page 2. Our loan growth outlook, which excludes PPP loans is somewhat uncertain. While our bankers are expressing optimism, the unprecedented level of government stimulus is almost certainly having an adverse impact on the need for credit, particularly among our Main Street borrowers. On balance, we are reasonably comfortable reiterating our slightly increasing outlook, which can be interpreted as non-PPP loan growth in the low single digits. We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase slightly with the deployment of cash into securities and the slight growth in non-PPP loans, partially offset by moderate compression of loan yields. We had established our outlook at slightly increasing for customer-related fees in January, and we are increasing that to moderately increasing. We believe an improvement in economic activity should help to increase card and small business-related fees as well as loan syndication and other commercial lending-related fees, and that wealth management will continue the trend of double-digit growth and that mortgage banking revenues will remain generally stable at the current level. 
I also have a bit of late-breaking news. Based upon current market conditions, we believe that we will recognize a second quarter gain in our SBIC investment portfolio of over $25 million. We will have more to disclose when we file our 10-Q in a few weeks. We are making a slight change to our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense moving to stable to slightly increasing from generally stable. We will remain disciplined on expense control, but as business activity and profitability increases, expenses may increase. This outlook does not reflect a significant change in inflation from the last several years, which we believe may be a risk to this outlook. Finally, regarding capital management, we feel good about the strength of our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 11.2%, particularly in the context of excellent credit performance and the results of our internal stress testing. As we consider the balance of risk and capital, we believe there may be room for more active capital management in the near to medium term, so long as the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue or improve. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Valerie, would you please open the line for questions?"

I think you touched on this very briefly, but in terms of the net interest income, stable to slightly increasing. Can you just break that out a little bit in terms of how much of that is driven by core balance sheet growth versus PPP runoff over time versus core NIM compression versus the accelerated fee income that you're getting from the PPP, if that's possible? Just it sounds like some of the core parts are a little bit weaker and that this might be being held up by PPP, but just unsure."

So what we tried to do is provide an outlook that excludes PPP and the reason for that is exactly what you described, that PPP is absolutely augmenting current levels of net interest income. But because of forgiveness and other factors, can be somewhat volatile. And so the outlook that we provided was really meant to speak to the underlying trends in net interest income, which are going to be defined by what's happening on our core balance sheet, that is loan and deposit growth and then also the absolute level of rates. 
We believe, as activity improves, we're going to, as we say, in the loan growth outlook, which also excludes PPP loans, we are expecting some level of economic activity to translate to increased loan growth over the course of the next year. We think that will be additive. And then there's also an expectation that interest rates and/or the yield curve may continue to steepen over the course of the year, which we think would also be additive."

That's really where we're focused in revenue and net interest income.  But margin is being significantly impacted by all the cash we have on the balance sheet, as I said, loan growth or deposit growth exceeded loan growth by $10 billion over the course of the last year. And on our balance sheet, that's significant. Of the approximately 55 basis points of margin compression we've experienced over the last year, about half of that is related to an increase in cash balances. So that is to say the underlying trend on the margin isn't nearly as bad, I will say, as the headline outcome. And in fact, given what rates have done and how much they've fallen, I feel pretty good about where our margin is. 
So looking ahead, again, trying to exclude PPP because of the volatility, our expectation is that we will see a little loan growth, and that is helpful from a volume perspective on net interest income. And then also, to the extent the yield curve steepens a little bit from here, which is possible, we think that would also be additive. So it's really those pieces of the core net interest income reflected in the net interest margin that we're focused on."

And so it feels to me like we're getting a little further away from that sort of pure media and performance or peer median level that we think is important relative to the risk on our balance sheet. So over the sort of medium term, John, I think that's -- that might be a decent yardstick, but I'll let Harris provide a few comments."

One, on the traditional securities, as I tried to lay out in the prepared comments, we're really -- we're not going crazy in terms of adding either volume or duration there. We're really sticking to our knitting and sort of incrementally adding. So the real opportunity to sort of change interest sensitivity is really on the interest rate swap side, sort of the synthetic extension of duration with swaps, which is what your question keys on. I will say, as the curve has steepened, we, the ALCO Committee, have discussed the maturity profile of the swaps and sort of the duration that's created by that. And we are incrementally adding to that. 
And so in terms of activity, when I think about balancing the duration of the assets and liabilities, We are going to be much more focused on the swap side, to the extent that yield curve remains somewhat attractive. I think that's -- the uncertain part -- the reason I pause is the uncertain part is again, I tried to say in my prepared remarks, what we don't know is what the sort of real average life or duration of the surge in deposits has been or will be, right? So we've got this incremental $10 billion of deposit growth in excess of loan growth. That's creating a lot of interest sensitivity in our models. But as managers, the ALCO job is to look at that with some level of skepticism. And that's what we're doing. So We're marginally adding duration, either in portfolio size or interest rate swaps, but we haven't added a lot yet. Looking ahead, I would look for more activity in swaps than securities."

And the good news is that they're doing that. But that does create some incremental expense as we are contributing to that. So there's almost $6 million of year-over-year change, just in those, what I'll characterize as 401(k) related items, between the profit sharing and the profit sharing in the 401(k) match. 
And then the other big piece is really in what we call our value-sharing plan. So this is kind of a 3-year -- it's a -- if you look at our proxy statement, you can see how it's calculated, it's a very quantitatively derived 3-year and therefore, somewhat long-term incentive compensation program. And this is really largely our financial performance relative to peers. And what we saw this year in the first quarter was that the financial performance looks much better this year than it did a year ago, with all of the uncertainty related to the pandemic. And so there were increases in accruals associated with those long-term incentive plans. Those are the key drivers really year-over-year."

So our nonrevolving credits are basically stable with where they were a year ago, which I think is a strength. And if you look through the PPP borrowers specifically, the new loans that we've generated with those borrowers, they represent about 10% of what the existing companies were borrowing pre-pandemic. So we're seeing nice volume there, as you noted. 
So I think we're -- we have a much more kind of positive outlook than we had maybe 3 to 4 months ago, but it's just a big ship to turn. And once it turns, I think we'll -- we should expect to be back in the mid-single-digit loan growth process, which is where we were for a number of years."

The issue that Paul spoke about with respect to all liquidity, I do think is an issue and a headwind.

But I think we're interested across the board in commercial. Commercial real estate, we're trying to be a little more careful there because of some of the well understood challenges with respect -- in retail, CRE and office.

Beginning on Slide 3 of the presentation that we distributed, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front. Diluted earnings p",926,"Thanks very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call this evening. Beginning on Slide 3 of the presentation that we distributed, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.90 from $1.66 per share in the prior quarter. The increase can be attributed to the change in the provision for credit losses. This reserve release, which is almost double the size of the release in the prior quarter, was made possible by the combination of a low 7 basis points of annualized loan losses relative to average non-PPP loans, 6 basis points on total loans -- total average loans. And it's also the result of continued improvement in the economic outlook.
Our capital improved with common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increasing about 40 basis points to 11.2%. Period-end loans were flat with the prior quarter, helped by additional growth in PPP loans from the 2021 round of the program. When viewed through the lens of Federal Reserve H.8 data and from other reporting banks' recent earnings releases, it appears that we held up better than a great many banks, viewed both with and without the effect of PPP loans. Period-end deposits increased 6% or 24% annualized, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased more than 10% or 42% annualized.
Slide 4 reflects recent earnings per share results, along with some notable items on the right-hand side of the chart there -- of the slide there that may be of interest to you.
And then turning to Slide 5, adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $253 million in the first quarter. The decrease from the prior quarter was largely, although not entirely, attributable to seasonal factors such as reduced revenue from fewer days in the quarter and increased expense, primarily from an increase in long-term incentive compensation. We've also displayed the provision for credit losses, which has been the most volatile component of our earnings. Paul Burdiss will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks about some of these items.
On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. They're very strong results over the past 2 quarters, in large measure, reflect the partial reversal of credit loss provisions in the first 2 quarters of 2020.
Turning to Slide 7, we highlight the increase in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which, as I noted, increased more than 11% from 10% a year ago. Much of this is attributable to the fact that we suspended share repurchases during the most uncertain period of the pandemic while maintaining our common stock cash dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our stock. And although it's premature to announce anything today, the company is well positioned to be more active in our capital management over the next several months, we believe.
Slide 8 highlights our Paycheck Protection Program lending success. We've been very pleased with the results of our efforts, ranking tenth overall in origination volume when combining last and this year's results. We are well into the forgiveness process with $4.4 billion of applications received and $2.8 billion approved by the SBA. During the first quarter, an additional $1.5 billion was forgiven by the SBA, a slight increase over the prior quarter's rate, leading to a moderate increase in the yield of those loans. The 2021 round has been a continued success, although fewer of our borrowers have needed the funds. Still, of the more than 28,000 applications submitted in the current round, nearly 4,000 of the applications are from customers that are new to the bank in the current round, in addition to the nearly 15,000 new customers from the 2020 applicants.
Turning to Slide 9, we can see the status of customers that, as a result of the PPP, are new to the bank as well as those who were existing customers who obtained a PPP loan from us. We have an active calling program that is designed to introduce these customers to our frontline bankers, who then can assess the customers' financial services needs and offer products and services that might be a good fit for their business. As shown in the chart on the right, these customers have added various products and services outside of their PPP loan and related deposit account. We are encouraged by the progress we are making on this front and look forward to more progress in the months and quarters ahead.
As we enter 2021, I'm encouraged with the progress made on the technology front that has enabled us to do things faster and at a lower cost. We are currently rolling out our new front-end online and mobile banking platform for consumers. And in 2023, we expect to complete the transition to our new core deposit system. Chair Jelena McWilliams of the FDIC recently noted, ""I would say that if we could scratch every legacy computer system and start anew, that would be wonderful."" Although we've not replaced every legacy system, we've come a long way, and we believe we're doing some really leading work there. We're further along in the process than any of our peers that we're aware of.

315476,700635344,2253373,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 10 with average loans and deposits. Loan growth has been elusive for banks recently, and our first quarter results are consistent with that trend. As shown on the left side of",1800,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 10 with average loans and deposits. Loan growth has been elusive for banks recently, and our first quarter results are consistent with that trend. As shown on the left side of the page, average total loans were nearly flat in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. The same is true for period-end loans. Excluding PPP loans, average loans are essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and are down $1.3 billion or approximately 2.5% from the prior quarter.
Incidentally, the majority of the loan declines that we've seen have been in revolving lines of credit, which is consistent with the deposit growth we've seen, and I'll describe that in a few moments. Within the loan portfolio, average non-PPP C&I loans are down $149 million or about 0.5% from the prior quarter and down $782 million or 3% from the year ago period. Average consumer loans are down $403 million or 3.6% from the prior quarter and are down $1.1 billion or 9% from the prior year period. Consumer loans are down in each category, most notably in residential mortgages as refinancing activity has added to fee income while reducing outstanding loans on our books. The notable increases came from PPP loans, municipal lending and commercial real estate.  
While credit trends are generally improving across the portfolio, the credit quality in our municipal lending portfolio continues to stand out as being exceptional. The increase in PPP loans reflected the production of $2.6 billion of round 2021 loans, partially offset by $1.6 billion round 2020 PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns, netting growth of nearly $900 million between the first and the fourth quarter period end. As Harris noted earlier, we're particularly pleased with being able to assist and support so many thousands of small businesses in obtaining the government stimulus money through our internally developed, simple, easy, fast and safe process.
Turning to deposits on the right side of this page, average deposits increased 4.7% from the prior quarter, while period-end deposits increased at a moderately stronger pace. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased over 25%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased at a slightly stronger pace in both the quarter and year-over-year comparison. And at this point, our average noninterest-bearing deposits are 47% of total average deposits, up from a ratio in the low 40s prior to 2020. This mix shift has provided support to our net interest margin, although noninterest-bearing deposits are not as valuable when interest rates are low.
Before I advance to the next slide, I will highlight loan and deposit yields. The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined slightly to 3.69% from 3.74%. As noted in the press release financial, the yield on new loan production is moderately lower than the loans rolling off. And the dilution is generally consistent with the levels we've seen in prior quarters. There remains continued pressure on pricing in most of our markets, which is what one would expect given the significant increase in liquidity throughout our banking system. Deposit yields continue to be very well behaved as our cost of total deposits have fallen to 5 basis points in the first quarter. 
On Slide 11, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. You'll notice we increased the size of the period-end securities portfolio by about $2.4 billion over the past year to $17.2 billion, while money market investments increased $7.9 billion to $9.7 billion, which is 12% of earning assets. The growth in cash is attributable in part to the forgiveness of PPP loans, the origination of new PPP loans where the proceeds have not been -- have been placed into a deposit account and have not yet been used by our customers and general increases in the liquidity of our customers. We continue to grow our investment portfolio at a measured pace during the first quarter, reflecting unprecedented growth in deposits and helped by the steepening of the yield curve. As the longevity of recently-added deposits remain uncertain, we will exercise extra caution and will likely hold more in money market investments than we would at times of greater certainty.
Slide 12 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend in both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting both falling rates and rising excess liquidity. Notably, average deposit growth has exceeded average loan growth by $10 billion over the past year. This growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right, as strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments. In the current quarter, the effect of lower rates and a greater concentration of cash and securities drove 9 basis points of linked quarter net interest margin compression, with excess cash driving 8 of those 9 basis points.
Slide 13 has a lot of information about our interest rate sensitivity, but I'll focus on the upper left quadrant. If you compare this to our prior iterations of this page, you'll note that our asset sensitivity has increased as deposits have increased. This, of course, assumes that the incremental deposits have similar duration characteristics as the deposits on our balance sheet prior to the recent deposit surge. Understanding this is one of the greater challenges we currently face when determining the appropriate mix of security to cash. We are generally comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we believe the risk to lower rates is somewhat limited, and the durability of recent deposit growth remains uncertain. As previously indicated, we deployed some of the increase in deposits into securities. Security purchases for the quarter had an average yield of about 1.3%.
On Slide 14, customer-related fees declined modestly in the quarter to $133 million. Relative to the prior quarter, capital markets activity is somewhat weaker, principally due to fewer interest rate swap sales and syndication fees. Several fee income categories were fairly stable compared to the prior quarter, such as commercial account fees and most of the items within retail and business banking, the exception being non-sufficient fund fees. Wealth management fees continue to grow and are now being reported on a separate line item.
Noninterest expense, shown on Slide 15, was $435 million in the first quarter, up $11 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense was up $17 million to $440 million. The quarter-over-quarter adjusted noninterest expense increase can largely be broken down as follows: additions of $10 million for seasonal equity grants to retirement-eligible employees, $9 million for profit sharing and seasonal matching contributions to employee 401(k) accounts and an incremental $5 million associated with PPP loan forgiveness. These additions were partially offset by a decrease in base salaries of $10 million.
A review of credit quality and credit expense begins on Slide 16. Building upon comments from Harris earlier, we saw meaningful improvements in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs when compared with the prior quarter. Not shown here is the criticized loan level, which includes both classified loans and special mention loans. That balance declined 7% from the prior quarter. Overall net charge-offs were 7 basis points in the first quarter, declining from 13 basis points in the prior quarter. I think that is worth repeating. Net charge-offs were $8 million in the first quarter or 7 basis points of average non-PPP loans.
Slide 17 details our allowance for credit losses, or ACL. On the top left, you can see the recent declining trend in our ACL to $695 million at March 31 or 1.48% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right side of this page shows that $110 million of the $140 million change in the ACL quarter-over-quarter, was driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. We expect that future changes to the ACL will be driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as loan portfolio, credit performance and growth.
Our outlook can be found on Slide 18. As a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to the forward-looking statement on Page 2.
Our loan growth outlook, which excludes PPP loans is somewhat uncertain. While our bankers are expressing optimism, the unprecedented level of government stimulus is almost certainly having an adverse impact on the need for credit, particularly among our Main Street borrowers. On balance, we are reasonably comfortable reiterating our slightly increasing outlook, which can be interpreted as non-PPP loan growth in the low single digits.
We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase slightly, with the deployment of cash into securities and the slight growth in non-PPP loans, partially offset by moderate compression of loan yields.
We had established our outlook at slightly increasing for customer-related fees in January, and we are increasing that to moderately increasing. We believe an improvement in economic activity should help to increase card and small business-related fees as well as loan syndication and other commercial lending-related fees. And that wealth management will continue the trend of double-digit growth, and that mortgage banking revenues will remain generally stable at the current level.
I also have a bit of late-breaking news. Based upon current market conditions, we believe that we will recognize a second quarter gain in our SBIC investment portfolio of over $25 million. We will have more to disclose when we file our 10-Q in a few weeks.
We are making a slight change to our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense moving to stable to slightly increasing from generally stable. We will remain disciplined on expense control, but as business activity and profitability increases, expenses may increase. This outlook does not reflect a significant change in inflation from the last several years, which we believe may be a risk to this outlook.
Finally, regarding capital management, we feel good about the strength of our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 11.2%, particularly in the context of excellent credit performance and the results of our internal stress testing. As we consider the balance of risk and capital, we believe there may be room for more active capital management in the near to medium term, so long as the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue or improve.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Valerie, would you please open the line for questions?"

I think you touched on this very briefly, but in terms of the net interest income, stable to slightly increasing, can you just break that out a little bit in terms of how much of that is driven by core balance sheet growth versus PPP runoff over time versus core NIM compression versus the accelerated fee income that you're getting from the PPP, if that's possible? Just it sounds like some of the core parts are a little bit weaker and that this might be being held up by PPP, but just unsure."

So what we tried to do is provide an outlook that excludes PPP. And the reason for that is exactly what you described that PPP is absolutely augmenting current levels of net interest income. But because of forgiveness and other factors can be somewhat volatile. And so the outlook that we provided was really meant to speak to the underlying trends in net interest income, which are going to be defined by what's happening on our core balance sheet, that is loan and deposit growth and then also the absolute level of rates.
We believe, as activity improves, we're going to, as we say in the loan growth outlook, which also excludes PPP loans, we are expecting some level of economic activity to translate to increased loan growth over the course of the next year. We think that will be additive. And then there's also an expectation that interest rates and/or the yield curve may continue to steepen over the course of the year, which we think would also be additive."

That's really where we're focused in revenue and net interest income.  But margin is being significantly impacted by all the cash we have on the balance sheet. As I said, loan growth -- or deposit growth exceeded loan growth by $10 billion over the course of the last year. And on our balance sheet, that's significant. Of the approximately 55 basis points of margin compression we've experienced over the last year, about half of that is related to an increase in cash balances. So that is to say the underlying trend on the margin isn't nearly as bad, I will say, as the headline outcome. And in fact, given what rates have done and how much they've fallen, I feel pretty good about where our margin is.
So looking ahead, again, trying to exclude PPP because of the volatility, our expectation is that we will see a little loan growth, and that is helpful from a volume perspective on net interest income. And then also, to the extent the yield curve steepens a little bit from here, which is possible, we think that would also be additive. So it's really those pieces of the core net interest income reflected in the net interest margin that we're focused on."

And so as you can see that despite the pandemic, we have significantly grown our CET1 ratio over the last year. In fact, our CET1 is up 120 basis points from 10% to 11.2%.
And so it feels to me like we're getting a little further away from that sort of peer median performance or peer median level that we think is important relative to the risk on our balance sheet. So over the sort of medium term, John, I think that's -- that might be a decent yardstick, but I'll let Harris provide a few comments."

And so in terms of activity, when I think about balancing the duration of the assets and liabilities, we are going to be much more focused on the swap side to the extent that yield curve remains somewhat attractive. I think that's -- the uncertain part -- the reason I paused is the uncertain part is, again, I tried to say it in my prepared remarks, what we don't know is what the sort of real average life or duration of the surge in deposits has been or will be, right?
So we've got this incremental $10 billion of deposit growth in excess of loan growth. That's creating a lot of interest sensitivity in our models. But as managers, the ALCO's job is to look at that with some level of skepticism. And that's what we're doing. So we're marginally adding duration, either in portfolio size or interest rate swaps, but we haven't added a lot yet. Looking ahead, I would look for more activity in swaps than securities."

So the issue that we had, let's say, 6 months ago, about kind of trying to put on some protection against lower rates was, one, we didn't think the rates were much lower or could go much lower; and two, we weren't getting paid at all for adding that duration. Now there is a -- we're getting paid a little bit for, if you will, every duration dollar that we're putting on, which is why we're a little more active.

And the good news is that they're doing that. But that does create some incremental expense as we are contributing to that. So there's almost $6 million of year-over-year change, just in those, what I'll characterize as 401(k)-related items between the profit sharing and the profit sharing in the 401(k) match.
And then the other big piece is really in what we call our value-sharing plan. So this is kind of a 3-year -- it's a -- if you look at our proxy statement, you can see how it's calculated. It's a very quantitatively derived 3-year and therefore, somewhat long-term incentive compensation program. And this is really largely our financial performance relative to peers. And what we saw this year in the first quarter was that the financial performance looks much better this year than it did a year ago, with all of the uncertainty related to the pandemic. And so there were increases in accruals associated with those long-term incentive plans. Those are the key drivers, really, year-over-year."

So our nonrevolving credits are basically stable with where they were a year ago, which I think is a strength. And if you look through the PPP borrowers specifically, the new loans that we've generated with those borrowers, they represent about 10% of what the existing companies were borrowing pre-pandemic. So we're seeing nice volume there, as you noted.
So I think we're -- we have a much more kind of positive outlook than we had maybe 3 to 4 months ago, but it's just a big ship to turn. And once it turns, I think we'll -- we should expect to be back in the mid-single-digit loan growth process, which is where we were for a number of years."

So -- but nonetheless, we -- it's not like we're doing nothing. I mean we have added to the portfolio.

So I'm not sure on balance that it was significantly different than otherwise would have been.
And then I think it would be somewhat speculative to start getting into what's happening in the second, third or fourth quarters, which is why we've tried to provide an outlook that excludes the impact of PPP, because it's really hard to predict. It's not up to us. You know what I mean? And so as a result, it's a little hard to predict.

I'm going to start on Slide 3.

I'm going to start on Slide 3. We are really pleased with the overall results for the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front, where we experienced net recoveries of previously charged-off loans. We saw loan activity, excluding PPP loans that was more encouraging, and we've become somewhat more optimistic about the loan growth prospects for the future. 
We accelerated the purchases of securities during the quarter, resulting in linked-quarter growth in that portfolio on an amount was roughly double that of the prior quarter. We plan to continue that pace in the near term. Deposit growth was strong with essentially all of the growth coming from noninterest-bearing deposits. And despite the increase in securities purchases, our money market investments increased relative to total assets. We continue to streamline the organization, allowing operational expense to remain relatively flat. 
Finally, we are very pleased with the advancement in our technology platform, having rolled out a new consumer interface, both mobile and in online banking, which has materially increased the functionality of our consumer digital banking platform. 
Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.08 per share from $1.90 in the prior quarter. More than $120 million of our allowance for credit loss was released due to improved confidence in the economic outlook. The strong credit quality outperformance relative to expectations boosted returns -- boosted earnings rather, in turn boosted our capital ratios. Those capital ratios are now particularly strong relative to our risk profile. 
Earnings were also bolstered by a substantial net unrealized gain on an SBIC investments that went public during the quarter. We were encouraged with the relative stability of our non-PPP loans, which declined only 0.1% from the prior quarter. Examining the 3 major loan categories, our non-PPP commercial loans increased about 0.8%, which is roughly in line with the Federal Reserve's H8 data on commercial loans when excluding PPP loans. 
We continue to exercise caution as commercial real estate loans and several other property types. As such, that category only increased 0.4%. Our consumer portfolio equals about 20% of total loans and is made up primarily of residential mortgages, which declined 3.1% from the prior quarter, although it's notable that the rate of attrition in that portfolio slowed as the quarter progressed. 
Period-end deposits increased 3% or $2.3 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for a remarkable 99.7% of that increase. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our deposits have increased more than $16 billion, which is equivalent to the deposits held at our largest affiliate bank prior to the pandemic. Appropriately managing that magnitude of influx in just 18 months has been one of our highest priorities, which Paul will be addressing in his remarks. 
Going to Slide 4. It reflects recent earnings per share results, along with some notable items on the right that may be of interest. As previously noted, $0.25 per share in the current quarter is the after-tax recognized net gain from an investment in a small business investment company fund. One of the companies within the fund, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, underwent an IPO in April, which we described in our first quarter 10-Q. Additionally, although not shown on the page, the per share value of the reserve release was $0.56. 
On Slide 5, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The very strong results were attributable to items that I previously described. As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 6. We continue to see improvements in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs when compared with the prior quarter. Although not shown, special mention loans declined 26% from the compared quarter and the classified loan balance declined 6%. Overall, we experienced net loan recoveries of 2 basis points of non-PPP loans in the second quarter, declining from 7 basis points of net loan charge-offs in the first quarter. Shown on the chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the relative stability of net charge-offs. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our capital levels increased significantly during the pandemic. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.3% from 10% at the beginning of the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases during the most uncertain period of the pandemic while maintaining our common stock cash dividend. We resumed buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing $50 million of our stock. We increased the amount of buybacks to $100 million in the second quarter. Although it's premature to announce anything today, the company is well positioned to be more active in our capital management. 
I'm now going to turn the time over to Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who's going to update you on the PP program and our technology initiatives. Scott?"

Turning to Slide 8. As a precursor to discussing the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP loans, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million in the second quarter. This is net of the effects of t",798,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening to everyone. Turning to Slide 8. As a precursor to discussing the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP loans, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million in the second quarter. This is net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. You'll notice that the bar is leading to 2 portions. The bottom portion of the bar represents what we think of as generally recurring income, while the top portion of the bar denotes the PPNR we've received from PPP loans. 
Of course, we recognize that income from this source will decline. Nevertheless, our ability to outperform by a factor of 3x the industry origination of PPP loans has resulted in significant benefits to our communities as well as hundreds of thousands of individuals and families. Of course, our earnings from the PPP program have bolstered profitability during the pandemic and produce capital that ultimately benefits our shareholders. PPNR from the program has equaled $262 million so far, and there remains $137 million in capitalized income that will be realized over time. 
Turning to Slides 9 and 10, these highlights our oversized performance, noting that we ran tenth overall in origination volume of PPP loans when combining both years' results. were energized to rise to the challenge of making a difference in our communities during the pandemic. Regarding forgiveness, we're well into the process with $6 billion of applications received and $5.3 billion approved by the SBA. That leaves $4.5 billion of PPP loans on our balance sheet at quarter end. During the second quarter, an additional $2.4 billion was forgiven by the SBA, a moderate increase over the prior quarter's rate, leading to a moderate increase in the yield of the PPP loans. 
Turning to Slide 10. Having noted the positive earnings impact a moment ago, this slide reflects the longer-term lasting benefit. Specifically, as a result of the laser focus of our bankers calling efforts, you see growing relationships with all 77,000 PPP recipients. These customers collectively have also contributed significantly to our deposit growth during the pandemic. More specifically, of the round one 14,000 new-to-bank customers, over 50% now appear to be utilizing us for their operating accounts, a percentage that is growing nicely each quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, and I believe at least a handful of you on this call have followed us for more than 2 decades, you'll know that we are committed to complementing our competitive advantage as a relationship-oriented bank by enabling our customers to do business faster and more simply through technology. Many years ago, Zions pioneered remote deposit capture, which literally required an active Congress to enable us to provide the service to customers. Today, we continue to be encouraged with the progress made on the technology front. This year, we rolled out our new online and mobile banking system to 650,000 consumers, which was very well received by customers, and this implementation went quite well given the size of it. 
By early 2022, we will do the same, roll out online and mobile capabilities, additional capabilities to 150,000 of our business customers. In 2023, we expect to complete the multiphase transition to our modern core system. As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement of our 3 core loan systems, and now have virtually all of our loans on our modern core utilizing one data model. While we will continue to provide more details on this competitive advantage, very simply, this means that unlike all other U.S. banks, we will have a modern core operating system that greatly reduces the complexity of aging legacy industry infrastructure. 
Specifically, let me just highlight a few things that you really need to know. This core architecture is real-time, parameter-driven, API-enabled, cloud compatible, includes higher degrees of cyber resiliency and will be far more agile as we create new products and capabilities in the future. It operates with one data model, a key to being successful in the digital world. It is capable of 7-day processing. So when the U.S. market adopts this international capability and standard, it will dramatically improve how we protect and utilize customer attribute data. Additionally, we'll unify the customer account opening process at our branches and online as well as being far more user-friendly for our employees. 
As you know, this core transformation journey has been the catalyst for simplification and modernization throughout the company and sets us up to optimize our investment as we further automate the interface between systems in the back and front office and back and front office processes. 
I'll now turn the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail on our financial condition. Paul?"
315476,700635450,2347742,"Zions Bancorporation, National Association, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Zions Bancorporation, National Association","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. More than 3/4 of our revenue is net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit balances and growth. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 12 with a review of those 2 categories.",1645,"Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. More than 3/4 of our revenue is net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit balances and growth. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 12 with a review of those 2 categories. 
While average loans were down in the second quarter by nearly 2% when compared to the first quarter, we are starting to see slight improvement in our C&I, owner-occupied, home equity and our bank card portfolios. Excluding PPP loans, average loans were down 1% from the prior quarter and down $2.4 billion or approximately 5% from the prior year period. As Harris noted earlier, and it's worth repeating, period-end loans, excluding PPP loans, were essentially flat from the first quarter. 
Within the loan portfolio, average non-PPP commercial loans were down $172 million or less than 1% from the prior quarter, while period-end commercial loans increased nearly 1%. Within the commercial real estate category, construction and land development loans increased on a period-end basis by 5.4% compared to the prior quarter and term CRE declined less than 1%. Overall, the total commercial real estate portfolio grew 0.4% when compared to the prior quarter. 
Average consumer loans declined $437 million or 4.1% from the prior quarter. Unlike last quarter, when consumer loans were down in each category, in the second quarter, we saw growth in 3 categories: home equity, construction and other commercial real estate and bank card. We saw a 5.4% decline in residential mortgages when compared to the prior quarter due to continued refinancing activity, although the attrition rate slowed as the quarter progressed. And in the PPP loan portfolio, we continue to see paydowns and process forgiveness totaling $2.4 billion in the quarter. The average balance of PPP loans decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter. 
One final note on loan growth. Relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization has declined several percentage points to about 34% from about 39%. Based upon the amount of revolving loan commitments, that difference explains about $1.7 billion or nearly all of the decline in non-PPP loan balances during the last 18 months. After several quarters of decline in utilization, we did see a slight uptick in utilization in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. 
Deposits have been the driver of the growth of the balance sheet over the past several quarters. On the right side of this page, average deposits increased 4.5% from the prior quarter, while period-end deposits increased 3%. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 18%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 8% over the prior quarter and 26% compared to the prior year period. Our average noninterest-bearing deposits are now 49% on of average total deposits and at period end, they had reached 50%. 
The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the 4.56% yield on the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 2 basis points to 3.67% from 3.69% as we continue to see some pressure on pricing in most of our markets, attributable, we believe, to the surplus liquidity in the marketplace. Deposit costs are low. Our cost of total deposits fell to 4 basis points in the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by about $4 billion over the past year to $19 billion, while money market investments increased $10 billion to $11.8 billion, which is now 14% of earning assets. As Harris noted earlier, we accelerated the growth of the securities portfolio in the second quarter, adding just under $1.2 billion on average to the available-for-sale portfolio. 
We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively short final maturities and keeping an eye on the duration in an upward shock scenario. In fact, we estimate that the duration of our available-for-sale securities book would extend by less than 1.5 a year in a parallel 200 basis point upward shock. 
Slide 14 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity. Average deposit growth has exceeded average loan growth by $13 billion over the past year. For the second quarter, this growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right, as the strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments. 
In the current quarter, the effect of a greater concentration of money market investments drove 7 basis points of linked quarter net interest margin compression, with the slightly dilutive effects from securities being offset by a lower cost from interest-bearing deposits. 
Slide 15 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left-hand quadrant, our asset sensitivity has increased as noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth is funding an increase in short-term investments. We are generally comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we still believe the risk to lower rates is limited.  The duration of recent deposit growth remains uncertain and adding asset duration is  relative to the interest rate risk profile. As we previously mentioned, we are marginally adding duration by increasing the size of the investment securities and interest rate swaps portfolio. The $2.7 billion of securities purchases for the quarter had an average yield of 1.65%. 
On Slide 16, customer-related fees increased 5% in the quarter to $139 million. Notably, activity-based fees such as card fee and merchant services did well. Card income increased 15% over the prior quarter due to increased customer activity and spending. Additionally, capital markets activity was stronger, principally from loan syndication fees and wealth management fees maintained their strong pace when compared to the prior year. 
Noninterest expense shown on Slide 17 was down 2% to $428 million in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense was down 5% or $21 million to $419 million. The decrease in adjusted noninterest expense was primarily from lower seasonal employee compensation and benefits expense and lower professional services associated with PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted noninterest expense also excludes the $9 million success fee accrual associated with the Recursion Pharmaceuticals IPO. 
Slide 18 details our allowance for credit losses, or ACL. In the upper left, we show the recent declining trend in the ACL to $574 million at the end of the second quarter or 1.22% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right of this page shows that $103 million of the $122 million decline in the ACL was driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast. 
Our updated outlook can be found on Slide 19. As a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. Due to the degree of uncertainty and the timing of customers submitting requests and the SBA approving those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans. 
On the commercial loan front, our bankers are expressing optimism and we are just starting to see green shoots of loan growth. However, loan payoff activity is also increasing as relatively strong valuations are leading to increased business sale activity. We are not expecting a lot of growth in commercial real estate. And consumer loans, again, dominated by mortgages are likely to be slow to grow as long as the yield curve remains flat and the 30-year conforming mortgages are more appealing and adjustable jumbo mortgages. Putting it all together, we are somewhat more optimistic about loan growth now than we were in April. And as such, we are modestly increasing our outlook to slightly to moderately increasing from slightly increasing. 
We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase moderately over the next year. We expect this to be the result of continued slight compression of loan and securities yields which will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into term securities and a somewhat more favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans. 
We reiterate our outlook for customer-related fees at moderately increasing. We have started to see an improvement in economic activity, translating to increases in card and small business-related fees as well as loan syndication and other commercial lending-related fees. We expect that wealth management revenue will continue its double-digit growth trend and mortgage banking revenue should remain generally stable. 
Adjusted noninterest expense improved from the prior quarter. And we expect that noninterest expense will increase slightly by the second quarter of 2022 from the $419 million reported in the quarter just ended. We remain disciplined on expense control, but as business activity and profitability increases, expenses may increase. Reiterating my disclaimer from our April call, this outlook does not reflect a significant change in inflation from what we've observed over the past several years, which we believe is an emerging and increasingly important risk to our outlook. 
Finally, regarding capital management, echoing Harris' comments, we have a very strong common equity Tier 1 ratio now at 11.3%, particularly in the context of excellent credit performance and the results of our internal stress testing. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we believe there is room for more active capital management in the near to medium term along with the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue to be favorable. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Christian, would you please open the line for questions?"

Scott did a nice job of explaining how the new depositors that are coming into the bank were really trying to integrate them and make them as sticky as possible. 
And as a result, it feels like this balance sheet growth is a little more permanent than I would have speculated a year ago. And what all of that means is that, yes, we can be a little more confident in how we're investing that cash. So that's part of it. But the other is, as I said, there are some green shoots to loan growth, which is highly speculative and a lot of things can change in the next year. But generally speaking, the optimism in our footprint really feels like it's improving. And so there's an element of a little bit of kind of core balance sheet growth in that outlook as well."

One of the things we said throughout the last couple of quarters is when your portfolio is declining, you need to first reach a couple of flat quarters before you can start to project increases. Even though a lot of our peers project increases in the second half of the year. I think we're just pleased that here in the second quarter, we've seen a flattening. We're not experiencing the same declines, and I think that gives us optimism that we can start to move from that with growth. 
We're clearly seeing more greater activity in all of our client bases. One of the biggest things that I think will drive loan growth will just be as our small- and medium-sized businesses rebuild their working capital positions. They all collectively pulled back really hard on their investment in inventory and certainly receivables. And with the inflationary pressures, supply chain pressures, you're seeing businesses lean heavily into rebuilding inventory again as their sales are increasing. And so this should lead to some additional utilization -- increase in utilization, which we are at historic levels -- historically low levels as Paul noted. 
The other thing I would comment on is that we are very actively positioning our owner-occupied financings and HELOC financings throughout the late spring and the summer months and fall months here because those 2 products are directly aimed at our primary client base, and we think with the right structure, there's a lot of potential demand there."

And the only reason there's an increase in '23 is that when you put a major system into production, it pulls forward a lot of expenses in that year. And then there's about a 20% falloff in that related cost in the following year. So there'll be a 1-year kind of increase in '23. And then just the question is, how do we divert those now available technology dollars to other technologies? I'm not sure we'll have to divert all of them to other technologies, but the demand for technology spend will probably always continue to be very high.

Let me put a finer point on this core transformation expense thought. I was talking about it kind of elliptically and I'll put a finer point on it and then toss the ball to Paul or Harris if they want to talk a longer-term efficiency ratio. But what I basically said was that our expenses for Future Core, our core transformation project, basically would be -- they're in the range of about $45 million in 2020, 2021, and there will be a little less than that in 2022. So around that number, in terms of P&L impact. And that number will go up into the low 50s in 2023 when we bring the system online. And then in the following year, it will drop by about $7 million, $8 million. So those are the kind of swings we're talking about. They're not big dramatic swings, but they do free up dollars once we get past 2023. 
And in terms of the timing in 2023,  it's not one big conversion as we bring all of our affiliates onto the deposit system. It's multiple conversions, and it will take place throughout the year. But by the time we get to the second half of '23, we should be we should be clear saving."

And that had just so changes the picture in terms of efficiency ratio that I think in the current rate environment, M&A remains what we've seen over the last 3 months, 6 months for a very long period of time. I think it's going to be tough to be under we're probably kind of low 60s. I hope we're low 60s. But with some with some movement, I personally am a belief that this inflation is not just transitory. 
I mean we're seeing it in -- and it also gets an efficiency ratio. I mean we're seeing it in terms of wage pressures. So we're trying to fill up in positions. I mean it's a really competitive labor market right now. And -- we're seeing -- I heard this morning an employee that got a call was hired without an interview for about a 50% increase in pay and stuff like that starting to go on. I think that what we're going to see personally is sustained -- a sustained period of inflation that's going to lead to higher rates and it's going to produce better margins, kind of produce other kinds of problems along with it. But I think that it's, in my mind, unlikely that we're going to see this rate environment last for a very long time. But I -- if it does, I think it's going to be tough. If it doesn't, I think we'll see ourselves back into the 50s in a sort of a more normal rate environment, I think we'd be down probably in the mid- to low 50s.

One, I would say our deposit growth relative to average deposit growth looks pretty good. That is to say it feels like our deposit growth is a little stronger. Some of that's from new customers, some of it is from existing customers. But we do a lot of analytics. We were part of the sort of the CCAR and LCR world for a while. And so all of those things that we developed, we still utilize to run the business and run the bank. 
And so part of that development on liquidity stress testing was really good insights into the operating nature of our customer accounts. And what we're seeing is new customers are using their accounts in an operating way and existing customers are continuing and are building their use of their deposit accounts in an operating way. And what that means is is that they just feel more sticky. So I would have guessed and did a year ago that deposits that were generated through the PPP program because as a reminder, all of those PPP fundings had to occur on our balance sheet, right? We put them into a deposit account drawn on our bank. And I expected that those funds would be largely spent. In a relatively short amount of time, what we found is that our customers are far more resilient frankly, than I gave them credit for. And that's been a really great credit story as they've learned to balance out their cash flows in the way they run their business. But it's also been a really good liquidity story because all of this money that I expected to be utilized in the business ended up sort of staying on the balance sheet. 
And as a result, over time, here we are a year later and deposits are much higher than they were when I was originally kind of speculating on that. So it's a long way of saying that sort of over time and experience and with some real analytics on -- looking at the sort of operating statistics that are underlying the deposits, we are just gaining more confidence that those deposits are going to be around longer than we originally thought."

I'm going to start on Slide 3. We are really pleased with the overall results for the quarter, particularly on the credit quality front where we experienced net recoveries of previously charged-off loans. We saw loan activity, excluding PPP loans, that was more encouraging, and we've become somewhat more optimistic about the loan growth prospects for the future.
We accelerated the purchases of securities during the quarter, resulting in linked-quarter growth. That portfolio on an amount was roughly double that of the prior quarter. We plan to continue that pace in the near term. Deposit growth was strong with essentially all of the growth coming from noninterest-bearing deposits. And despite the increase in securities purchases, our money market investments increased relative to total assets. We continue to streamline the organization, allowing operational expense to remain relatively flat.
Finally, we are very pleased with the advancement in our technology platform, having rolled out a new consumer interface, both mobile and online banking, which has materially increased the functionality of our consumer digital banking platform.
Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.08 per share from $1.90 in the prior quarter. More than $120 million of our allowance for credit loss was released due to improved confidence in the economic outlook. The strong credit quality outperformance relative to expectations boosted returns -- or boosted earnings, rather, and in turn, boosted our capital ratios. Those capital ratios are now particularly strong relative to our risk profile.
Earnings were also bolstered by a substantial net unrealized gain on an SBIC investment that went public during the quarter. We were encouraged with the relative stability of our non-PPP loans, which declined only 0.1% from the prior quarter. Examining the 3 major loan categories, our non-PPP commercial loans increased about 0.8%, which is roughly in line with the Federal Reserve's H8 data on commercial loans when excluding PPP loans.
We continue to exercise cautions with commercial real estate loans and several other property types. As such, that category only increased 0.4%. Our consumer portfolio equals about 20% of total loans and is made up primarily of residential mortgages, which declined 3.1% from the prior quarter, although it's notable that the rate of attrition in that portfolio slowed as the quarter progressed.
Period-end deposits increased 3% or $2.3 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for a remarkable 99.7% of that increase. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our deposits have increased more than $16 billion, which is equivalent to the deposits held at our largest affiliate bank prior to the pandemic. Appropriately managing that magnitude of influx in just 18 months has been one of our highest priorities, which Paul will be addressing in his remarks.
Going to Slide 4. It reflects recent earnings per share results, along with some notable items on the right that may be of interest. As previously noted, $0.25 per share in the current quarter is the after-tax recognized net gain from an investment in a small business investment company fund. One of the companies within the fund, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, underwent an IPO in April, which we described in our first quarter 10-Q. Additionally, although not shown on the page, the per share value of the reserve release was $0.56.
On Slide 5, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The very strong results were attributable to items that I previously described.
As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 6. We continue to see improvements in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs when compared with the prior quarter. Although not shown, special mention loans declined 26% from the comparable quarter, and the classified loan balance declined 6%. Overall, we experienced net loan recoveries of 2 basis points of non-PPP loans in the second quarter, declining from 7 basis points of net loan charge-offs in the first quarter.
Shown in the chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the relative stability of net charge-offs.
Turning to Slide 7. Our capital levels increased significantly during the pandemic. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.3% from 10% at the beginning of the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases during the most uncertain period of the pandemic while maintaining our common stock cash dividend.
We resumed buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing $50 million of our stock. We increased the amount of buybacks to $100 million in the second quarter. Although it's premature to announce anything today, the company is well positioned to be more active in our capital management.
I'm now going to turn the time over to Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who's going to update you on the PP Program and our technology initiatives. Scott?"

Turning to Slide 8. As a precursor to discussing the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loans, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million in the second quarter. This is net of the effects of",801,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening to everyone. Turning to Slide 8. As a precursor to discussing the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loans, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million in the second quarter. This is net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. You'll notice that the bar is split into 2 portions. The bottom portion of the bar represents what we think of as generally recurring income, while the top portion of the bar denotes the PPNR we've received from PPP loans.
Of course, we recognize that income from this source will decline. Nevertheless, our ability to outperform by a factor of 3x the industry origination of PPP loans has resulted in significant benefits to our communities as well as hundreds of thousands of individuals and families. Of course, our earnings from the PPP program have bolstered profitability during the pandemic and produced capital that ultimately benefits our shareholders. PPNR from the program has equaled $262 million so far, and there remains $137 million in capitalized income that will be realized over time.
Turning to Slides 9 and 10, these highlight our oversized performance, noting that we ranked tenth overall in origination volume of PPP loans when combining both years' results. Zions colleagues were energized to rise to the challenge of making a difference in our communities during the pandemic.
Regarding forgiveness, we're well into the process with $6 billion of applications received and $5.3 billion approved by the SBA. That leaves $4.5 billion of PPP loans on our balance sheet at quarter end. During the second quarter, an additional $2.4 billion was forgiven by the SBA, a moderate increase over the prior quarter's rate, leading to a moderate increase in the yield of the PPP loans.
Turning to Slide 10. Having noted the positive earnings impact a moment ago, this slide reflects the longer-term lasting benefit. Specifically, as a result of the laser focus of our bankers calling efforts, you see growing relationships with all 77,000 PPP recipients. These customers collectively have also contributed significantly to our deposit growth during the pandemic. More specifically, of the Round 1 14,000 new-to-bank customers, over 50% now appear to be utilizing us for their operating accounts, a percentage that is growing nicely each quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, and I believe at least a handful of you on this call have followed us for more than 2 decades, you'll know that we are committed to complementing our competitive advantage as a relationship-oriented bank by enabling our customers to do business faster and more simply through technology. Many years ago, Zions pioneered remote deposit capture, which literally required an active Congress to enable us to provide the service to customers.
Today, we continue to be encouraged with the progress made on the technology front. This year, we rolled out our new online and mobile banking system to 650,000 consumers, which was very well received by customers. And this implementation went quite well given the size of it.
By early 2022, we will do the same: roll out online and mobile capabilities, additional capabilities to 150,000 of our business customers. In 2023, we expect to complete the multiphase transition to our modern core system.
As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement of our 3 core loan systems and now have virtually all of our loans on our modern core utilizing 1 data model. While we will continue to provide more details on this competitive advantage, very simply, this means that unlike all other U.S. banks, we will have a modern core operating system that greatly reduces the complexity of aging legacy industry infrastructure.
Specifically, let me just highlight a few things that you really need to know. This core's architecture is real-time, parameter-driven, API-enabled, cloud compatible, includes higher degrees of cyber resiliency and will be far more agile as we create new products and capabilities in the future. It operates with 1 data model, a key to being successful in the digital world. It is capable of 7-day processing. So when the U.S. market adopts this international capability and standard, it will dramatically improve how we protect and utilize customer attribute data. Additionally, it will unify the customer account opening process at our branches and online as well as being far more user-friendly for our employees.
As you know, this core transformation journey has been the catalyst for simplification and modernization throughout the company and sets us up to optimize our investment as we further automate the interface between systems in the back and front office -- and back- and front-office processes.
I'll now turn the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail on our financial condition. Paul?"

More than 3/4 of our revenue is net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit balances and growth. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 12 with a review of those 2 categories.",1643,"Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. More than 3/4 of our revenue is net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit balances and growth. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 12 with a review of those 2 categories.
While average loans were down in the second quarter by nearly 2% when compared to the first quarter, we are starting to see slight improvement in our C&I, owner-occupied, home equity and our bank card portfolios. Excluding PPP loans, average loans were down 1% from the prior quarter and down $2.4 billion or approximately 5% from the prior year period. As Harris noted earlier, and it's worth repeating, period-end loans, excluding PPP loans, were essentially flat from the first quarter.
Within the loan portfolio, average non-PPP commercial loans were down $172 million or less than 1% from the prior quarter, while period-end commercial loans increased nearly 1%. Within the commercial real estate category, construction and land development loans increased on a period-end basis by 5.4% compared to the prior quarter and term CRE declined less than 1%. Overall, the total commercial real estate portfolio grew 0.4% when compared to the prior quarter.
Average consumer loans declined $437 million or 4.1% from the prior quarter. Unlike last quarter when consumer loans were down in each category, in the second quarter, we saw growth in 3 categories: home equity, construction and other commercial real estate and bank card. We saw a 5.4% decline in residential mortgages when compared to the prior quarter due to continued refinancing activity, although the attrition rate slowed as the quarter progressed. And in the PPP loan portfolio, we continue to see paydowns and process forgiveness totaling $2.4 billion in the quarter. The average balance of PPP loans decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter.
One final note on loan growth. Relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization has declined several percentage points to about 34% from about 39%. Based upon the amount of revolving loan commitments, that difference explains about $1.7 billion or nearly all of the decline in non-PPP loan balances during the last 18 months. After several quarters of decline in utilization, we did see a slight uptick in utilization in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.
Deposits have been the driver of the growth of the balance sheet over the past several quarters. On the right side of this page, average deposits increased 4.5% from the prior quarter, while period-end deposits increased 3%. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 18%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 8% over the prior quarter and 26% compared to the prior year period. Our average noninterest-bearing deposits are now 49% of average total deposits, and at period end, they had reached 50%.
The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the 4.56% yield on the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 2 basis points to 3.67% from 3.69% as we continue to see some pressure on pricing in most of our markets, attributable, we believe, to the surplus liquidity in the marketplace. Deposit costs are low. Our cost of total deposits fell to 4 basis points in the second quarter.
On Slide 13, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by about $4 billion over the past year to $19 billion, while money market investments increased $10 billion to $11.8 billion, which is now 14% of earning assets. As Harris noted earlier, we accelerated the growth of the securities portfolio in the second quarter, adding just under $1.2 billion on average to the available-for-sale portfolio.
We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively short final maturities and keeping an eye on the duration in an upward shock scenario. In fact, we estimate that the duration of our available-for-sale securities book would extend by less than 1/2 a year in a parallel 200-basis-point upward shock.
Slide 14 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity. Average deposit growth has exceeded average loan growth by $13 billion over the past year. For the second quarter, this growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right, as the strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments.
In the current quarter, the effect of a greater concentration of money market investments drove 7 basis points of linked-quarter net interest margin compression, with the slightly dilutive effects from securities being offset by a lower cost from interest-bearing deposits.
Slide 15 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left-hand quadrant, our asset sensitivity has increased as noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth is funding an increase in short-term investments. We are generally comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we still believe the risk to lower rates is limited. The duration of recent deposit growth remains uncertain, and adding asset duration is less appealing relative to the interest rate risk profile. As we previously mentioned, we are marginally adding duration by increasing the size of the investment securities in interest rate swaps portfolio. The $2.7 billion of securities purchases for the quarter had an average yield of 1.65%.
On Slide 16, customer-related fees increased 5% in the quarter to $139 million. Notably, activity-based fees such as card fee and merchant services, did well. Card income increased 15% over the prior quarter due to increased customer activity and spending. Additionally, capital markets activity was stronger, principally from loan syndication fees, and wealth management fees maintained their strong pace when compared to the prior year.
Noninterest expense shown on Slide 17 was down 2% to $428 million in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense was down 5% or $21 million to $419 million. The decrease in adjusted noninterest expense was primarily from lower seasonal employee compensation and benefits expense and lower professional services associated with PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted noninterest expense also excludes the $9 million success fee accrual associated with the Recursion Pharmaceuticals' IPO.
Slide 18 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. In the upper left, we show the recent declining trend in the ACL to $574 million at the end of the second quarter or 1.22% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right of this page shows that $103 million of the $122 million decline in the ACL was driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast.
Updated outlook can be found on Slide 19. As a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. Due to the degree of uncertainty and the timing of customers submitting requests and the SBA approving those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans.
On the commercial loan front, our bankers are expressing optimism, and we are just starting to see green shoots of loan growth. However, loan payoff activity is also increasing as relatively strong valuations are leading to increased business sale activity. We are not expecting a lot of growth in commercial real estate. And consumer loans, again, dominated by mortgages, are likely to be slow to grow as long as the yield curve remains flat and the 30-year conforming mortgages are more appealing and adjustable jumbo mortgages.
Putting it all together, we are somewhat more optimistic about loan growth now than we were in April. And as such, we are modestly increasing our outlook to slightly -- to moderately increasing from slightly increasing.
We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase moderately over the next year. We expect this to be the result of continued slight compression of loan and securities yields, which will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into term securities and a somewhat more favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans.
We reiterate our outlook for customer-related fees at moderately increasing. We have started to see an improvement in economic activity, translating to increases in card and small business-related fees as well as loan syndication and other commercial lending-related fees. We expect that wealth management revenue will continue its double-digit growth trend and mortgage banking revenue should remain generally stable.
Adjusted noninterest expense improved from the prior quarter. And we expect that noninterest expense will increase slightly by the second quarter of 2022 from the $419 million reported in the quarter just ended. We remain disciplined on expense control. But as business activity and profitability increases, expenses may increase. Reiterating my disclaimer from our April call, this outlook does not reflect a significant change in inflation from what we've observed over the past several years, which we believe is an emerging and increasingly important risk to our outlook.
Finally, regarding capital management, echoing Harris' comments, we have a very strong Common Equity Tier 1 ratio now at 11.3%, particularly in the context of excellent credit performance and the results of our internal stress testing. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we believe there is room for more active capital management in the near to medium term, along with the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue to be favorable.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Christian, would you please open the line for questions?"

As you know, the balance sheet is a pretty complicated thing. But one of the things that we are observing, and I would say, particularly versus a year ago, gaining confidence in is sort of the stickiness of the deposits that are showing up on our balance sheet and all of the relationships that go along with those. Scott did a nice job of explaining how the new depositors that are coming into the bank were really trying to integrate them and make them as sticky as possible.
And as a result, it feels like this balance sheet growth is a little more permanent than I would have speculated a year ago. And what all of that means is that, yes, we can be a little more confident in how we're investing that cash. So that's part of it. But the other is, as I said, there are some green shoots to loan growth, which is highly speculative, and a lot of things can change in the next year. But generally speaking, the optimism in our footprint really feels like it's improving. And so there's an element of a little bit of kind of core balance sheet growth in that outlook as well."

One of the things we said throughout the last couple of quarters is when your portfolio is declining, you need to first reach a couple of flat quarters before you can start to project increases. Even though a lot of our peers project increases in the second half of the year, I think we're just pleased that here in the second quarter, we've seen a flattening. We're not experiencing the same declines, and I think that gives us optimism that we can start to move from that with growth.
We're clearly seeing more greater -- greater activity in all of our client bases. One of the biggest things that I think will drive loan growth will just be as our small- and medium-sized businesses rebuild their working capital positions. They all collectively pulled back really hard on their investment in inventory and certainly, receivables. And with the inflationary pressures, supply chain pressures, you're seeing businesses lean heavily into rebuilding inventory again as their sales are increasing. And so this should lead to some additional utilization -- increase in utilization, which we are at historic levels -- historically low levels, as Paul noted.
The other thing I would comment on is that we are very actively positioning our owner-occupied financings and HELOC financings throughout the late spring and the summer months and fall months here because those 2 products are directly aimed at our primary client base, and we think with the right structure, there's a lot of potential demand there."

But in 2023, when we go live with our deposit application, that's where we'll see a little bit of a bump-up to be followed quickly on '24 by a pretty nice drop-off.
So all in all, expenses related to technology and FutureCore specifically should be very manageable in 2022. And the only reason there's an increase in '23 is that when you put a major system into production, it pulls forward a lot of expenses in that year. And then there's about a 20% falloff in that related cost in the following year. So there'll be a 1-year kind of increase in '23.
And then just the question is, how do we divert those now available technology dollars to other technologies? I'm not sure we'll have to divert all of them to other technologies, but the demand for technology spend will probably always continue to be very high. But we certainly will be passed the elephant in the room, which is paying for a completely new core system, something the rest of the industry in its entirety has in front of it."

In terms of adding, as I noted, we added, I think, pretty significantly in the securities portfolio. We have been growing that over the course of last year by several billion dollars. I think we're going to continue to grow that. And then, we're also paying a lot of attention to swaps. We've put on $0.5 billion of notional value of swaps in the last quarter. These are forward-starting swaps, and the yield curve has got to kind of a level that we are a little more comfortable with. It's backed off away from that now.

So around that number, in terms of P&L impact. And that number will go up into the low 50s in 2023 when we bring the system online.

This is Paul. I'll start with that. The -- under CECL, the allowance for credit losses is so heavily dependent on the economic outlook that -- you've got the 2 main factors of the size and underlying risk in the portfolio and then the economic outlook. And what we saw this quarter was another release that was based largely on a very quickly improving economic outlook. And it is a kind of a complicated STU that we have to build every quarter. So it would be very, very speculative, I think, to say that we could get a lot lower or even go up from here just because we just don't know. There are so many assumptions that go into it.
It's -- I know it's a really weak probably answer relative to what you're looking for. But the honest answer is, is that from quarter-to-quarter, we don't know until we get there. And then we assess the risk at the end of the quarter, and we fill the allowance sort of loan by loan from the bottom up."

One, I would say our deposit growth relative to average deposit growth looks pretty good. That is to say it feels like our deposit growth is a little stronger. Some of that's from new customers. Some of it's from existing customers. But we do a lot of analytics. We were a part of the sort of the CCAR and LCR world for a while. And so all of those things that we developed, we still utilize to run the business and run the bank.
And so part of that development on liquidity stress testing was really good insights into the operating nature of our customer accounts. And what we're seeing is new customers are using their accounts in an operating way, and existing customers are continuing and are building their use of their deposit accounts in an operating way.
And what that means is that they just feel more sticky. So I would have guessed and did a year ago that deposits that were generated through the PPP program because, as a reminder, all of those PPP fundings had to occur on our balance sheet, right? We put them into a deposit account drawn on our bank. And I expected that those funds would be largely spent in a relatively short amount of time.
But what we found is that our customers are far more resilient, frankly, than I gave them credit for. And that's been a really great credit story as they've learned to balance out their cash flows in the way they run their business. But it's also been a really good liquidity story because all of this money that I expected to be utilized in the business ended up sort of staying on the balance sheet.
And as a result, over time, here we are a year later and deposits are much higher than they were when I was originally kind of speculating on that. So it's a long way of saying that sort of over time and experience and with some real analytics on -- looking at the sort of operating statistics that are underlying the deposits, we are just gaining more confidence that those deposits are going to be around longer than we originally thought."

And the answer is that it's a little bit dependent upon the nature of the risk of the assets that we're putting on. So for example, right now, we've got a lot of PPP loans, which we see as having little to no credit risk and a lot of, basically, overnight investments, which have little to no credit risk. And as a result, I think our philosophy around capitalization is that we have to hold capital that's commensurate with the risk in the balance sheet. That's true for the risk-adjusted ratios, and it's true for the leverage ratio.

We are seeing continued stro",1123,"Thanks very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to our call. Beginning on Slide 3, the themes that are particularly applicable to Zions, both recently as well as we believe in the near-term horizon, are listed here. We are seeing continued strong deposit growth, continued in the third quarter. And it's positioned Zions well relevant to many of our peers to be able to invest in securities and offer promotions on loan products and core customer segments. 
Secondly, for more than a decade, we worked to position the company to perform very well during an economic downturn. We are really pleased with the results, what you see in our credit outcomes again this quarter. 
Third, we, along with most in the industry, have experienced net attrition of loan balances, excluding PPP loans. But over the last quarter, we started to see some new commercial loan growth, and our strong deposit growth enabled us again to launch some promotional campaigns in June that have resulted in favorable initial results. 
These customers are coming from other banks, and we've also seen new demand from existing customers. All of it is accretive to net interest income relative to leading liquidity and money market accounts and all of it is helpful to our goal of generating positive operating leverage. We're well positioned for rising interest rates, which is helped by strong deposit growth, but also reflects the careful deployment of liquidity during earlier more uncertain points in time. 
As the outlook becomes more certain, we have begun to deploy the liquidity into higher-yielding assets. The final item on this slide refers to our ongoing significant investment in technology, which is designed to enable Zions to remain very competitive in the future, both relative to the largest U.S. banks, with fintechs and with well-established community banks. 
Turning to Slide 4, we are pleased with the results on most fronts. Our campaigns on owner-occupied commercial loans as well as consumer home equity lines of credit resulted in strong growth in both categories, each increasing at an annualized rate exceeding 10% relative to the prior quarter. Excluding PPP loans, our period-end loans in total increased an annualized 5.6%. Deposit growth remained very strong, up an annualized 9.3%, moderately outpacing the growth in the industry, which includes all domestic commercial banks. Over the prior year, deposit growth was 16%, which compares to the industry's rate of 12%. 
It is particularly notable that credit quality continued to improve, again, reporting net loan recoveries and a nearly 30% decline in special mention loans from the prior quarter. These, along with other factors, led to a further release of loan loss reserves. 
We indicated last quarter that we would continue to increase the size of the securities portfolio at a rate greater than what we did in 2020. And in the third quarter, we increased the size of the securities portfolio by nearly $2.3 billion or 12%, and that's not annualized, that's relative to the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.45 per share from $2.08 in the prior quarter. There were 2 primary factors that accounted for the decline the change in the provision expense and the change in the gains, losses on securities. Combined, those 2 contributed about $0.76 per share less in the third quarter as compared to the second. 
One way we, and perhaps some of you, look at our earnings is to look at adjusted pre-provision net revenue, which excludes securities gains and losses, and subtracting from that actual net charge-offs. On that basis, it was unchanged relative to the prior quarter of $290 million. 
Turning to Slide 5. At the top left is the chart of our recent earnings per share results. The chart on the bottom left shows the per share amount for the provision for credit losses during that same period. The provision effect on earnings per share was quite variable throughout the pandemic and is a major factor in the linked quarter decline in earnings per share. 
On the right side are some notable items that may be of interest. As previously noted, unrealized losses from securities left a partial offset from a reduced success fee accrual to the SBIC fund manager, equaled $0.12 per share as compared to unrealized gains of $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. 
Most of the recent gains and losses on securities are attributable to an investment in small business investment company fund. One of the companies within the fund successfully completed an IPO in April, which we described in our first quarter 10-Q, with a strong unrealized gain in the second quarter followed by a partial retracement in the third quarter. 
On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The healthy results were attributable to items that I previously described. As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 7. Relative to the prior quarter, we saw further improvement in [ problem loans ] using the broadest definition of problem loans, criticized and classified loans dropped more than 17%. Although not shown relative to the prior quarter, special mention loans declined at 29% and classified loans declined 10%. 
Many of you have seen our slide in the past showing our average net charge-off ratio relative to average nonperforming assets plus -- 90-plus days past due loans, which is an indicator of loss severity. In chart of this metric relative to our peers can be seen in the appendix. During the 5 years ending 2020, our average annual loss severity was 15%, while the peer median was 32%. Over the last 12 months, that ratio for Zions is just 6%. We experienced net credit recoveries on loans, which was also true in the prior quarter. 
Perhaps one of the more interesting credit measures to highlight this quarter is that gross charge-offs were very low, $8 million or just 7 basis points and annualized of average non-PPP loans. Shown on the chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the relative stability of net charge-offs. This is mostly the result of changing economic forecasts. 
Our capital position is depicted on Slide 8. We increased our share buyback to $325 million in the third quarter and have indicated that ultimately, we expect to target a common equity Tier 1 ratio at a level moderately above the peer median. We expect to announce any capital actions for the fourth quarter in conjunction with our regularly scheduled Board meeting this coming Friday. 
Next, Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, is going to provide an update on the PPP program and our technology initiatives. Scott?"

Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million, net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. The PPNR bars are split into 2 portions. The bottom portion represents what we think of as generally recurring income, while the top portion denotes the PTNR we've received from PPP loans. 
During the course of the Paycheck Protection program, our performance were producing, on a relative basis, 3x more than the industry average, will result in approximately $460 million in additional income to the company, which represents capital that ultimately benefits all shareholders. To be specific, PPP-related revenue has equaled $380 million and there remains $83 million in capitalized income, net of origination costs that will be recognized over time. Although PPP-related revenue will decline, we're enthusiastic about the longer-term benefit of adding approximately 20,000 small business customers and strengthening relationships with 57,000 existing customers. 
Turning to Slide 10, reflects some of the highlights from our 3x performance that I noted earlier. Regarding forgiveness, we've received $7.9 billion of applications or nearly 80% of the total volume; $6.7 billion has been approved for forgiveness by the SBA; and $3.1 billion of PPP loans remain on our balance sheet at quarter end. 
Turning to Slide 11, this slide illustrates the longer-term benefit of this activity, specifically as a result of our outreach. You see growing relationships with many of the 77,000 PPP participating customers. These customers collectively have contributed approximately $6 billion of our deposit growth and new non-PPP loan balances exceed $550 million to this collection of customers. More specifically, the PPP 2020 vintage, the spring 2020 vintage, 14,000 new-to-bank customers, approximately 54% are now appear to be utilizing us as their primary -- for their operating accounts. This percentage, as we've noted previously, has been growing nicely each quarter, and we are seeing similar growth trends with the PPP 2021 vintage of 5,000 new-to-bank customers, which started earlier this year. 
Turning to Slide 12, recall that in our investor presentations, we provide a detailed slide of our major technology projects. Today, we want to just highlight two. Many of you may recall, in April, FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams, was quoted as saying that her #1 concern for the banking industry was its reliance on aging core loan and deposit systems. So where do we stand on this topic? As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement of our 3 legacy core loan systems and now have virtually all of our loans on our new modern core. In 2023, we expect to complete the final phase of our core modernization journey with the conversion from our legacy deposit systems to our new enterprise core system. 
To put this in perspective, a big 4 accounting firm recently reported that of the top 100 banks in the United States, 93 remain on one or more older first generation cores, 6 are utilizing a modern core on only a portion of their loan and deposit ecosystem, and Zions is the only bank approaching the ability to utilize a modern core for the entire enterprise. Interestingly, you were starting to hear about some digital first core systems. While these provide the most advanced architectural elements available and were generally designed for digital-only banks, none have yet to be proven usable on a scale or complexity required by the largest banks. 
So why does this matter? At a high level, implementation of one core solution across all lines of business, all products and all geographies greatly reduces complexity, enhances our resiliency and creates adaptability for a rapidly changing technology environment that lies ahead. More specifically, the architecture is, as noted on this slide, parameter-driven, meaning we can quickly turn off and on or adjust features without reprogramming or testing for months. It utilizes one data model, a huge advantage in the digital world, and it is natively real-time and API-enabled. This collection of characteristics and others will greatly reduce the time it takes to introduce new products and capabilities. 
As an example, our new core was an important contributor to producing PPP revenue exceeding $460 million. Within a matter of days, we were able to introduce the PPP product and increase the number of business-related loans on our system from approximately 40,000 to over 95,000, with loan boarding occurring in minutes. Most would agree this represents a significant early return on our core replacement investment. As you talk to other banks, they will say that their older first-generation core loan and deposit systems have been adapted to mimic real time, utilize APIs and synthesize dozens of data models. Well we were doing that as well in our loan systems and continue to do that in our deposit system until we convert. 
But all of these technologies, all of these technology gymnastics that take place generally in what is referred to as middleware, absolutely introduce complexity, risk and cost. Regarding one additional highlight, I'd like to note that our core system's 7-day processing capability. Most of the world outside the United States operates on 7-day processing. When we implemented the loan portion of our new core, we adopted 7-day processing. However, as the U.S. deposit market has still not adopted 7-day processing, we chose to convert back to 5-day processing in advance of our 2023 deposit conversion. The point is that we were literally able to turn this global capability off over a weekend in August and can turn it back on when the U.S. adopts 7-day processing. This slide also conveys numerous other customer and employee-facing benefits, which I'd be happy to expand on in Q&A. 
Turning to Slide 13, my last slide. While we have been highly focused on our industry-leading work regarding core modernization, I wanted to highlight one of our numerous new customer-facing capabilities. Earlier in the year, we converted 610,000 consumers to our new online mobile platform. While time does not allow us to review all the details of this new platform, we are gratified with the early acceptance by consumers as measured by ratings in the Apple app and Google app stores. You can see that we are on par with the largest U.S. banks and are top tier with our peers. The rollout of this new online mobile system to approximately 150,000 small business clients will occur in 2022. And with this client base, we are already perceived to be on par with or superior to our global competitors. 
With that, I'll turn the remainder of the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer."

More than 3/4 of our revenue is in the form of net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit growth and associated interest rates. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 14 with a review of these results. 
Although the average total loans were down in the third quarter by 3.7% when compared to the second quarter, we experienced average loan growth when excluding PPP loans. And on a period-end basis, that growth was $661 million or 1.4%. The strongest linked-quarter growth was in commercial construction at nearly $270 million. This is the result of increased construction activity on previously established lines of credit. 
We reported strength in commercial and industrial loans, which increased more than $280 million or 2%. We ran promotions during the quarter on owner-occupied and home equity loans, which increased $215 million and $107 million, respectively. Declines were reported in PPP loans, down $1.4 billion, as Scott previously noted, and term commercial real estate, which declined more than $220 million. 
In the third quarter, we reported a more modest decline in residential mortgage balances than we have in recent quarters, down nearly $130 million. With a strong held for investment pipeline of mortgages, we may see some further stabilization or possibly growth in residential mortgages in the near term. 
One final note on loan growth, relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization has declined several percentage points. Using the third quarter of 2019 as the benchmark quarter, our revolving line utilization rate was 39.5% as compared to 33.7% in the third quarter of 2021, which was essentially from the prior quarter. Although revolving loan balances did increase from the prior quarter, up about $200 million, the lending commitments increased about $700 million. 
As I've noted in the past, deposits have been and remain the driver of balance sheet growth over the past several quarters and in the third quarter. On the right side of this page, average deposits increased 3.7% from the prior quarter. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 16%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 4.9% over the prior quarter and 24% compared to the prior year period. 
Our noninterest-bearing deposits make up 1/2 of average total deposits. The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the 6.7% yield on the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 8 basis points to 3.59% from 3.67%. Deposit costs remain low. Our cost of total deposits fell to 3 basis points in the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 15, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by nearly $6 billion over the past year to $21 billion, while money market investments increased more than $7.5 billion to $11.9 billion. 
The combination of securities and money market investments has risen to nearly 40% of total earning assets at period end, which compares to an average level in 2019 prior to the pandemic of 26%. We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively short duration, both in the current and in an upward shock -- rate shock scenario. The $3.6 billion of security purchases for the quarter had an average yield of 1.53%. 
Slide 16 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart in the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity as described on the prior page. For the third quarter, this growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right as the strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments. 
The weighted average yield of our securities and money market investments is just 1.07%. And with that concentration increasing by 4 percentage points in the quarter, it weighed on the net interest margin. In fact, I estimate that the increase in money market investments has accounted for 33 of the 45 basis point net interest margin compression over the past year. 
Slide 17 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left quadrant as a general statement, our asset sensitivity has increased as deposits have been invested in short-term money market assets. This increase in estimated rate sensitivity assumes that the incremental deposits have modestly shorter duration characteristics when compared to deposits on our balance sheet prior to the recent deposit surge. 
We are continuing to deploy deposit-driven cash into securities, which helps to moderate the natural asset sensitivity. However, with continued strong deposit growth and higher prepayment rates on mortgage loans and securities, our estimated interest rate sensitivity was similar to the second quarter level, such that in an interest rate environment that is shocked immediately 100 basis points higher than the current level, our net interest income at a 12-month horizon is estimated to be higher by 12%. As previously noted, we may continue to add interest rate swaps, including forward starting swaps, which would help to temper our natural asset sensitivity. 
On Slide 18, building on a good second quarter, customer-related fees increased an additional 9% in the third quarter to $151 million. Notably, activity-based fees such as card fees, merchant services and retail and business banking fees remain strong and have grown to the level of 2 years ago prior to the pandemic. This improvement added to continued strength in loan-related capital markets and wealth management revenues. 
Noninterest expenses on Slide 19 were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter at $429 million. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 3% or $13 million to $432 million. The linked quarter increase in adjusted noninterest expense was primarily due to employee compensation. The increase was associated with higher base salaries and profitability-driven long- and short-term compensation. 
Other noninterest expense includes a $4 million success fee reversal associated with the mark-to-market loss in our SBIC as compared to the $9 million success fee accrual recognized in the second quarter. 
Slide 20 details our loss for credit losses, or ACL., In the upper left, we show the recent declining trend in the ACL to $529 million at the end of the third quarter or 1.11% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right side of this page shows the 3 broad categories that resulted in a decline of $45 million. More than 60% of the change was attributable to changes in the portfolio mix and composition. 
Our updated outlook is found on Slide 21. And as a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the actual results reported for the third quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to forward-looking statements found on Slide 2. 
Due to the degree of uncertainty on the timing of customer submitting requests and the SBA approving those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans. We are more optimistic about loan growth now than we were in July, and as such, we are increasing our outlook to moderately increasing from slightly to moderately increasing, led by core C&I, including our promotional owner-occupied loan product. We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase over the next year as compression of loan and security yields will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into term securities and our more favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans. 
The current quarter's customer-related fees are the highest we have reported. Building on such a strong third quarter, we are reducing our outlook for customer-related fees 1 year from now to be stable to slightly increasing from moderately increasing. We are adjusting our expectation for adjusted noninterest expense to be moderately increasing from slightly increasing. We remain disciplined on expense control. However, increased business activity, emerging inflationary trends and continued investment in enabling technologies will place upward pressure on noninterest expense over the near term. 
And finally, with respect to capital management, we remain comfortable that our philosophy of lower-than-average risk, combined with stronger than median capital, is the right formula for creating long-term shareholder value. Our capital measured by common equity Tier 1 relative to risk-weighted assets remains well above the peer median. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we believe that we have capacity for continued active capital management in the near to medium term, so long as the current macro economic and credit trends continue to be favorable. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Twanda, please open the line for questions."

So first, let me talk about deposits because that's really the driver here, right? We have had deposits across the industry are up. I think we have been able to garner more than our fair share of deposits. And as we are analyzing these deposits over time, what we're finding is a year ago, I would have thought that these deposits were more transitory to borrow or from the Fed than they're proving to be. 
What we're actually observing is that many of these new deposit accounts are being used in an operating nature, which history tells us means that they're more sticky than they otherwise would be. So this is what's giving us confidence to be, I don't want to say aggressive, but certainly buying more securities than we might otherwise would, i.e. putting those deposit dollars to work. 
So as we're thinking about our net interest income outlook next year, and again, remember, this excludes PPP loans, right? So taking them out of the base and not considering them going forward. But we have increased confidence that loan growth will pick up and so we're going to use part of the cash that way. And as that cash continues to prove to be somewhat stable, that is if the deposits continue to prove to be somewhat stable, we will continue to deploy that in investment securities. 
We -- our asset-sensitive position is such that we can afford to continue to add duration on the asset side for some time to come, without really adversely impacting our risk profile. In fact, I would argue it kind of improves our risk profile as we reduce volatility. So it's those key factors. It's the continued deployment of securities and growth in loans that we believe will ultimately drive growth in net interest income over the course of the next year, excluding PPP."

So Dave, so it depends on what we're assuming for deposits, right? Everything is centered around those. As we gain confidence in those deposits, that amount of sort of cash we need to hold for what I would characterize as a liquidity risk, can go down. And what we're seeing is that, as I said, the stability of that cash appears to be improving. 
If you look back over time, you can see that it would not be uncommon at all for us to run with a sort of cash position, i.e., the money market investments line on our balance sheet of kind of $2 billion to $3 billion. And in fact, a year ago, that's where it was. So I wouldn't -- as we gain confidence in the stability of those deposits, I would expect -- and I should also add that there is an enormous amount of liquidity in our investment portfolio. So we're investing relatively short. What that means is that we've got about $400 million of cash flow every month that we're continuing to reinvest. So when we think about our cash position, it's not only cash on the balance sheet, but the cash flow that's turning through the investment portfolio. 
So a long way of saying that, if you look historically, we have run with a cash position that's much, much lower than today. And over time, I would expect to get back to something closer to that."

That promotional rate was 90 basis points and it converts out to 10 years from there, another 9 years at [ $2.99 ]. 
We will probably -- depending on what happens with the rate environment, have each of our affiliates on a cycling basis, keep that HELOC promotion live. And likewise, if we get to the end of the year and the rate environment seems still very flat to stable, we may continue the owner-occupied program for a bit longer as well. Both have been -- we've been really pleased with the energy that both have generated and more than the loans that they produce, it's given all of our bankers, something really exciting to talk about during a pretty challenging time.

If you go back to 2008, 2009, the monetary easing then, that liquidity fundamentally saved in the system and utilization rates, we're not overly burdened by that. So customers just got used to dealing with a higher level of liquidity. Secondly, I would say that our municipal finance business is continuing to grow nicely. We're seeing increases in other C&I pipelines related to larger transactions, syndications, et cetera. 
And CRE in general, I wouldn't look for CRE to grow faster than our portfolio grows, but CRE in general, has been growing nicely. And finally, One of the places where we've seen the most decreases in our portfolio has been in 1 to 4 family mortgages. And based on the mix of that portfolio and the mix of that pipeline, excuse me, we should start to see 1 to 4 family growing again. If you look back over the last 5 or 6 years before the pandemic, 1-to-4-family mortgage products were generally about 20% to 25% of our growth.

The -- and the market pricing has gone up on reserve-based loans, and credit quality structures have improved, they were not bad before, but they've become more conservative. 
As the number of banks globally and particularly in the U.S., has shrunk by probably half, that we'll do energy financing today from kind of 25% to 30% down to sort of the mid-teens. We'll continue to see some midstream growth. Basically, the portfolio is about 40% upstream reserve-based loans, which is what we specialize in, about a similar position of about 40% for midstream and a smaller percentage around 15 for oilfield service.

I'm comfortable with where our limits are, but I don't want to conflate how we use this liquidity to justify taking on a lot more risk. I think the we may find ourselves looking at other opportunities in terms of how we use promotional pricing. I think a big consideration is just systemically how we can support products, where we introduced pricing. And some are simply easier because of the nature of a fixed rate or a term deal where you know that it's going to be outstanding for a period of time. You can have a teaser rate for the first portion. But no, you're pretty confident that you're going to get a sizable annuity in the out years. 
That's not always true with some other loan types, which can be shorter term in nature and a little more challenging to manage in terms of making sure that ultimately this is going to provide some really solid benefit for us.

As we heard from that, I think we'll have certainly an opportunity to do things that would be appealing to customers, and that will provide some capabilities that might be incrementally enticing to sellers. But at the end of the day, we just want to get through that project, clear our minds and then look at the economics of what's out there. And if they make sense, if they -- particularly in market consolidation that improves incrementally economics, that's something we'd certainly look at.

So there is a natural, I would say, limit in terms of how much positioning, we want to be in any given quarter because that quarter that vintage of purchases is defined by the rate environment in that quarter. And so we're trying to be measured as we were then. We're trying to be measured in the deployment of the liquidity. Perhaps we could accelerate it a little bit.

Beginning on Slide 3, the themes that are particularly applicable to Zions, both recently as well as we believe in the near-term horizon, are listed here. We are seeing continued strong deposit growth, continued in the third quarter. This positions Zions well relative to many of our peers to be able to invest in securities and to offer promotions on loan products and core customer segments.  
Secondly, for more than a decade, we worked to position the company to perform very well during an economic downturn. We are really pleased with the results, which you see in our credit outcomes again this quarter.  
Third, we, along with most in the industry, have experienced net attrition of loan balances, excluding PPP loans. But over the last quarter, we started to see some new commercial loan growth, and our strong deposit growth enabled us again to launch some promotional campaigns in June that have resulted in favorable initial results.  
These customers are coming from other banks, and we've also seen new demand from existing customers. All of it is accretive to net interest income relative to leading liquidity and money market accounts and all of it is helpful to our goal of generating positive operating leverage. We're well positioned for rising interest rates, which is helped by strong deposit growth, but also reflects the careful deployment of liquidity during earlier more uncertain points in time.  
As the outlook becomes more certain, we have begun to deploy the liquidity into higher-yielding assets. The final item on this slide refers to our ongoing significant investment in technology, which is designed to enable Zions to remain very competitive in the future, both relative to the largest U.S. banks, with fintechs and with well-established community banks.  
Turning to Slide 4. We are pleased with the results on most fronts. Our campaigns on owner-occupied commercial loans as well as consumer home equity lines of credit resulted in strong growth in both categories, each increasing at an annualized rate exceeding 10% relative to the prior quarter. Excluding PPP loans, our period-end loans in total increased an annualized 5.6%. Deposit growth remained very strong, up an annualized 9.3%, moderately outpacing the growth in the industry, which includes all domestic commercial banks. Over the prior year, deposit growth was 16%, which compares to the industry's rate of 12%.  
It is particularly notable that credit quality continued to improve, again, reporting net loan recoveries and a nearly 30% decline in special mention loans from the prior quarter. These, along with other factors, led to a further release of loan loss reserves.  
We indicated last quarter that we would continue to increase the size of the securities portfolio at a rate greater than what we did in 2020. And in the third quarter, we increased the size of the securities portfolio by nearly $2.3 billion or 12%, and that's not annualized, that's relative to the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.45 per share from $2.08 in the prior quarter. There were 2 primary factors that accounted for the decline: the change in the provision expense and the change in the gains, losses on securities. Combined, those 2 contributed about $0.76 per share less in the third quarter as compared to the second.  
One way we, and perhaps some of you, look at our earnings is to look at adjusted pre-provision net revenue, which excludes securities gains and losses, and subtracting from that actual net charge-offs. On that basis, it was unchanged relative to the prior quarter of $290 million.  
Turning to Slide 5. At the top left is the chart of our recent earnings per share results. The chart on the bottom left shows the per share amount for the provision for credit losses during that same period. The provision effect on earnings per share was quite variable throughout the pandemic and is a major factor in the linked quarter decline in earnings per share. On the right side are some notable items that may be of interest. As previously noted, unrealized losses from securities left a partial offset from a reduced success fee accrual to the SBIC fund manager, equaled $0.12 per share as compared to unrealized gains of $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. Most of the recent gains and losses on securities are attributable to an investment in small business investment company fund.  
One of the companies within the fund successfully completed an IPO in April, which we described in our first quarter 10-Q, with a strong unrealized gain in the second quarter followed by a partial retracement in the third quarter.  
On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The healthy results were attributable to items that I previously described. As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 7. Relative to the prior quarter, we saw further improvement in problem loans using the broadest definition of problem loans, criticized and classified loans dropped more than 17%. Although not shown relative to the prior quarter, special mention loans declined at 29% and classified loans declined 10%.  
Many of you have seen our slide in the past showing our average net charge-off ratio relative to average nonperforming assets plus -- 90-plus days past due loans, which is an indicator of loss severity. And chart of this metric relative to our peers can be seen in the appendix. During the 5 years ending 2020, our average annual loss severity was 15%, while the peer median was 32%. Over the last 12 months, that ratio for Zions is just 6%. We experienced net credit recoveries on loans, which was also true in the prior quarter.  
Perhaps one of the more interesting credit measures to highlight this quarter is that gross charge-offs were very low, $8 million or just 7 basis points and annualized of average non-PPP loans. Shown on the chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the relative stability of net charge-offs. This is mostly the result of changing economic forecasts.  
Our capital position is depicted on Slide 8. We increased our share buyback to $325 million in the third quarter and have indicated that ultimately, we expect to target a common equity Tier 1 ratio at a level moderately above the peer median. We expect to announce any capital actions for the fourth quarter in conjunction with our regularly scheduled Board meeting this coming Friday.  
Next, Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, is going to provide an update on the PPP program and our technology initiatives. Scott?"

Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million, net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. The PPNR bars are split into 2 portions. The bottom portion represents what we think of as generally recurring income, while the top portion denotes the PPNR we've received from PPP loans. 
During the course of the Paycheck Protection Program, our performance were producing, on a relative basis, 3x more than the industry average, will result in approximately $460 million in additional income to the company, which represents capital that ultimately benefits all shareholders. To be specific, PPP-related revenue has equaled $380 million and there remains $83 million in capitalized income, net of origination costs that will be recognized over time. Although PPP-related revenue will decline, we're enthusiastic about the longer-term benefit of adding approximately 20,000 small business customers and strengthening relationships with 57,000 existing customers.  
Turning to Slide 10, reflects some of the highlights from our 3x performance that I noted earlier. Regarding forgiveness, we've received $7.9 billion of applications or nearly 80% of the total volume; $6.7 billion has been approved for forgiveness by the SBA; and $3.1 billion of PPP loans remain on our balance sheet at quarter end.  
Turning to Slide 11, this slide illustrates the longer-term benefit of this activity, specifically as a result of our outreach. You see growing relationships with many of the 77,000 PPP participating customers. These customers collectively have contributed approximately $6 billion of our deposit growth and new non-PPP loan balances exceed $550 million to this collection of customers. More specifically, the PPP 2020 vintage, the spring 2020 vintage, 14,000 new-to-bank customers, approximately 54% are now appear to be utilizing us as their primary -- for their operating accounts. This percentage, as we've noted previously, has been growing nicely each quarter, and we are seeing similar growth trends with the PPP 2021 vintage of 5,000 new-to-bank customers, which started earlier this year.  
Turning to Slide 12, recall that in our investor presentations, we provide a detailed slide of our major technology projects. Today, we want to just highlight two. Many of you may recall, in April, FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams, was quoted as saying that her #1 concern for the banking industry was its reliance on aging core loan and deposit systems.  
So where do we stand on this topic? As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement of our 3 legacy core loan systems and now have virtually all of our loans on our new modern core. In 2023, we expect to complete the final phase of our core modernization journey with the conversion from our legacy deposit systems to our new enterprise core system.  
To put this in perspective, a big 4 accounting firm recently reported that of the top 100 banks in the United States, 93 remain on one or more older first-generation cores, 6 are utilizing a modern core on only a portion of their loan and deposit ecosystem, and Zions is the only bank approaching the ability to utilize a modern core for the entire enterprise. Interestingly, you were starting to hear about some digital-first core systems. While these provide the most advanced architectural elements available and we're generally designed for digital-only banks, none have yet to be proven usable on a scale or complexity required by the largest banks.  
So why does this matter? At a high level, implementation of one core solution across all lines of business, all products and all geographies greatly reduces complexity, enhances our resiliency and creates adaptability for a rapidly changing technology environment that lies ahead. More specifically, the architecture is, as noted on this slide, parameter-driven, meaning we can quickly turn off and on or adjust features without reprogramming or testing for months. It utilizes one data model, a huge advantage in the digital world, and it is natively real-time and API-enabled. This collection of characteristics and others will greatly reduce the time it takes to introduce new products and capabilities.  
As an example, our new core was an important contributor to producing PPP revenue exceeding $460 million. Within a matter of days, we were able to introduce the PPP product and increase the number of business-related loans on our system from approximately 40,000 to over 95,000, with loan boarding occurring in minutes. Most would agree this represents a significant early return on our core replacement investment. As you talk to other banks, they will say that their older first-generation core loan and deposit systems have been adapted to mimic real-time, utilize APIs and synthesize dozens of data models. Well, we were doing that as well in our loan systems and continue to do that in our deposit system until we convert.  
But all of these technologies, all of these technology gymnastics that take place generally in what is referred to as middleware, absolutely introduce complexity, risk and cost. Regarding one additional highlight, I'd like to note that our core system's 7-day processing capability. Most of the world outside the United States operates on 7-day processing. When we implemented the loan portion of our new core, we adopted 7-day processing. However, as the U.S. deposit market has still not adopted 7-day processing, we chose to convert back to 5-day processing in advance of our 2023 deposit conversion. The point is that we were literally able to turn this global capability off over a weekend in August and can turn it back on when the U.S. adopts 7-day processing. This slide also conveys numerous other customer and employee-facing benefits, which I'd be happy to expand on in Q&A.  
Turning to Slide 13, my last slide. While we have been highly focused on our industry-leading work regarding core modernization, I wanted to highlight one of our numerous new customer-facing capabilities. Earlier in the year, we converted 610,000 consumers to our new online mobile platform. While time does not allow us to review all the details of this new platform, we are gratified with the early acceptance by consumers as measured by ratings in the Apple app and Google app stores. You can see that we are on par with the largest U.S. banks and are top tier with our peers. The rollout of this new online mobile system to approximately 150,000 small business clients will occur in 2022. And with this client base, we are already perceived to be on par with or superior to our global competitors.  
With that, I'll turn the remainder of the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer."

More than 3/4 of our revenue is in the form of net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit growth and associated interest rates. As such, I'll begin my",1479,"Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone, and thanks for joining us. More than 3/4 of our revenue is in the form of net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit growth and associated interest rates. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 14 with a review of these results. Although the average total loans were down in the third quarter by 3.7% when compared to the second quarter, we experienced average loan growth when excluding PPP loans. And on a period-end basis, that growth was $661 million or 1.4%. The strongest linked-quarter growth was in commercial construction at nearly $270 million. This is the result of increased construction activity on previously established lines of credit.  
We reported strength in commercial and industrial loans, which increased more than $280 million or 2%. We ran promotions during the quarter on owner-occupied and home equity loans, which increased $215 million and $107 million, respectively. Declines were reported in PPP loans, down $1.4 billion, as Scott previously noted, and term commercial real estate, which declined more than $220 million. 
In the third quarter, we reported a more modest decline in residential mortgage balances than we have in recent quarters, down nearly $130 million. With a strong held for investment pipeline of mortgages, we may see some further stabilization or possibly growth in residential mortgages in the near term.  
One final note on loan growth, relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization has declined several percentage points. Using the third quarter of 2019 as the benchmark quarter, our revolving line utilization rate was 39.5% as compared to 33.7% in the third quarter of 2021, which was essentially from the prior quarter. Although revolving loan balances did increase from the prior quarter, up about $200 million, the lending commitments increased about $700 million.  
As I've noted in the past, deposits have been and remain the driver of balance sheet growth over the past several quarters and in the third quarter. On the right side of this page, average deposits increased 3.7% from the prior quarter. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 16%. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 4.9% over the prior quarter and 24% compared to the prior year period.  
Our noninterest-bearing deposits make up 1/2 of average total deposits. The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the 6.7% yield on the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 8 basis points to 3.59% from 3.67%. Deposit costs remain low. Our cost of total deposits fell to 3 basis points in the third quarter.  
Moving to Slide 15, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by nearly $6 billion over the past year to $21 billion, while money market investments increased more than $7.5 billion to $11.9 billion. The combination of securities and money market investments has risen to nearly 40% of total earning assets at period end, which compares to an average level in 2019 prior to the pandemic of 26%.  
We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively short duration, both in the current and in an upward shock -- rate shock scenario. The $3.6 billion of security purchases for the quarter had an average yield of 1.53%.  
Slide 16 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart in the left shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity as described on the prior page. For the third quarter, this growth in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right as the strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments.  
The weighted average yield of our securities and money market investments is just 1.07%. And with that concentration increasing by 4 percentage points in the quarter, it weighed on the net interest margin. In fact, I estimate that the increase in money market investments has accounted for 33 of the 45 basis point net interest margin compression over the past year.  
Slide 17 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left quadrant as a general statement, our asset sensitivity has increased as deposits have been invested in short-term money market assets. This increase in estimated rate sensitivity assumes that the incremental deposits have modestly shorter duration characteristics when compared to deposits on our balance sheet prior to the recent deposit surge. We are continuing to deploy deposit-driven cash into securities, which helps to moderate the natural asset sensitivity. However, with continued strong deposit growth and higher prepayment rates on mortgage loans and securities, our estimated interest rate sensitivity was similar to the second quarter level, such that in an interest rate environment that is shocked immediately 100 basis points higher than the current level, our net interest income at a 12-month horizon is estimated to be higher by 12%.  
As previously noted, we may continue to add interest rate swaps, including forward-starting swaps, which would help to temper our natural asset sensitivity.  
On Slide 18, building on a good second quarter, customer-related fees increased an additional 9% in the third quarter to $151 million. Notably, activity-based fees such as card fees, merchant services and retail and business banking fees remain strong and have grown to the level of 2 years ago prior to the pandemic. This improvement added to continued strength in loan-related capital markets and wealth management revenues.  
Noninterest expenses on Slide 19 were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter at $429 million. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 3% or $13 million to $432 million. The linked-quarter increase in adjusted noninterest expense was primarily due to employee compensation. The increase was associated with higher base salaries and profitability-driven long- and short-term compensation.  
Other noninterest expense includes a $4 million success fee reversal associated with the mark-to-market loss in our SBIC as compared to the $9 million success fee accrual recognized in the second quarter.  
Slide 20 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. In the upper left, we show the recent declining trend in the ACL to $529 million at the end of the third quarter or 1.11% of non-PPP loans. The chart on the lower right side of this page shows the 3 broad categories that resulted in a decline of $45 million. More than 60% of the change was attributable to changes in the portfolio mix and composition.  
Our updated outlook is found on Slide 21. And as a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the actual results reported for the third quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to forward-looking statements found on Slide 2.  
Due to the degree of uncertainty on the timing of customer submitting requests and the SBA approving those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans. We are more optimistic about loan growth now than we were in July, and as such, we are increasing our outlook to moderately increasing from slightly to moderately increasing, led by core C&I, including our promotional owner-occupied loan product. We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase over the next year as compression of loan and securities yields will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into term securities and our more favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans.  
The current quarter's customer-related fees are the highest we have reported. Building on such a strong third quarter, we are reducing our outlook for customer-related fees 1 year from now to be stable to slightly increasing from moderately increasing. We are adjusting our expectation for adjusted noninterest expense to be moderately increasing from slightly increasing. We remain disciplined on expense control. However, increased business activity, emerging inflationary trends and continued investment in enabling technologies will place upward pressure on noninterest expense over the near term.  
And finally, with respect to capital management, we remain comfortable that our philosophy of lower-than-average risk, combined with stronger than median capital, is the right formula for creating long-term shareholder value. Our capital measured by common equity Tier 1 relative to risk-weighted assets remains well above the peer median. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we believe that we have capacity for continued active capital management in the near to medium term, so long as the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue to be favorable.  
This concludes our prepared remarks. Twanda, please open the line for questions."

So first, let me talk about deposits because that's really the driver here, right? We have had -- deposits across the industry are up. I think we have been able to garner more than our fair share of deposits. And as we are analyzing these deposits over time, what we're finding is a year ago, I would have thought that these deposits were more transitory to borrow or from the Fed than they're proving to be. 
What we're actually observing is that many of these new deposit accounts are being used in an operating nature, which history tells us means that they're more sticky than they otherwise would be. So this is what's giving us confidence to be, I don't want to say aggressive, but certainly buying more securities than we might otherwise would, i.e. putting those deposit dollars to work. 
So as we're thinking about our net interest income outlook next year, and again, remember, this excludes PPP loans, right? So taking them out of the base and not considering them going forward. But we have increased confidence that loan growth will pick up and so we're going to use part of the cash that way. And as that cash continues to prove to be somewhat stable, that is if the deposits continue to prove to be somewhat stable, we will continue to deploy that in investment securities. 
We -- our asset-sensitive position is such that we can afford to continue to add duration on the asset side for some time to come, without really adversely impacting our risk profile. In fact, I would argue it kind of improves our risk profile as we reduce volatility. So it's those key factors. It's the continued deployment of securities and growth in loans that we believe will ultimately drive growth in net interest income over the course of the next year, excluding PPP."

And what we're seeing is that, as I said, the stability of that cash appears to be improving. 
If you look back over time, you can see that it would not be uncommon at all for us to run with a sort of cash position, i.e., the money market investments line on our balance sheet of kind of $2 billion to $3 billion. And in fact, a year ago, that's where it was. So I wouldn't -- as we gain confidence in the stability of those deposits, I would expect -- and I should also add that there is an enormous amount of liquidity in our investment portfolio. So we're investing relatively short. What that means is that we've got about $400 million of cash flow every month that we're continuing to reinvest. So when we think about our cash position, it's not only cash on the balance sheet, but the cash flow that's churning through the investment portfolio. 
So a long way of saying that, if you look historically, we have run with a cash position that's much, much lower than today. And over time, I would expect to get back to something closer to that."

If you go back to the 2008, 2009, the monetary easing then, that liquidity fundamentally saved in the system and utilization rates, we're not overly burdened by that. So customers just got used to dealing with a higher level of liquidity. Secondly, I would say that our municipal finance business is continuing to grow nicely. We're seeing increases in other C&I pipelines related to larger transactions, syndications, et cetera. 
And CRE in general, I wouldn't look for CRE to grow faster than our portfolio grows, but CRE in general, has been growing nicely. And finally, One of the places where we've seen the most decreases in our portfolio has been in 1-4 family mortgages. And based on the mix of that portfolio -- the mix of that pipeline, excuse me, we should start to see 1-4 family growing again. If you look back over the last 5 or 6 years before the pandemic, 1-4 family mortgage products were generally about 20% to 25% of our growth.

At these prices, which were predictable for both oil and natural gas, we will start to see drilling increase. And you will see line utilization going up, and there are far fewer players today. The -- and the market pricing has gone up on reserve-based loans, and credit quality structures have improved, they were not bad before, but they've become more conservative. 
As the number of banks globally and particularly in the U.S., has shrunk by probably half, that we'll do energy financing today from kind of 25% to 30% down to sort of the mid-teens. We'll continue to see some midstream growth. Basically, the portfolio is about 40%, 45% upstream reserve-based loans, which is what we specialize in, about a similar position of about 40% for midstream and a smaller percentage around 15% for oilfield service.

I'm comfortable with where our limits are, but I don't want to conflate how we use this liquidity to justify taking on a lot more risk. I think the we may find ourselves looking at other opportunities in terms of how we use promotional pricing. I think a big consideration is just systemically how we can support products, where we introduced pricing. And some are simply easier because of the nature of a fixed rate or a term deal where you know that it's going to be outstanding for a period of time. You can have a teaser rate for the first portion. But no, you're pretty confident that you're going to get a sizable annuity in the out years. 
That's not always true with some other loan types, which can be shorter term in nature and a little more challenging to manage in terms of making sure that ultimately this is going to provide some really solid benefit for us.

And then second priority would be securities. And again, it's relatively short term. 
So to the extent these deposits stay sticky, the answer is going to be, first, we'll fund the loans and then sort of whatever is left over, leaving a kind of a storehouse of cash for immediate liquidity will over time be invested into longer-term securities. I hope that's helped. It's a little -- I know it's not precise, but that's the thought process.

We're adding $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter. 
So there is a natural, I would say, limit in terms of how much positioning we want to be in any given quarter because that quarter, that vintage of purchases is defined by the rate environment in that quarter. And so we're trying to be measured as we were then. We're trying to be measured in the deployment of the liquidity. Perhaps we could accelerate it a little bit. But just like we said back then, we don't want to take a very large position in the rate environment in any given quarter, which is why we're sort of legging into the position as opposed to putting all of our chips on rent, if you will."
