Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. We are pleased to report that we have concluded the quarter with revenues of $358 million and the year with record revenues of $1.46 billion. Revenues for the fourt",1515,"Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. We are pleased to report that we have concluded the quarter with revenues of $358 million and the year with record revenues of $1.46 billion. Revenues for the fourth quarter in our solar business were approximately $327 million, also above last quarter's solar revenues. 
Our solar revenues this quarter reflect strength in the U.S. residential market, which we had anticipated in our earnings call last quarter. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter growth in shipments from the residential segment in the U.S. was in excess of 50%. We expect this strong growth in our revenues from U.S. residential products to continue in the first quarter of 2021 as well. We have also experienced very healthy growth in our solar revenues from countries outside of the U.S. and Europe with record quarterly revenues in Australia, where we finished 2020 and with over 30% year-over-year growth. 
Our Europe solar revenues was down from Q3, as is the typical seasonal behavior of the European market. However, on an annual basis, we are closing the year with record solar revenue in Europe of $579 million, up from $522 million last year, led by the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Poland. We are very happy with these results, in particular, in a challenged COVID year. 
This quarter, we shipped over 1.36 gigawatts of AC nameplate inverters, approximately 457 megawatts of which were shipped in North America. Shipments to Europe consisted of 594 megawatts. From a segmental point of view, we shipped this quarter 566 megawatts of commercial products and 798 megawatts of residential products. This split represents the strength in residential I discussed earlier and a noticeable reduction in commercial shipments, in line with what we explained in our call last quarter regarding the slower recovery of commercial installations and the higher inventory of commercial products in the channel. 
In the fourth quarter, we believe commercial installations worldwide were still impacted by the economic slowdown. However, we did see an increase in the installation rate of our commercial products and a reduction in inventory levels this quarter, which we believe indicates that the recovery in the commercial segment is underway. Overall, this quarter, we shipped 3.6 million power optimizers and approximately 166,000 inverters. 
As discussed in our last call, the ramp of production in our Sella 1 manufacturing facility in Israel continues. This, together with our manufacturing in Vietnam and Hungary, will enable us to supply approximately 85% of our U.S. products without tariffs by the end of the first quarter of 2021. 
On the product side, I want to spend a bit more time on our residential offering, and in particular, our complete storage system. We continue to see good market acceptance and strong demand for our Energy Hub single-phase storage inverter. In the fourth quarter, we shipped to the U.S. close to 15,000 Energy Hub inverters, up from approximately 6,500 in Q3. So far, we released the Energy Hub in power levels between 3.8 to 7.6 kilowatts. In the coming months, we will release the high-power version with inverter offerings of 10 and 11.4 kilowatts. The high-power versions are especially important as average installation sizes increase, with consumers being more aware and interested in more power and more stored energy for backup and outage scenarios. 
Our Energy Hub supports today easy charger integration, multiple batteries for increased capacity and multi-inverter configurations to our backup interface for increased power. In the coming months, we will add generator integration and high backup power models, allowing 7 kilowatts and 10 kilowatts of continuous power, critical for backup as a typical house load during power outages. The product is designed to handle consumption patterns that we have learned from our installed base of tens of thousands of battery-connected inverters. 
We see the Energy Hub as a differentiated storage system, optimized for energy harvest and energy management in grid-connected and backup scenarios. To complete the system, the Energy Hub is connected to a battery in a DC-coupled configuration, aimed to enable harvesting of all the energy from the modules on the roof. To clarify, typically, a system is oversight such that the total power of the modules on the roof or of the individual module is larger than the capacity of the inverter. As such, in an AC-coupled configuration, the utilization of the energy generated from the roof will be limited by the size of the inverter. 
In our SolarEdge DC-coupled configuration, all the energy generated by the modules will be harvested and either used to power the required house consumption or to charge the battery in parallel, thus extending backup time and increasing system utilization. 
The Energy Hub inverter can be coupled with a third-party battery, as we currently offer, or our own battery. In that regard, we are on track with the schedule discussed last quarter of initial shipments of our own battery in Q2 and meaningful volumes in Q3. 
In the commercial segment, we are beginning these days shipments of the new and large synergy inverter with power rating of up to 120 kilowatts. In parallel, we began shipments of higher-power commercial optimizers of up to 1,100 watts for a 2-module configuration, this in order to match the trend of high-power modules that are becoming available around the world. The higher-power modules and optimizers, combined with a higher-power inverter, will reduce the cost per watt for our commercial installers and we expect will increase adoption similar to what we have seen in 2020, where our annual commercial megawatt shipments were up more than 25% compared to 2019. 
In addition, we are seeing growing adoption of our designer software workflow solution, which enables installers to easily design complex rooftops and seamlessly export the design for quick installation and monitoring setup after installation. On average, every month, approximately 70,000 designs are created on the platform by more than 12,000 installer accounts. 
Moving to our nonsolar business. As announced earlier today, SolarEdge e-Mobility has been selected as the Tier 1 supplier for full powertrains and batteries for the Fiat e-Ducato. For those of you who are not familiar with this vehicle, the Fiat Ducato is recognized by many as the leading light commercial vehicle in Europe and has been produced since 1981. Recently, FCA presented the electric version of the Ducato, and we are proud that SolarEdge e-Mobility has been selected to supply the full powertrain and batteries for this vehicle in Europe. Our solution includes inverters, DC-to-DC converters, batteries, onboard chargers, vehicle control units and software for electrical vehicles. 
As I have mentioned in past calls, we have already delivered prototypes for close to 100 e-Ducato vehicles that are accumulating mileage throughout Europe today. We believe the experience gained through this project, which has including adapting some of our production lines through automotive quality standards, will serve us in our solar and other businesses well beyond the already exciting news of being part of the e-mobility industry. 
The automotive industry planned its vehicles years before they hit the road. This nomination reflects a long-term investment and is in line with our growth plans beyond solar that we have laid out in our earnings calls and that formed the basis for our acquisition. Subject to market acceptance, in 2021, we expect our e-Mobility business to deliver between $100 million to $120 million of revenue. 
In our energy storage division, Kokam's revenue grew by 25% this year. And for the first time in many years, Kokam is profitable. As a reminder, we completed the Kokam acquisition in October 2018. And this year, we have ramped the existing lithium-ion cells and battery pack factory to full capacity. 
This quarter, we also welcomed S.W. Jung to our team as the General Manager of Kokam. Mr. Jung is an industry veteran with more than 2 decades of experience in leadership positions in Samsung Electronics. We are excited to have him on board to lead our energy storage business out of Korea. 
This quarter, we also began construction of our Sella 2 factory in Korea. This factory, which is part of Kokam, represents another pillar of our growth strategy beyond solar, and once completed, will manufacture 2 gigawatt-hour of lithium-ion cells per year. The factory spread over 56,000 square meters just outside of Seoul will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and is expected to start production in the first half of 2022. This capacity will enable us to supply cells through our own battery storage solutions and for other applications. 
We ended 2020 with record revenues of $1.46 billion, slightly above those of last year. Like most, when the pandemic hit, we adjusted both our expenditure and forecast to take into account the impact of the economic slowdown. And given the circumstances, we are pleased to have completed the year with revenue slightly above those of last year. No less important, we were able to deliver these results while continuing to invest and execute on our solar and nonsolar growth strategies. 
And with this, I hand over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

This financial review includes the GAAP and non-GAAP discussion. Full reconciliation of the pro forma to GAAP results discussed on this call is available on our website and in the press release issued today. 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $358.1 million, a 6% increase compared to $338.1 million last quarter and a 14% decrease compared to $418.2 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the sale of solar products were $327.1 million, a 5% increase compared to $312.5 million last quarter. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $132.3 million and represented 40.4% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were $146.7 million or 45% of our revenues. 
This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 64% of our solar revenues and included more European customers than last quarter. 3 customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenue. While pricing levels remained stable this quarter, blended ASP per watt for our solar products increased by approximately 12.5% compared to last quarter, a direct result of higher revenues from residential product offering and an increased portion of revenues derived from the United States. 
In line with what Zvi explained, inventory levels held by our distributors in the United States were healthy on the residential side and still higher than desired on the commercial segment. This is in line with our expectation, and this level will return to normal towards the second quarter of 2021. 
This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar products were $31 million, led by sales of lithium-ion batteries by Kokam and increased sales by e-Mobility. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.8% compared to 32% in the prior quarter and 34.3% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared to 33.5% in the prior quarter and 35.5% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the solar business was 36.2% compared to 34.8% in the last quarter, in line with our solar gross margin target of 36% plus/minus 1%. This increase in the non-GAAP solar margin is the result of larger portion of U.S. revenues; increased portion of residential products out of the total revenues; improved exchange rates on sales in Europe; and cost-reduction activities, including reduction in the portion of Chinese-made products that are subject to custom tariffs in the United States in our overall product mix. 
This quarter, approximately 60% of products shipped into the United States came from our nontariff production. Sella 1 production continued to ramp according to plan and is expected to reach full production capacity at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Until then, the ramp has a negative impact on our gross margin. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for our nonsolar activity was minus 6.4% compared to positive 16.9% in the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly a result of an increase in e-Mobility preproduction expenses related to the e-Ducato project. The powertrain units sold in this project are highly complicated systems that include several components that are produced in part by contract manufacturers and assembled in our Italian manufacturing facilities. Over the last quarter, we have been building manufacturing capacity in Italy that includes an increase in the number of employees and associated expenses that are charged into the cost of goods sold. 
As a result of the relatively small number of units currently being produced, the complexity of manufacturing and the fact that we have built production capacity that can suffice the projected manufacturing level starting in Q1 2021, our margins on these projects are currently negative. Once we stabilize the manufacturing at a higher output level, the margin will be at a single-digit level based on current anticipated volumes. 
Moving to our operating expenses. In total, GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $95.9 million or 26.8% of revenues compared to $77.7 million or 23% of revenue in the prior quarter and to $92.7 million or 22.2% of revenues for the same quarter last year. A major part of the increase this quarter is a result of stock-based compensation. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $72.9 million or 20.4% of revenues compared to $63.2 million or 18.7% of revenues in the prior quarter and $63.1 million or 15.1% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 18.9% compared to 16.7% last quarter. 
Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $14.4 million compared to $30.4 million in the previous quarter and $50.5 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $43.5 million compared to $50 million in the previous quarter and $85.3 million for the same period last year. 
This quarter, non-GAAP solar activities resulted in operating profit of $56.5 million compared to an operating profit of $56.7 million last quarter. This number represents 17.3% of our solar revenues and is slightly lower than our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. The nonsolar activity resulted in a non-GAAP operating loss of $13 million compared to an operating loss of $6.6 million in the previous quarter, mainly from our e-Mobility division. 
Financial income for the quarter was $10.4 million compared to financial income of $15.8 million in the previous quarter and financial income of $11.1 million for the same period last year. This income is a result of foreign currency changes, offset by increased finance expenses related to the accounting treatment of our convertible debt and leases. Tax expense was $7.2 million this quarter compared to a tax expense of $2.4 million in the prior quarter and $9.2 million for the same period last year. 
Our non-GAAP tax expense was $4.6 million compared to $1.6 million in the previous quarter and $10.4 million for the same period last year. Our tax rate is positively affected in the last quarters by higher deductible expenses for tax purposes resulting from exercise of employees' stock compensation. 
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $17.7 million compared to a GAAP net income of $43.8 million in the previous quarter and $52.8 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income was $55.7 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $65.9 million in the previous quarter and $87.4 million for the same quarter last year. 
GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.33 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.83 in the previous quarter and $1.03 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.98 compared to $1.21 in the previous quarter and $1.65 in the same quarter last year. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and investments were $530.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated $27 million in cash from operations. AR net increased nominally this quarter to $218.7 million compared to $183.1 million last quarter. DSO this quarter in the solar business was 75 days, an increase from 70 days last quarter. 
As of December 31, 2020, our inventory level net of reserves was at $331.7 million compared to $297 million in the prior quarter. A substantial portion of this growth is attributed to an increase in raw material inventory in anticipation of start-up production in our e-Mobility division, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our finished goods in the solar business. 
Let's move now to summarize the full year of 2020. Revenues for the year were $1.46 billion, a 2.4% increase from $1.43 billion in the calendar year 2019. Revenues related to our solar business were $1.36 billion, a 1.5% increase compared to 2019. GAAP gross margin was 31.6% compared to 33.6% in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33% compared to 34.9% in the prior year. GAAP net income for 2020 was $140.3 million, a 4.2% decrease compared to $146.6 million in the prior year and GAAP diluted EPS of $2.66 compared to $2.90 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for 2020 was $224.4 million, a 3.5% decrease compared to $233.2 million in 2019 and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.11 compared to $4.44 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for our solar business was $264 million, a 4% increase compared to $254.1 million in 2019. This year, we generated $222.7 million in cash from operations. 
Moving now to guidance for the first quarter of 2021. We expect revenues in the first quarter to be within the range of $385 million to $405 million. Revenues from the sale of solar products are expected to be within the range of $360 million and $375 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 34% to 36%. Non-GAAP gross margin from solar activities is expected to be within the range of 36% to 38%.

You need to understand that there is a big difference, as you can see, and it's growing between the GAAP and non-GAAP. A lot of it is related to the stock-based compensation given the fact that stock price hiked so much. And therefore, these expenses are representing a bigger portion. 
But in general, I would start by saying that the way that we would like to see gross margins in a way that allows us to be between 20% to 23% of operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. So that means that we are aiming at around 15%, 16% of non-GAAP operating expenses coming for the solar business. 
Now I think that we need to differentiate here between the solar and the nonsolar business. In the solar business, the revenues are relatively high. And as long as we are able to maintain growth rates, the numbers of the revenues and the impact is going to be so large that you should see an operational level where when the numbers are growing, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues will go down. 
We continue to invest in R&D as much as we can. Today, it's hard to broaden much more or as quick as we would like, the R&D, simply given the fact that we already have a base of new people. So therefore, to get many people in a short time is an issue. 
On sales and marketing and G&A, there are economies of scale. And therefore, we should expect to see this operating leverage continuing. The issue -- and the big question is usually around the newer businesses because these are businesses that are in a, I would call it, investment mode. And naturally, we would like to invest there in R&D or market development. 
So for example, in the e-mobility space, we definitely want to increase the product selection, and we want to go to newer generation. In general there, I would assume that you may see a situation where the growth in operating expenses is similar to the growth that you will see in the revenues. But when you tie everything together with the solar that is so much bigger than the others, again, you should see that in the overall picture, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses should decline over time."

And this is basically a result of several things. The first one is the fact that we start to see the United States being back a more meaningful portion of our revenues of the solar revenues. As we mentioned before, actually at the end of Q2, what we saw is that when the pandemic started and the U.S. market was hit, we were able to grow substantially in Europe that in a way -- that, on one hand, did not impact the revenues maybe as much as it would hit unless we were so active in Europe, but at the same time, the higher competition and intensity in Europe prescribed much lower gross margins. And at that time, by the way, we have -- I noted there's about a 500 basis point difference between the U.S. and Europe in this regard. 
Over time, 2 things happened. The first thing is that the euro got a little bit stronger compared to the U.S. dollar. This is something that, of course, helps our margins in the sense that we still manufacture in dollars, and therefore, we collect more dollars on every euro sale that we're doing. And the second one is that once we're starting to sell in the United States, where the competition is a little bit lower on residential due to the rapid shutdown regulations, then we were able to charge higher revenues than to increase the margin. 
And there is another issue that happened in the fourth quarter, and this is the fact that, in general, commercial solar that is characterized with lower gross margins compared to residential was again lower compared to the previous quarters. So this is the main change that happened. 
Looking forward, as already described in our guidance, we expected the non-GAAP gross margin to be at 36% to 38%. So the midpoint is already at the higher range of our long-term target. And we expect this to continue to happen. We continue to do cost reduction all the time. The pricing environment is relatively stable both in the United States and in Europe. And we are continuing all the time to shift more and more production to a non-Chinese manufacturing, at least the production that comes to the United States. And compared to 60% of shipments of non-Chinese products in Q4, about 85% of these products that will come to the U.S. in Q1 will be already from nontariffs. So this is something that definitely drive us to the higher range and the higher levels that we guided. 
There is one phenomena, though, that we need to mention, and this is actually for the later part of the year. While we assume that we will see the normalization in the solar margins in Q1 and Q2, actually, in Q3, once batteries are starting to get bigger volumes and starting to have more effect on our margins. And here, in the past, we discussed approximately 25% expected margins on batteries. We expect that the overall portion of batteries in the revenues mix will drive this margin a little bit down. 
So in general, we are normalizing in solar without batteries. Once batteries will come, we will basically provide guidance a little bit about how to model and how to expect gross margins to be related to the volume of batteries of the overall revenues."

They're negative today, but what's the target for margins to go positive in e-Mobility, time frame-wise? And ultimately, are you at the 25% or 30%, I think, target you've talked about in the past?

In general, we expect -- volumes will initiate this quarter, and we believe that they will stabilize around Q2 or beginning of Q2 towards the end of the year. So I would assume that the majority of the revenues will come between Q2 to Q4. And that means that at that point, in Q2, we already expect to see positive gross margin on this product. 
However, I think that we need to differentiate between the longer-term margins that we expect on e-Mobility and the margins on this project. And the 2 key differentiators is, first of all, the fact that in e-Mobility, unlike in solar, it's very hard to do cost reduction once the product is defined, nevertheless, if it was launched or not. Because in the e-mobility space, once you have defined the product and you basically validated the product with the manufacturer, you cannot change any component. And that, of course, reduces dramatically your ability to either make changes in the product for cost reduction or even to negotiate with your suppliers because they know that they're already designed into the product. 
In the case of this e-Ducato project, it's a product -- project that we inherited from the acquisition of SMRE. And therefore, there is not a lot that we can do in this specific product to reduce cost. And we expect to see single-digit margins starting in Q2, and they will not be very high. 
Once -- we will see 2 things happening. First of all, if indeed the market acceptance is going to be good for this product, then we will see higher volumes, and then we will be able to spread the fixed costs that we already have here over a larger amount of units. And this, of course, will increase the gross margin. And second, we will be able, maybe over time when we'll have more projects, to go and reduce cost of product if we're using them -- or components if you use them in other products as well because then we have more leverage with the suppliers. But in any case, I do not expect it to happen -- not in 2021 and not in the volumes that we're discussing right now. 
Lastly, 30% is -- I do not believe that this is a number that can be achieved in the near future in e-Mobility. If you look today at comparable companies in the e-mobility space, you see best margins being at about 18%, and these are very technological and very good companies. It will take us the time to get to that level of expertise. But at the same time, you usually see that the cost per unit is high enough that the overall contribution to profitability, even if the margin is lower, is very high because every unit is very expensive. So I hope that it answered all of the components. If not, let me know what I missed."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. We are pleased to report that we have concluded the quarter with revenues of $358 million and the year with record revenues of $1.46 billion. Revenues for the fourth quarter in our solar business were approximately $327 million, also above last quarter's solar revenues. 
Our solar revenues this quarter reflect strength in the U.S. residential market, which we had anticipated in our earnings call last quarter. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter growth in shipments from the residential segment in the U.S. was in excess of 50%. We expect this strong growth in our revenues from U.S. residential products to continue in the first quarter of 2021 as well. We have also experienced very healthy growth in our solar revenues from countries outside of the U.S. and Europe with record quarterly revenues in Australia, where we finished 2020 and with over 30% year-over-year growth. 
Our Europe solar revenues was down from Q3, as is the typical seasonal behavior of the European market. However, on an annual basis, we are closing the year with record solar revenue in Europe of $579 million, up from $522 million last year, led by the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Poland. We are very happy with these results, in particular, in a challenged COVID year. 
This quarter, we shipped over 1.36 gigawatts of AC nameplate inverters, approximately 457 megawatts of which were shipped in North America. Shipments to Europe consisted of 594 megawatts. From a segmental point of view, we shipped this quarter 566 megawatts of commercial products and 798 megawatts of residential products. This split represents the strength in residential I discussed earlier and a noticeable reduction in commercial shipments, in line with what we explained in our call last quarter regarding the slower recovery of commercial installations and the higher inventory of commercial products in the channel. 
In the fourth quarter, we believe commercial installations worldwide were still impacted by the economic slowdown. However, we did see an increase in the installation rate of our commercial products and a reduction in inventory levels this quarter, which we believe indicates that the recovery in the commercial segment is underway. Overall, this quarter, we shipped 3.6 million power optimizers and approximately 166,000 inverters. 
As discussed in our last call, the ramp of production in our Sella 1 manufacturing facility in Israel continues. This, together with our manufacturing in Vietnam and Hungary, will enable us to supply approximately 85% of our U.S. products without tariffs by the end of the first quarter of 2021. 
On the product side, I want to spend a bit more time on our residential offering, and in particular, our complete storage system. We continue to see good market acceptance and strong demand for our EnergyHub single-phase storage inverter. In the fourth quarter, we shipped to the U.S. close to 15,000 EnergyHub inverters, up from approximately 6,500 in Q3. So far, we released the EnergyHub in power levels between 3.8 to 7.6 kilowatts. In the coming months, we will release the high-power version with inverter offerings of 10 and 11.4 kilowatts. The high-power versions are especially important as average installation sizes increase, with consumers being more aware and interested in more power and more stored energy for backup and outage scenarios. 
Our EnergyHub supports today easy charger integration, multiple batteries for increased capacity and multi-inverter configurations to our backup interface for increased power. In the coming months, we will add generator integration and high backup power models, allowing 7 kilowatts and 10 kilowatts of continuous power, critical for backup of a typical house load during power outages. The product is designed to handle consumption patterns that we have learned from our installed base of tens of thousands of battery-connected inverters. 
We see the EnergyHub as a differentiated storage system, optimized for energy harvest and energy management in grid-connected and backup scenarios. To complete the system, the EnergyHub is connected to a battery in a DC-coupled configuration, aimed to enable harvesting of all the energy from the modules on the roof. To clarify, typically, a system is oversized such that the total power of the modules on the roof or of the individual module is larger than the capacity of the inverter. As such, in an AC-coupled configuration, the utilization of the energy generated from the roof will be limited by the size of the inverter. 
In our SolarEdge DC-coupled configuration, all the energy generated by the modules will be harvested and either used to power the required house consumption or to charge the battery in parallel, thus extending backup time and increasing system utilization. 
The EnergyHub inverter can be coupled with a third-party battery, as we currently offer, or our own battery. In that regard, we are on track with the schedule discussed last quarter of initial shipments of our own battery in Q2 and meaningful volumes in Q3. 
In the commercial segment, we are beginning the base shipments of the new enlarged synergy inverter with power rating of up to 120 kilowatts. In parallel, we began shipments of higher-power commercial optimizers of up to 1,100 watts for a 2-module configuration, this in order to match the trend of high-power modules that are becoming available around the world. The higher-power modules and optimizers, combined with a higher-power inverter, will reduce the cost per watt for our commercial installers and we expect will increase adoption similar to what we have seen in 2020, where our annual commercial megawatt shipments were up more than 25% compared to 2019. 
In addition, we are seeing growing adoption of our designer software workflow solution, which enables installers to easily design complex rooftops and seamlessly export the design for quick installation and monitoring setup after installation. On average, every month, approximately 70,000 designs are created on the platform by more than 12,000 installer accounts. 
Moving to our nonsolar business. As announced earlier today, SolarEdge e-Mobility has been selected as the Tier 1 supplier for full powertrains and batteries for the Fiat e-Ducato. For those of you who are not familiar with this vehicle, the Fiat Ducato is recognized by many as the leading light commercial vehicle in Europe and has been produced since 1981. Recently, FCA presented the electric version of the Ducato, and we are proud that SolarEdge e-Mobility has been selected to supply the full powertrain and batteries for this vehicle in Europe. Our solution includes inverters, DC-to-DC converters, batteries, onboard chargers, vehicle control units and software for electrical vehicles. 
As I have mentioned in past calls, we have already delivered prototypes for close to 100 e-Ducato vehicles that are accumulating mileage throughout Europe today. We believe the experience gained through this project, which has including adapting some of our production lines through automotive quality standards, will serve us in our solar and other businesses well beyond the already exciting news of being part of the e-mobility industry. 
The automotive industry planned its vehicles years before they hit the road. This nomination reflects a long-term investment and is in line with our growth plans beyond solar that we have laid out in our earning calls and that formed the basis for our acquisition. Subject to market acceptance, in 2021, we expect our e-Mobility business to deliver between $100 million to $120 million of revenue. 
In our energy storage division, Kokam's revenue grew by 25% this year. And for the first time in many years, Kokam is profitable. As a reminder, we completed the Kokam acquisition in October 2018. And this year, we have ramped the existing lithium-ion cells and battery pack factory to full capacity. 
This quarter, we also welcomed SW Jeong to our team as the General Manager of Kokam. Mr. Jeong is an industry veteran with more than 2 decades of experience in leadership positions in Samsung Electronics. We are excited to have him on board to lead our energy storage business out of Korea. 
This quarter, we also began construction of our Sella 2 factory in Korea. This factory, which is part of Kokam, represents another pillar of our growth strategy beyond solar, and once completed, will manufacture 2 gigawatt-hour of lithium-ion cells per year. The factory's spread over 56,000 square meters just outside of Seoul will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and is expected to start production in the first half of 2022. This capacity will enable us to supply cells through our own battery storage solutions and for other applications. 
We ended 2020 with record revenues of $1.46 billion, slightly above those of last year. Like most, when the pandemic hit, we adjusted both our expenditure and forecast to take into account the impact of the economic slowdown. And given the circumstances, we are pleased to have completed the year with revenue slightly above those of last year. No less important, we were able to deliver these results while continuing to invest and execute on our solar and nonsolar growth strategies. 
And with this, I hand over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $358.1 million, a 6% increase compared to $338.1 million last quarter and a 14% decrease compared to $418.2 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the sale of solar products were $327.1 million, a 5% increase compared to $312.5 million last quarter. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $132.3 million and represented 40.4% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were $146.7 million or 45% of our revenues. 
This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 64% of our solar revenues and included more European customers than last quarter. 3 customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenue. While pricing levels remained stable this quarter, blended ASP per watt for our solar products increased by approximately 12.5% compared to last quarter, a direct result of higher revenues from residential product offering and an increased portion of revenues derived from the United States. 
In line with what Zvi explained, inventory levels held by our distributors in the United States were healthy on the residential side and still higher than desired on the commercial segment. This is in line with our expectation, and this level will return to normal towards the second quarter of 2021. 
This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar products were $31 million, led by sales of lithium-ion batteries by Kokam and increased sales by e-Mobility. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.8% compared to 32% in the prior quarter and 34.3% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared to 33.5% in the prior quarter and 35.5% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the solar business was 36.2% compared to 34.8% in the last quarter, in line with our solar gross margin target of 36% plus/minus 1%. This increase in the non-GAAP solar margin is the result of larger portion of U.S. revenues; increased portion of residential products out of the total revenues; improved exchange rates on sales in Europe; and cost-reduction activities, including reduction in the portion of Chinese-made products that are subject to custom tariffs in the United States in our overall product mix. 
This quarter, approximately 60% of products shipped into the United States came from our nontariff production. Sella 1 production continued to ramp according to plan and is expected to reach full production capacity at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Until then, the ramp has a negative impact on our gross margin. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for our nonsolar activity was minus 6.4% compared to positive 16.9% in the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly a result of an increase in e-Mobility preproduction expenses related to the e-Ducato project. The powertrain units sold in this project are highly complicated systems that include several components that are produced in part by contract manufacturers and assembled in our Italian manufacturing facilities. Over the last quarter, we have been building manufacturing capacity in Italy that includes an increase in the number of employees and associated expenses that are charged into the cost of goods sold. 
As a result of the relatively small number of units currently being produced, the complexity of manufacturing and the fact that we have built production capacity that can suffice the projected manufacturing level starting in Q1 2021, our margins on these projects are currently negative. Once we stabilize the manufacturing at a higher output level, the margin will be at a single-digit level based on current anticipated volumes. 
Moving to our operating expenses. In total, GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $95.9 million or 26.8% of revenues compared to $77.7 million or 23% of revenue in the prior quarter and to $92.7 million or 22.2% of revenues for the same quarter last year. A major part of the increase this quarter is a result of stock-based compensation. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $72.9 million or 20.4% of revenues compared to $63.2 million or 18.7% of revenues in the prior quarter and $63.1 million or 15.1% of revenues for the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 18.9% compared to 16.7% last quarter. 
Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $14.4 million compared to $30.4 million in the previous quarter and $50.5 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $43.5 million compared to $50 million in the previous quarter and $85.3 million for the same period last year. 
This quarter, non-GAAP solar activities resulted in operating profit of $56.5 million compared to an operating profit of $56.7 million last quarter. This number represents 17.3% of our solar revenues and is slightly lower than our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. The nonsolar activity resulted in a non-GAAP operating loss of $13 million compared to an operating loss of $6.6 million in the previous quarter, mainly from our e-Mobility division. 
Financial income for the quarter was $10.4 million compared to financial income of $15.8 million in the previous quarter and financial income of $11.1 million for the same period last year. This income is a result of foreign currency changes, offset by increased finance expenses related to the accounting treatment of our convertible debt and leases. Tax expense was $7.2 million this quarter compared to a tax expense of $2.4 million in the prior quarter and $9.2 million for the same period last year. 
Our non-GAAP tax expense was $4.6 million compared to $1.6 million in the previous quarter and $10.4 million for the same period last year. Our tax rate is positively affected in the last quarters by higher deductible expenses for tax purposes resulting from exercise of employees' stock compensation. 
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $17.7 million compared to a GAAP net income of $43.8 million in the previous quarter and $52.8 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income was $55.7 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $65.9 million in the previous quarter and $87.4 million for the same quarter last year. 
GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.33 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.83 in the previous quarter and $1.03 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.98 compared to $1.21 in the previous quarter and $1.65 in the same quarter last year. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $530.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated $27 million in cash from operations. AR net increased nominally this quarter to $218.7 million compared to $183.1 million last quarter. DSO this quarter in the solar business was 75 days, an increase from 70 days last quarter. 
As of December 31, 2020, our inventory level net of reserves was at $331.7 million compared to $297 million in the prior quarter. A substantial portion of this growth is attributed to an increase in raw material inventory in anticipation of start-up production in our e-Mobility division, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our finished goods in the solar business. 
Let's move now to summarize the full year of 2020. Revenues for the year were $1.46 billion, a 2.4% increase from $1.43 billion in the calendar year 2019. Revenues related to our solar business were $1.36 billion, a 1.5% increase compared to 2019. GAAP gross margin was 31.6% compared to 33.6% in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33% compared to 34.9% in the prior year. GAAP net income for 2020 was $140.3 million, a 4.2% decrease compared to $146.6 million in the prior year and GAAP diluted EPS of $2.66 compared to $2.90 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for 2020 was $224.4 million, a 3.5% decrease compared to $233.2 million in 2019 and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.11 compared to $4.44 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for our solar business was $264 million, a 4% increase compared to $254.1 million in 2019. This year, we generated $222.7 million in cash from operations. 
Moving now to guidance for the first quarter of 2021. We expect revenues in the first quarter to be within the range of $385 million to $405 million. Revenues from the sale of solar products are expected to be within the range of $360 million and $375 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 34% to 36%. Non-GAAP gross margin from solar activities is expected to be within the range of 36% to 38%.

You need to understand that there is a big difference, as you can see, and it's growing between the GAAP and non-GAAP.

You need to understand that there is a big difference, as you can see, and it's growing between the GAAP and non-GAAP. A lot of it is related to the stock-based compensation given the fact that stock price hiked so much. And therefore, these expenses are representing a bigger portion. 
But in general, I would start by saying that the way that we would like to see gross margins in a way that allows us to be between 20% to 23% of operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. So that means that we are aiming at around 15%, 16% of non-GAAP operating expenses coming for the solar business. 
Now I think that we need to differentiate here between the solar and the nonsolar business. In the solar business, the revenues are relatively high. And as long as we are able to maintain growth rates, the numbers of the revenues and the impact is going to be so large that you should see an operational level where when the numbers are growing, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues will go down. 
We continue to invest in R&D as much as we can. Today, it's hard to broaden much more or as quick as we would like, the R&D, simply given the fact that we already have a base of many people. So therefore, to get many people in a short time is an issue. 
On sales and marketing and G&A, there are economies of scale. And therefore, we should expect to see this operating leverage continuing. The issue -- and the big question is usually around the newer businesses because these are businesses that are in a, I would call it, investment mode. And naturally, we would like to invest there in R&D or market development. 
So for example, in the e-mobility space, we definitely want to increase the product selection, and we want to go to newer generation. In general there, I would assume that you may see a situation where the growth in operating expenses is similar to the growth that you will see in the revenues. But when you tie everything together with the solar that is so much bigger than the others, again, you should see that in the overall picture, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses should decline over time."

And this is basically a result of several things. The first one is the fact that we start to see the United States being back, a more meaningful portion of our revenues -- of the solar revenues. As we mentioned before, actually at the end of Q2, what we saw is that when the pandemic started and the U.S. market was hit, we were able to grow substantially in Europe that in a way -- that, on one hand, did not impact the revenues maybe as much as it would hit unless we were so active in Europe, but at the same time, the higher competition and intensity in Europe prescribed much lower gross margins. And at that time, by the way, we have -- I noted there's about a 500 basis point difference between the U.S. and Europe in this regard. 
Over time, 2 things happened. The first thing is that the euro got a little bit stronger compared to the U.S. dollar. This is something that, of course, helps our margins in the sense that we still manufacture in dollars, and therefore, we collect more dollars on every euro sale that we're doing. And the second one is that once we're starting to sell in the United States, where the competition is a little bit lower on residential due to the rapid shutdown regulations, then we were able to charge higher revenues than to increase the margin. 
And there is another issue that happened in the fourth quarter, and this is the fact that, in general, commercial solar that is characterized with lower gross margins compared to residential was again lower compared to the previous quarters. So this is the main change that happened. 
Looking forward, as already described in our guidance, we expected the non-GAAP gross margin to be at 36% to 38%. So the midpoint is already at the higher range of our long-term target. And we expect this to continue to happen. We continue to do cost reduction all the time. The pricing environment is relatively stable both in the United States and in Europe. And we are continuing all the time to shift more and more production to a non-Chinese manufacturing, at least the production that comes to the United States. And compared to 60% of shipments of non-Chinese products in Q4, about 85% of these products that will come to the U.S. in Q1 will be already from non-tariffs. So this is something that definitely drives us to the higher range and the higher levels that we guided. 
There is one phenomena, though, that we need to mention, and this is actually for the later part of the year. While we assume that we will see the normalization in the solar margins in Q1 and Q2, actually, in Q3, once batteries are starting to get bigger volumes and starting to have more effect on our margins. And here, in the past, we discussed approximately 25% expected margins on batteries, we expect that the overall portion of batteries in the revenues mix will drive this margin a little bit down. 
So in general, we are normalizing in solar without batteries. Once batteries will come, we will basically provide guidance a little bit about how to model and how to expect gross margins to be related to the volume of batteries of the overall revenues."

In general, we expect -- volumes will initiate this quarter, and we believe that they will stabilize around Q2 or beginning of Q2 towards the end of the year. So I would assume that the majority of the revenues will come between Q2 to Q4. And that means that at that point, in Q2, we already expect to see positive gross margin on this product. 
However, I think that we need to differentiate between the longer-term margins that we expect on e-Mobility and the margins on this project. And the 2 key differentiators is, first of all, the fact that in e-Mobility, unlike in solar, it's very hard to do cost reduction once the product is defined, nevertheless, if it was launched or not. Because in the e-mobility space, once you have defined the product and you basically validated the product with the manufacturer, you cannot change any component. And that, of course, reduces dramatically your ability to either make changes in the product for cost reduction or even to negotiate with your suppliers because they know that they're already designed into the product. 
In the case of this e-Ducato project, it's a product -- project that we inherited from the acquisition of SMRE. And therefore, there is not a lot that we can do in this specific product to reduce cost. And we expect to see single-digit margins starting in Q2, and they will not be very high. 
Once -- we will see 2 things happening. First of all, if indeed the market acceptance is going to be good for this product, then we will see higher volumes, and then we will be able to spread the fixed costs that we already have here over a larger amount of units. And this, of course, will increase the gross margin. And second, we will be able, maybe over time when we'll have more projects, to go and reduce cost of product if we're using them -- or components if you use them in other products as well because then we have more leverage with the suppliers. But in any case, I do not expect it to happen -- not in 2021 and not in the volumes that we're discussing right now. 
Lastly, 30% is -- I do not believe that this is a number that can be achieved in the near future in e-Mobility. If you look today at comparable companies in the e-mobility space, you see best margins being at about 18%, and these are very technological and very good companies. It will take us the time to get to that level of expertise. But at the same time, you usually see that the cost per unit is high enough that the overall contribution to profitability, even if the margin is lower, is very high because every unit is very expensive. So I hope that it answered all of the components. If not, let me know what I missed."

To the second question, as I said earlier, we've been commenting about this opportunity and the fact that it is coming close in the last couple of quarters. And we're confident enough to be more clear about it in this call. So at this point, we are not on the verge of any additional project, definitely not a project at this scale within the next couple of quarters. So there won't be quick wins and quick ramps and multiple projects, at least not in 2021 here."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. Starting with highlights of our first quarter results.
We concluded the quarter with revenues of approximately $405 million, just above the top end of our guidance. Revenues from our solar business were $376 million, while revenue from our nonsolar business were $29 million. This quarter, we shipped 3.7 million power optimizers and 182,000 inverters.
Our solar business grew this quarter across all segments and geographies, including record quarterly revenues in Australia, Italy and France. In North America, we saw a 23% growth in revenues from Q4 to Q1, representing increased demand for both residential and commercial products. Business in Europe is continuing to grow led by sales in the Netherlands, where we had a record quarter of residential revenues, as well as revenues from Germany, Italy and Poland. Also noteworthy is our continued growth in France where we had record quarter, both in residential and commercial sales.
In the region outside Europe and the U.S., which includes Australia, Asia Pacific, Japan, Brazil, Israel and several other countries, we had our third consecutive quarter of growth and record shipments. Noteworthy among these countries is Australia, where we delivered close to 100 megawatts of products representing more than 50% of quarter-over-quarter growth. A big part of this momentum was due to the volume shipments of our new rephased residential inverter optimized for the Australia markets.
When it comes to new market opportunities, we see Korea as a particularly interesting one. We recently completed certification of our 3-phase commercial inverter for installation on commercial rooftops in Korea. As the C&I market in Korea is more than 2 gigawatts in size and considering our strong local presence, we are optimistic about the growth potential there. And indeed already installed in the first quarter, more than 10 megawatts of rooftops in a conditional certification setup.
As we projected in recent calls, this quarter, we began to see meaningful signs of recovery in our commercial business across all regions. Our megawatt shipments of commercial products grew by 35% from last quarter. As we have anticipated and discussed in our last earnings calls, the commercial sector has been slower to recover from the economic downturn during the pandemic, but inventory in our distribution channel is now back to healthier levels. And we are seeing a pickup in commercial installations and opportunity pipeline. We expect revenues from the commercial segment to continue and grow back to the prepandemic levels in the second and third quarter of 2021.
On the product side, demand for our battery-ready energy hub inverter continues to grow, and it is now more than 20% of our residential shipments to the U.S. At the same time, we see growing interest in our self-consumption devices, such as our EV charger and water-heating products. Our plan to launch our residential battery remains on track. We have active test sites already in the U.S. and will begin initial shipments this quarter. These batteries will be shipped to the U.S., Europe and later to Australia. The test period is aimed to validate the battery performance in the field and sharpen installation practices with the health of some of our select installers. Additionally, the goal is to confirm the system-level battery plus energy hub inverter, self-consumption and backup scenarios.
In a recent study of our global installed base of more than 30,000 systems of SolarEdge backup inverters installed with third-party inverter, we analyze consumer behavior patterns and system performance through more than 75,000 blackout events lasting more than 5 minutes. We characterized in detail typical blackout frequencies, duration, the power and energy capacity needs as well as practices to prevent depletion of batteries and extended blackout events. We will be incorporating these learnings into our system in conjunction with the maximization of self-consumption and financial decision-making algorithms in order to enable smart, automated system decisions, and provide a flexible, easy-to-manage system for the consumer.
As we have said in the past, we don't plan for meaningful battery revenues until Q3 of this year. Given the growing demand for energy consumption and storage, which I referred to earlier, we are confident that our storage-ready inverters fitted with our DC-coupled battery represent a significant milestone in progressing our vision of a home system that is flexible to provide both maximization of self-consumption and economic value, where relevant, and backup capability where and when needed.
In the commercial segment, we see good adoption of our 120-kilowatt energy inverter, including a dedicated version for ground mount installations in the U.S. This new high-power inverter is designed to support bigger commercial fields and improved economics as well as simplify installation and commissioning. Our customers can now set up and test the entire installation before even connecting to the AC grid.
As the C&I market continues to improve, our new high-power inverter, combined with our recently released 1,100 watt optimizer, offer a means to reduce the cost per watt for installers and increase adoption of our solution in larger ground-mount and rooftop installation.
I would like now to elaborate on our operational status. Cycles of component shortages are common in our industry, and we have experienced such cycles before. Based on our past experience, we have adopted the methodology to closely monitor the procurement of components by our contract manufacturers and at times, manage the supply and demand of components directly from their suppliers. This allows us to identify relatively early cycles of shortages. We also typically hold high levels of safety stock and finished goods inventory that allow us to overcome temporary fluctuations of component availability. In addition, we have developed alternate sources for critical components.
As a result, at this time, based on the current alignment and delivery schedules with our contract manufacturers and suppliers, we are comfortable in our ability to support the increased demand we are seeing and our projections for further demand increases later in the year. Though at times, this may come at a higher cost due to expedited shipments and cost increase as is reflected in our gross margin guidance for the forthcoming quarter.
On a related note, our Sella factory in Israel is continuing to ramp. We are now employing over 480 workers and manufacturing inverters and optimizers from our own facility, which is on track to reach full capacity by end of this quarter. The fruits of this investment are already being born as thanks to a joint project of our R&D and operational teams in Israel, we have been able to increase the output of our power optimizer automated assembly line and copied this improved process to our contract manufacturers in other locations.
In our nonsolar business, our e-Mobility division began delivering full powertrain units and batteries for the Fiat I Ducato in Europe. The ramp of the production line will be gradual and several months will pass until we reach full capacity.
In our Energy Storage division, the Sella 2 factory for lithium-ion cells and batteries in Korea is now well underway with the groundbreaking work behind us and building establishment and process. The factory is expected to start pilot production in the first half of 2022 and will enable us to supply our own sales and reduce our dependency on third-party manufacturers.
In summary, we are happy with the results of the first quarter and with the progress our teams are making across our regions and business units.
With this, I hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

Total revenues for the first quarter were $405.5 million, a 13% increase compared to $358.1 million last quarter and a 6% decrease compared to $431.2 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the sale of solar products were $376.4 million, a 15% increase compared to $327.1 million last quarter. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $162.5 million and represented 43.2% of our solar revenues.
Solar revenues from Europe were $158.4 million or 42.1% of our revenues, and the rest of the world, solar revenues were $85.5 million or 14.7% of Our total revenues, driven mostly by a record revenues in Australia. Revenue this quarter represented strong demand for our products in both residential and commercial segments in Europe and the rest of the world, with revenues in the United States continuing to be driven by sales of residential products.
On a megawatt basis, we shipped to the United States 573 megawatts, to Europe 721 megawatts and to the rest of the world, 397 megawatts. 45% of the total amount were commercial products and the remaining 55% are residential. Channel inventory remains healthy in all regions in anticipation for Q2 and Q3, which are typically characterized as stronger quarters for the solar industry in general, point-of-sale data received from our distributors demonstrate strength in all regions. In the United States, where commercial sales were weaker over the last quarter, we see as anticipated, strong point-of-sale data, which lowers the inventory days within the channels and new project discussions with our customers are expected to yield an increase in our U.S. commercial sales in Q2 and the following quarters.
This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 62.2% of our solar revenues. One U.S. distributor accounted for more than 10% of the solar revenues. Pricing level remained stable this quarter across all regions. Blended ASP per watt for our solar products decreased by approximately 8% compared to the last quarter, driven by customer and product mix. This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar products were $29.1 million, led by sales of lithium-ion batteries to nonsolar customers by Kokam, and increased sales from our e-mobility business that delivered first full parter in kits to Stellantis.
GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 34.5% and compared to 30.8% in the prior quarter and 32.5% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 36.5% compared to 32.5% in the prior quarter and 33.6% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the solar business was a record 39.7% compared to 36.2% in the last quarter and above our long-term solar gross margin target of 36% plus/minus 1%. This increase in the non-GAAP solar margin is a result of several factors.
Primarily, we saw a higher portion of residential products, which are characterized by higher gross margins out of the total product mix, improved exchange rate on sales in Europe and Australia, a reduction in the portion of Chinese-made products shipped to the United States and that are subject to U.S. custom tariffs as well as lower warranty charges as a percentage of revenues associated with the support of our product and economies of scale. 86% of the products shipped to the United States this quarter were not subject to the said tariffs as they were manufactured outside of China.
As you can see from our Q2 gross margin guidance, we expect margins to be slightly lower in the coming quarter. Over the last quarters, we experienced a substantial increase in ocean freight prices as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on trade and supply chains. Ocean freight prices have increased by more than 100% over the last months, and our prenegotiated prices have gradually expired and exposed us to higher freight cost worldwide.
Another element that affects our margin is increased cost of certain components and freight costs related to the expedited shipments of such components. As Zvi mentioned, We are managing these component shortages in a way that currently allows us to meet the annual operating plan, but such management requires us from time to time to pay higher price for component or air shipped them to our contract manufacturer's facility as supply times as also fluctuate.
Lastly, the seasonal growth in revenues in Europe and increased sales of commercial products in the United States. Both are characterized by lower gross margin products in our overall mix. Despite all these factors, our gross margin target and our expectation to meet it remain unchanged at the range of 36% plus/minus 1%.
Non-GAAP gross margin for our nonsolar activities was minus 4.7% compared to minus 6.4% in the previous quarter. The improvement is mainly a result of the growing volumes of powertrain kits supplied this quarter, although volumes are not yet stabilized at the anticipated level that will get us to the low single-digit target gross margin on this project.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the first quarter were $76.2 million or 18.8% of revenues compared to $72.9 million or 20.4% of revenues in the prior quarter and $66.3 million or 15.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This increase is a result of our recommenced investment in talent acquisition in our research and development department as well as the expansion of sales infrastructure in all businesses.
Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 17% compared to 18.9% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $71.9 million compared to $43.5 million in the previous quarter and $78.6 million for the same period last year. This quarter, non-GAAP solar activities resulted in an operating profit of $85.5 million compared to an operating profit of $56.5 million last quarter. This number represents 22.7% of our solar revenues and is at the higher end of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model.
The nonsolar activities resulted in non-GAAP operating loss of $13.6 million, relatively flat to an operating loss of $13 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP financial expense for the quarter was $6.3 million compared to a non-GAAP financial income of $16.9 million in the previous quarter. This expense is a result of mostly unrealized foreign currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans between the group companies.
Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $4.6 million in the previous quarter and $12.5 million for the same period last year. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $30.1 million compared to a GAAP net income of $17.7 million in the previous quarter and $42.2 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $55.5 million, flat compared to a non-GAAP net income of $55.7 million in the previous quarter. However, this net income this quarter is a result of a substantially higher operating profit.
GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.55 for the first quarter compared to $0.33 in the previous quarter and $0.81 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $0.98, the same as in the previous quarter and a slight increase compared to $0.95 in the same quarter last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $515.2 million. During the first quarter of 2021, we generated $24.1 million in cash from operations. AR net increased nominally this quarter to $271.7 million compared to $219.7 million last quarter. Debt sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 73 days, a decrease from 75 days last quarter.
As of March 31, our inventory level, net of reserves, was at $340 million compared to $331.7 million in the prior quarter. This amount reflects slightly lower finished good inventories and higher raw material inventory in both our solar and nonsolar businesses as we are working through the component shortages and ramp up our e-mobility powertrain production line.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter of 2021. We expect revenues for the second quarter to be within the range of $445 million to $465 million. Revenues from the sale of solar products are expected to be within the range of $405 million and $420 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 32% to 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the sale of solar products is expected to be within the range of 36% to 38%.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions."

So therefore, spotting one specific element is always a little bit more complicated and one of them may move and actually overcast the other, such as exchange rate, for example. But from a perspective related to the logistic costs, basically, our prices are usually prenegotiated in advance. And we try to close them as much as possible in order to hedge prices against changes that are happening. And we were able actually to do it pretty well in the last few quarters. It's simply that over time, the costs went up and our prices elapsed and therefore, we had to pay the higher prices. 
So right now, I think that we have a pretty clear visibility for the ocean freight prices, at least for the quarter where we guided. We do not see a lot of changes happening there. I think that for the quarters to come, we do not have yet numbers to see. We believe that the trend is going to be slightly downwards. But of course, as long as the traffic of boats in and out from the United States and to China and the other areas is somehow disturbed because of COVID and because of changes in the trade patterns, this may change. We do not expect major changes more than we saw this quarter, however, in the next few quarters."

The biggest growth will come starting next year because once Sella 2 will start producing cell, this will be first sample sales in the first quarter and go into full production within the year. Then our expectation was around $300 million as we communicated in the past. However, we do see that this assumption that was based on relatively large ASP erosion in the cell industry is not really materializing, and therefore, the effect could be higher.

So Europe was an interesting winter in the fact that the first couple of months were pretty tough winter and installation rates were kind of slow. And then sometime from mid-February and on, things opened up and installation rate is gone up, sell-through is gone up. And most of our dialogues with our distributors across Europe, both for residential and commercial are about pull-ins and expedite these days as the market woke up very aggressively and inventory levels are relatively low compared to the pull from the installers.
In terms of the general breakdown, if that's what you're referring to. So we are stabilizing more on a 40%, 45% U.S., 40% roughly Europe and 15% rest of world. Rest of world is growing quite quickly, and that pattern might shift later on, and we are investing a lot into places like Korea that I mentioned, Taiwan, that is is a good growing market. Thailand is a good growing and interesting market as well as the other places that we are present already like in a strong way like Australia and in Brazil and even in our home court in Israel. So the growth rate in these regions of the market are higher than that in the U.S. and in Europe, and we are making the investments in order to capitalize it. Still, nonetheless, for the foreseeable future, that mix of roughly -- or going depending on the season between 40% to 50% each between Europe and the U.S. and the rest coming from the rest of the world is probably going to be the pattern for the next 12 to 18 months continuously."

I would say that in this quarter, first of all, as I've laid out, if you take the midrange of our guidance, we're supposed to be at around 37% on the mid-range, which wins about 200 basis points of reduction compared to this quarter. This actually encapsulates the vast majority of all of them because the ocean freight is usually, I would say several -- I would say, not more than 100 to 150 basis points in general, usually, but again, these kind of expenses almost doubled over the last quarter. But this is something that, again, that is changing based on the routes that you're shipping, whether you ship more from Europe, whether you ship more from China and Vietnam, and there are a lot of fluctuations there. And you see a relatively large number.
The exchange rate differences, of course, are hard to predict. This quarter, they were above the usual rate, but at the end, they worked a little bit against us.

So Maheep, as I mentioned in the comments, our commercial volume in megawatts from Q4 to Q1, grew by about 35%. This was primarily growth in Europe and rest of the world. Our commercial shipments also in the U.S. grew quarter-over-quarter but to a lesser effect, and they grew quarter-over-quarter in the other 2 regions as we characterize them, Europe and Australia. At the same time, we began to see also in the U.S. higher installation rates and sales by our distributors and reduction in inventory levels. So we do believe that the U.S. will begin to pick up as well following the pickup that we saw in Australia and rest of world, not necessarily at that growth rate. So we are -- and we referred to this a few times in the past, we expected, barring the improvement from the economies and related to the pandemic, we expected the beginning of pickup in the second quarter. And usually, commercial installations are back-end heavy in the year. So it is a reasonable assumption that the commercial shipments will continue to improve globally and in particular, in the U.S., as I mentioned."

We manufacture at 5 sites, in multiple locations around the world, and we deliver to many countries and optimize continuously based on various elements. And that's not a simple operation. And I can give you an example in the Suez crisis of a month ago, we had more than 100 containers of products that were stuck in this congestion, some of which were on the actual boat that was blocking the canal and some were at both sides of the canal. Nonetheless, with all of that going on, we -- our delivery dates were intact and our customer deliveries were not delayed because the complexity also gives us many options and a lot of levers to play with. And we were able, with some expedition and a lot of effort to still satisfy the demand and meet our obligations. So we -- I think we're pretty good at this, and we -- with all the challenges ahead, we believe that we will be able to execute on the demand both from a component availability and the logistics constraints that are out there today."

It's more actually the inventory days that they're holding, and that means for how long they can basically supply based on the inventories that they have. Now in general, I can tell you that, first of all, as Zvi mentioned, from a component and from a logistics point of view, we did not face any trouble deliver a product, and therefore, we will not -- we were able to supply whatever demand came. When the vendors are looking at their inventory, each of them make their decisions based on what they see and project. And in general, what you see is that towards the end of the first quarter, the absolute number or the absolute value of inventory is growing in the channels because everyone is getting ready for Q2 and Q3. And also, of course, the more you hear about component shortages in the market, the more you hear about complexities of companies to provide at time you see those, I would call it, distributors trying to optimize the level of inventory that they're holding, which is something that cost the money in working capital with, I would call it, desire to get as much stability by simply holding the inventory. 
So in essence, what we see right now is that when we talk to our distributors, we're very well aligned with them on the lead times. As Zvi mentioned, even if there are logistic hurdles, we're able to meet the delivery times and we're able to communicate them well to the distributors, and we let them to understand and decide what is the level that they have. This also means, by the way, that we don't see a drag of orders coming or pulling forward simply to make sure that we have or they have more inventories that -- and something that can affect them later. So it's a kind of a, I would call it, circular process where the joint planning for us and them allows them to plan well the inventory, our ability to deliver related to all the hurdles and the complexities on time is something that make them comfortable, which in turn allows them to be more precise in the way that they are planning the inventory and the inventory levels.
Right now, at least, we see a normal behavior for this time of the year. And again, we do not believe that there is any pull-ins or any deliveries that are done now simply in order to secure that they have inventories for the rest of the year."

It is something that we are paying attention to at many levels. And generally, over the years, it was -- was considered relative strength of ours, our position with the large installation companies. And some of that strength was coming from a lot of joint efforts to help their installation efficiency. And our -- the importance we were putting in it and the willingness to discuss these type of items and working together on how we help them, in some cases, in our small part. Obviously, the big issue is theirs in terms of increase the amount of installations that can be done per day or reduce the amount of time per installation. And there are things that have been done over the years in terms of integration of elements that prior used to be installed separately and incorporating them into the inverter. And other elements of reducing time of commissioning and downloading software and things like that. So in all of those areas, we are investing a lot of R&D and doing that in cooperation with some of the large customers that we work with, both in residential and C&I.
There are, as you suggest, there are also opportunities that are more related to the overall balance of system of installations and the direction that things are going more in C&I. We are investing again R&D and looking at these type of opportunities. And it's an area that we have a team that is focused on, again, it's not something to get into right now, but we concur that this is an area of growing importance in terms of the growth of the industry and the adoption of these type of solutions around the world."

And it's a trend that we plan to continue and exercise also in some of our other businesses.
The broader topic of the question is indeed -- and I think it's a good sign for our industry is the entrance of big technology players that are seeing renewables and solar and PV in particular, as growth opportunities and has significant opportunities that are here to stay. So we welcome that, and I think it's good for all of us. I think we are pretty aware of our strengths and at the same time, aware of our weaknesses. And now that we are in the e-mobility space, in some of the areas, it also allows us to compare ourselves to other companies from other industries and realize that if you take the specific topics of power electronics and high efficiency, high reliability power electronics and the ability to mass produce high-quality, high-efficient power electronics, that's what we know how to do. That is the core of the strength of the company. And we feel good about our capability and talent in compared to most companies that we came across, and we came across some of the very well-known names around the world in this area.

And therefore, there is an expectation that at least in the short term, gross margin will be there. Now it will not be there, maybe much higher at the very beginning due to the fact that you still need to ramp up. There are economies of scale related to the way that you ramp up, but we definitely see a potential to be there.
I think that the next layer of potential is actually once we have our Sella 2 factory, and this is something that will come at the later part of in '22 when batteries from Sella 2 will start arriving because at that point, we will have our own factory with our own cost and with our own supply chain, meaning that we do not need to leave margin maybe with the hands of a third party as well.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call.
Starting with highlights of our first quarter results. We concluded the quarter with revenues of approximately $405 million, just above the top end of our guidance. Revenues from our solar business were $376 million, while revenue from our nonsolar business were $29 million. This quarter, we shipped 3.7 million power optimizers and 182,000 inverters.
Our solar business grew this quarter across all segments and geographies, including record quarterly revenues in Australia, Italy and France. In North America, we saw 23% growth in revenues from Q4 to Q1, representing increased demand for both residential and commercial products. Business in Europe is continuing to grow, led by sales in the Netherlands where we had a record quarter of residential revenues; as well as revenues from Germany, Italy and Poland. Also noteworthy is our continued growth in France, where we had record quarter both in residential and commercial sales.
In the region outside Europe and the U.S., which includes Australia, Asia Pacific, Japan, Brazil, Israel and several other countries, we had our third consecutive quarter of growth and record shipments. Noteworthy among these countries is Australia, where we delivered close to 100 megawatts of products, representing more than 50% of quarter-over-quarter growth. A big part of this momentum was due to the volume shipments of our new 3-phase residential inverter optimized for the Australian market. When it comes to new market opportunities, we see Korea as a particularly interesting one. We recently completed certification of our 3-phase commercial inverter, for installation on commercial rooftops in Korea. As the C&I market in Korea is more than 2 gigawatt in size and considering our strong local presence, we are optimistic about the growth potential there and indeed already installed in the first quarter more than 10 megawatt of rooftops in a conditional certification setup.
As we projected in recent calls, this quarter, we began to see meaningful signs of recovery in our commercial business across all regions. Our megawatt shipments of commercial products grew by 30 -- 35% from last quarter. As we have anticipated and discussed in our last earning calls, the commercial sector has been slower to recover from the economic downturn during the pandemic, but inventory in our distribution channel is now back to healthier levels. And we are seeing a pickup in commercial installations and opportunity pipeline. We expect revenues from the commercial segments to continue and grow back to the pre-pandemic levels in the second and third quarter of 2021.
On the products side, demand for our battery-ready energy hub inverter continues to grow, and it is now more than 20% of our residential shipments to the U.S. At the same time, we see growing interest in our self-consumption devices such as our EV charger and water-heating product. Our plan to launch our residential battery remains on track. We have active test sites already in the U.S. and will begin initial shipments this quarter. These batteries will be shipped to the U.S., Europe and later to Australia. The test period is aimed to validate the battery performance in the field and sharpen installation practices with the help of some of our select installers. Additionally, the goal is to confirm the system-level battery plus energy hub inverter self-consumption and backup scenarios.
In a recent study of our global installed base of more than 30,000 systems of SolarEdge backup inverters installed with third-party inverter, we analyzed consumer behavior patterns and system performance through more than 75,000 blackout events lasting more than 5 minutes. We characterized in detail typical blackout frequencies, duration; the power and energy capacity needs; as well as practices to prevent depletion of batteries in extended blackout events. We will be incorporating these learnings into our system in conjunction with the maximization of self-consumption and financial decision-making algorithms in order to enable smart, automated system decisions; and provide a flexible, easy-to-manage system for the consumer.
As we have said in the past, we don't plan for meaningful battery revenues until Q3 of this year. Given the growing demand for energy consumption and storage, which I referred to earlier, we are confident that our storage-ready inverters fitted with our DC-coupled battery represent a significant milestone in progressing our vision of a home system that is flexible to provide both maximization of self-consumption and economic value where relevant and backup capability where and when needed. In the commercial segment, we see good adoption of our 120 kilowatts energy inverter, including a dedicated version for ground-mount installations in the U.S. This new high-power inverter is designed to support bigger commercial fields and improved economics as well as simplify installation and commissioning. Our customers can now set up and test the entire installation before even connecting to the AC grid.
As the C&I market continues to improve, our new high-power inverter, combined with our recently released 1,100-watt optimizer, offer a means to reduce the cost per watt for installers and increase adoption of our solution in larger ground-mount and rooftop installations.
I would like now to elaborate on our operational status. Cycles of component shortages are common in our industry and we have experienced such cycles before. Based on our past experience, we have adopted a methodology to closely monitor the procurement of components by our contract manufacturers and at times manage the supply and demand of components directly from their suppliers. This allows us to identify relatively early cycles of shortages. We also typically hold high levels of safety stock and finished goods inventory that allow us to overcome temporary fluctuations of component availability. In addition, we have developed alternate sources for critical components. As a result, at this time, based on the current alignment and delivery schedules with our contract manufacturers and suppliers, we are comfortable in our ability to support the increased demand we are seeing and our projections for further demand increases later in the year, though at times this may come at a higher cost due to expedited shipments and cost increase, as is reflected in our gross margin guidance for the forthcoming quarter.
On a related note, our Sella 1 factory in Israel is continuing to ramp. We are now employing over 480 workers and manufacturing inverters and optimizers from our own facility, which is on track to reach full capacity by end of this quarter. The fruits of this investment are already being born, as thanks to a joint project of our R&D and operational teams in Israel, we have been able to increase the output of our power optimizer automated assembly line and copied this improved process to our contract manufacturers in other locations.
In our nonsolar business, our e-Mobility division began delivering full powertrain units and batteries for the Fiat E-Ducato in Europe. The ramp of the production line will be gradual, and several months will pass until we reach full capacity. In our energy storage division, the Sella 2 factory for lithium-ion cells and batteries in Korea is now well underway, with the groundbreaking work behind us and building establishment in process. The factory is expected to start pilot production in the first half of 2022 and will enable us to supply our own cells and reduce our dependency on third-party manufacturers.
In summary, we are happy with the results of the first quarter and with the progress our teams are making across our regions and business units.
With this, I hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

This financial review includes a GAAP and non-GAAP discussion. Full reconciliation of the pro forma to GAAP results discussed on this call is available on our website and in the press release issued today.
Total revenues for the first quarter were $405.5 million, a 13% increase compared to $358.1 million last quarter and a 6% decrease compared to $431.2 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the sale of solar products were $376.4 million, a 15% increase compared to $327.1 million last quarter.
U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $162.5 million and represented 43.2% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were $158.4 million or 42.1% of our revenues. And the rest of the world solar revenues were $55.5 million or 14.7% of our total revenues, driven mostly by record revenues in Australia.
Revenue this quarter represented strong demand for our products in both residential and commercial segments in Europe and the rest of the world, with revenues in the United States continuing to be driven by sales of residential products. On a megawatt basis, we shipped to the United States 573 megawatts, to Europe 721 megawatts and to the rest of the world 397 megawatts. 45% of the total amount were commercial products and the remaining 55% are residential.
Channel inventory remained healthy in all regions in anticipation for Q2 and Q3, which are typically characterized as stronger quarters for the solar industry in general. Point of data sale -- point-of-sale data received from our distributors demonstrate strength in all regions. In the United States, where commercial sales were weaker over the last quarter, we see as anticipated strong point-of-sale data, which lowers the inventory days within the channels. And new project discussions with our customers are expected to yield an increase in our U.S. commercial sales in Q2 and the following quarters. This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 62.2% of our solar revenues. One U.S. distributor accounted for more than 10% of the solar revenues.
Pricing levels remained stable this quarter across all regions. Blended ASP per watt for our solar products decreased by approximately 8% compared to the last quarter, driven by customer and product mix.
This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar products were $29.1 million, led by sales of lithium-ion batteries to nonsolar customers by Kokam and increased sales from our e-Mobility business that delivered first full powertrain kits to Stellantis.
GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 34.5% compared to 30.8% in the prior quarter and 32.5% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 36.5% compared to 32.5% in the prior quarter and 33.6% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the solar business was a record 39.7% compared to 36.2% in the last quarter and above our long-term solar gross margin target of 36% plus, minus 1%.
This increase in the non-GAAP solar margin is a result of several factors. Primarily, we saw a higher portion of residential products which are characterized by higher gross margins out of the total product mix, improved exchange rate on sales in Europe and Australia, a reduction in the portion of Chinese-made products shipped to the United States and that are subject to U.S. custom tariff as well as lower warranty charges as a percentage of revenues associated with the support of our products and economies of scale. 86% of the products shipped to the United States this quarter were not subject to the said tariffs, as they were manufactured outside of China.
As you can see from our Q2 gross margin guidance, we expect margins to be slightly lower in the coming quarter. Over the last quarters, we experienced substantial increase in ocean freight prices as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on trade and supply chains. Ocean freight prices have increased by more than 100% over the last months, and our prenegotiated prices have gradually expired and exposed us to higher freights costs worldwide. Another element that affect our margin is increased costs of certain components and freight costs related to the expedited shipments of such components. As Zvi mentioned, we are managing these component shortages in a way that currently allows us to meet the annual operating plan, but such management requires us from time to time to pay higher prices for component or air-ship them to our contract manufacturer's facility as supply times always -- also fluctuate. Lastly, the seasonal growth in revenues in Europe and increased sales of commercial products in the United States both are characterized by lower gross margins products in our overall mix. Despite all these factors, our gross margin target and our expectation to meet it remain unchanged at the range of 36% plus, minus 1%.
Non-GAAP gross margin for our nonsolar activities was minus 4.7% compared to minus 6.4% in the previous quarter. The improvement is mainly a result of the growing volumes of powertrain kits supplied this quarter, although volumes are not yet stabilized at the anticipated level that will get us to the low single digits target gross margin on this project.
Our -- on a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the first quarter were $76.2 million or 18.8% of revenues compared to $72.9 million or 20.4% of revenues in the prior quarter and $66.3 million or 14 -- 15.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This increase is a result of our recommenced investment in talent acquisition in our research and development department as well as the expansion of sales infrastructure in all businesses.
Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as percentage of solar revenues were 17% compared to 18.9% last quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $71.9 million compared to $43.5 million in the previous quarter and $78.6 million for the same period last year. This quarter, non-GAAP solar activities resulted in an operating profit of $85.5 million compared to an operating profit of $56.5 million last quarter. This number represent 22.7% of our solar revenues and is at the higher end of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model.
The nonsolar activities resulted in non-GAAP operating loss of $13.6 million, relatively flat to an operating loss of $13 million in the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP financial expense for the quarter was $6.3 million compared to a non-GAAP financial income of $16.9 million in the previous quarter. This expense is a result of mostly unrealized foreign currencies fluctuations related to intercompany loans between the group companies.
Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $4.6 million in the previous quarter and $12.5 million for the same period last year.
GAAP net income for the first quarter was $30.1 million compared to a GAAP net income of $17.7 million in the previous quarter and $42.2 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $55.5 million, flat compared to a non-GAAP net income of $55.7 million in the previous quarter. However, this net income this quarter is a result of a substantially higher operating profit.
GAAP net diluted earning per share was $0.55 for the first quarter compared to $0.33 in the previous quarter and $0.81 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $0.98, the same as in the previous quarter and a slight increase compared to $0.95 in the same quarter last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet.
As of March 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposit, restricted bank deposits and investments were $515.2 million.
During the first quarter of 2021, we generated $24.1 million in cash from operations. AR net increased nominally this quarter to $271.7 million compared to $218.7 million last quarter. Day sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 73 days, a decrease from 75 days last quarter.
As of March 31, our inventory level net of reserves was at $340 million compared to $331.7 million in the prior quarter. This amount reflects slightly lower finished good inventories and higher raw material inventory in both our solar and nonsolar businesses as we are working through the component shortages and ramp up our e-Mobility powertrain production line.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter of 2021. We expect revenues for the second quarter to be within the range of $445 million to $465 million. Revenues from the sale of solar products are expected to be within the range of $405 million and $420 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 32% to 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the sale of solar products is expected to be within the range of 36% to 38%.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions."

And one of them may move and actually overcast the others, such as exchange rate, for example, but from a perspective related to the logistic costs, basically our prices are usually prenegotiated in advance. And we try to close them as much as possible in order to hedge prices against changes that are happening, and we were able actually to do it pretty well in the last few quarters. It's simply that over time the costs went up and our prices elapsed, and therefore we had to pay the higher prices. So right now I think that we have a pretty clear visibility for the ocean freight prices, at least for the quarter where we guided. We do not see a lot of changes happening there. I think that, for the quarters to come, we do not have yet numbers to see. We believe that the trend is going to be slightly downwards, but of course, as long as the traffic of boats in and out from the United States and to China and the other areas is somehow disturbed because of COVID and because of changes in the trade patterns, this may change. We do not expect major changes more than we saw this quarter, however, in the next few quarters."

Then our expectation was around $300 million, as we communicated in the past. However, we do see that this assumption that was based on relatively large ASP erosion in the cell industry is not really materializing.

So Europe was an interesting winter in the fact that the first couple of months were pretty tough winter and installation rates were kind of slow. And then sometime from mid-February and on, things opened up and installation rate is gone up. Sell-through is gone up. And most of our dialogues with our distributors across Europe both for residential and commercial are about pull-ins and expedite these days, as the market woke up very aggressively and inventory levels are relatively low, compared to the pull from the installers.
In terms of the general breakdown, if that's what you're referring to. So we are stabilizing more on a 40%, 45% U.S.; 40% roughly Europe; and 15% rest of world. Rest of world is growing quite quickly, and that pattern might shift later on. And we are investing a lot into places like Korea that I mentioned, Taiwan that is a good-growing market. Thailand is a good-growing and interesting market, as well as the other places that we are present already like in a strong way like Australia and Brazil's and even in our home court in Israel. So the growth rate in these regions of the market are higher than that in the U.S. and in Europe, and we are making the investments in order to capitalize, but still nonetheless, for the foreseeable future, that mix of roughly -- or going, depending on the season, between 40% to 50% each between Europe and the U.S., and the rest coming from the rest of the world, is probably going to be the pattern for the next 12 to 18 months continuously."

I will say that, in this quarter, first of all, as I've laid out, if you take the mid-range of our guidance, we are supposed to be at around 37% on the mid-range, which means about 200 basis points of reduction compared to this quarter. This actually encapsulates the vast majority of all of them because the ocean freight is usually, I would say, several -- I would say, not more than 100 to 150 basis points in general usually, but again these kind of expenses almost doubled over the last quarter. But this is something that -- again that is changing based on the routes that you're shipping, whether you ship more from Europe, whether you ship more from China and Vietnam. And there are a lot of fluctuations there, and you see a relatively large number. The exchange rate differences, of course, are hard to predict. This quarter, they were above the usual rate, but at the end they worked a little bit against us.

It's more actually the inventory days that they're holding, and that means for how long they can basically supply based on the inventories that they have. Now in general I can tell you that, first of all, as Zvi mentioned, from a component and from logistic point of view, we did not face any trouble, delivered our products. And therefore, we were not -- we were able to supply whatever demand came. When the vendors are looking at their inventory, each of them make their decisions based on what they see and project. And in general what you see is that, towards the end of the first quarter, the absolute number or the absolute value of inventory is growing in the channels because everyone is getting ready for Q2 and Q3. And also of course, the more you hear about component shortages in the market, the more you hear about complexities of companies to provide [ and at time ], you see those, I would call it, distributors trying to optimize the level of inventory that they're holding, which is something that cost them money in working capital, with the, I would call it, desire to get as much stability by simply holding the inventory.
So in essence what we see right now is that, when we talk to our distributors, we're very well aligned with them on the lead times. As Zvi mentioned, even if there are logistic hurdles, we're able to meet the delivery times. And we're able to communicate them well to the distributors, and we let them to understand and decide what is the level that they have. This also means, by the way, that we don't see a drag of orders coming or pulling forward simply to make sure that we have -- or they have more inventories that -- and something that can affect them later. So it's a kind of a, I would call it, circular process where the joint planning for us and them allows them to plan well the inventory. Our ability to deliver related to all the hurdles and the complexities on time is something that make them comfortable, which in turn allows them to be more precise in the way that they are planning the inventory and the inventory levels. Right now at least, we see normal behavior for this time of the year. And again we do not believe that there is any pull-ins or any deliveries that are done now simply in order to secure that they have inventories for the rest of the year."

And it does leave the opening in -- or leaves labor as -- at least from a balance of systems. And I'm just wondering how you are thinking about the reduction of labor cost as a function of either as you talk about 3-phase sort of light commercial, if you will, in nonutility; or resi side of things. Is that about lightning, reducing the weight of your inverters? Or how are you thinking about that value proposition at this point?"

It is something that we are paying attention to at many levels. And generally, over the years, it was considered a relative strength of ours, our position with the large installation companies. And some of that strength was coming from a lot of joint efforts to help their installation efficiency and our -- the importance we were putting in it and the willingness to discuss these type of items and working together on how we help them in some cases in our small part. Obviously the big issue is theirs in terms of increase the amount of installations that can be done per day or reduce the amount of time per installation. And there are things that have been done over the years in terms of integration of elements that prior used to be installed separately and incorporating them into the inverter and other elements of reducing time of commissioning and downloading software and things like that. So in all of those areas, we are investing a lot of R&D and doing that in cooperation with some of the large customers that we work with both in residential and C&I. There are, as you suggest, also opportunities that are more related to the overall balance of system of installations. And the direction that things are going, more in C&I, we are investing again R&D and looking at these type of opportunities. And it's an area that we have a team that is focused on -- again it's not something to get into right now, but I -- we concur that this is an area of growing importance in terms of the growth of the industry and the adoption of these type of solutions around the world."

Because for the past decade or 2, it's largely been competing against different solar technologies, and today, it's now a competition amongst EV system design or transmission and distribution of nonsolar-based technologies. So as you think through the hierarchy from your system solution perspective and multiple facets to that, how are you thinking about making sure that you have the capacity in a fabless design?"

And it's a trend that we plan to continue and exercise also in some of our other businesses.
So the broader topic of the question is indeed -- and I think it's a good sign for our industry, is the entrance of big technology players that are seeing renewables and solar and PV in particular as growth opportunities and are -- as significant opportunities that are here to stay. So we welcome that, and I think it's good for all of us. I think we are pretty aware of our strengths and at the same time aware of our weaknesses. And now that we are in the e-Mobility space in some of the areas, it also allows us to compare ourselves to other companies from other industries; and realize that, if you take the specific topics of power electronics and high efficiency, high-reliability power electronics and the ability to mass produce high-quality, high-efficient power electronics, that's what we know how to do. That is the core of, the strength of the company. And we feel good about our capability and talent and compared to most companies that we came across. And we came across some of the very well-known names around the world in this area. So that's our strength, and it's a strength that we believe can provide us a lot of opportunities in the future. And we are focusing on maintaining that strength and finding the way to capitalize on it. And I hope that helps answer the question that you were aiming for."

And therefore, there is an expectation that, at least in the short term, gross margin will be there. Now it will not be there maybe much higher at the very beginning due to the fact that you still need to ramp up. There are economies of scale related to the way that you ramp up, but we definitely see a potential to be there. I think the next layer of potential is actually once we have our Sella 2 factory. And this is something that will come at the later part of -- in '22, when batteries from Sella 2 will start arriving, because at that point we will have our own factory with our own costs and with our own supply chain, meaning that we do not need to leave margin maybe with the hands of a third party as well.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. In my remarks today, I'll discuss the trends and momentum in our different business segments, update on new product releases, in particular, the introduction of our residential battery and at the end, discuss how we are navigating the much talked about global supply and logistics challenges. We are happy to report record revenues in both our solar and nonsolar segments for the second quarter of 2021.
Our total revenues this quarter were $480 million, consisting of a record $431 million from our solar business and a record $49 million of revenue from our nonsolar business. Overall, this quarter, we shipped 5 million power optimizers and approximately 180,000 inverters. The record solar revenues reflect strong demand for our solar products across all segments and geographies. In particular, we saw this quarter record revenues in Europe led by record revenues in the Netherlands, Italy and Poland as well as record revenues in what we call rest of the world, representing all regions outside of North America and Europe.
In the U.S. This was the third consecutive quarter of growth in delivery of residential products. In U.S. commercial, revenue grew more than 80% quarter-over-quarter. In addition to the revenue growth, we are seeing consistent increase in sell-through and installation rates of both our residential and commercial products globally. If in recent quarters, we discussed healthy inventories in residential and relatively high inventory levels in commercial. Today, in most channels, inventory levels are below historical normal levels, both in residential and commercial.
On the product side, we continue to see very good acceptance of the energy hub backup ready inverter in the U.S. residential market. And in this quarter, we began shipping the energy hub to Australia. Later in the year, we expect to begin shipping the European version of the energy hub as well. I want to take a couple of minutes to elaborate on the capabilities of the energy hub, which make it so attractive to our customers. As reflected in its name, the energy hub inverter is designed to accommodate and control multiple energy elements of the home. For example, already today, in addition to the battery,  we ship a SolarEdge EV charger as well as an electric water heater controller, all of which are controlled by the energy hub inverters. Homeowners manage all of these functionalities through our recently released, My SolarEdge app that has more than 2 million users to date. Referring specifically to the storage capability, our energy hub inverter is DC-coupled with the battery in a way that maximizes utilization of the energy coming from the solar system. The importance of the additional energy from a DC-coupled system is critical, in particular, during backup scenarios. As we explained in the past, when the grid is down, a DC-coupled system will harvest all of the energy generated by the modules and feed it into the battery even when the power generated by the solar system exceeds the nameplate capacity of the inverter.
As frequencies and duration of outages are becoming more prevalent, the benefit of this architecture is accentuated, and we see more and more homeowners benefiting from the use of this feature. In California alone, in the past 3 months, more than 6,500 homes benefited from 45,000 hours of backup energy provided by their SolarEdge system. On that note, as planned, we initiated shipments of our SolarEdge energy bank residential battery to the United States and Europe. The DC-coupled 10-kilowatt hour battery uses Samsung SDI cells and has been designed based on our knowledge and experience from more than 30,000 SolarEdge installed systems with batteries. The availability of our battery means that our installers and homeowners can enjoy the benefit of high efficiency, easy installation and seamless integration with our energy hub inverter that optimizes self-consumption while connected to the grid and maximizes power during outage events. We are gradually ramping production of the battery and plan to ship between 25 to 30-megawatt hour of batteries in the third quarter.
In order to meet the strong demand, we have signed an agreement with Samsung SDI for the supply of 1-gigawatt hour of cells to be provided in 2022. We are excited about this cooperation with a leading high-quality cell manufacturer. From the second half of 2022, we expect to be shipping batteries based on cells manufactured in our Sella 2 factory in Korea currently under construction. Just as we have our own Sella 1 manufacturing facility for inverters and optimizers, which gives us speed and flexibility for initial volume of new products augmented by high volumes from contract manufacturers, we expect that Sella 2 will give us similar flexibility for cell and battery needs for our various businesses, while cooperating with Tier 1 partners and supplying the high volumes needed to meet demand.
Moving to trends in our C&I business. As anticipated, we are seeing steady growth in cells and installations of our commercial products. This coincides with the release of our new 120-kilowatt synergy inverter that is targeting both rooftop and ground mount installations. We recently began shipping the 120-kilowatt synergy inverter to the U.S., which we believe will give a boost to our recent momentum of penetration to community solar ground mount installation segment where in recent months, we have installed more than 50 megawatts in more than 40 projects. In other regions as well, we are seeing progress in penetrating the market of small-scale utility projects. For example, we have a 35-megawatt project currently being installed in Japan and a 77-megawatt project in Taiwan expected to begin delivery in the third quarter.
Moving to our nonsolar business, where we reported record revenues of $49 million this quarter, primarily driven by the ramp of production of powertrain units and batteries for the Fiat E-Ducato in Europe. We expect these volumes to continue and increase in the coming quarters. Also contributing to the growth in nonsolar revenue this quarter were initial deliveries by Kokam of batteries for the first of 2 utility scale energy storage projects, 1 in Australia.
Moving to the operational side. Like other industries, our industry is also dealing with issues around component shortages, logistic costs and the impact of COVID. As we discussed on last quarter's call, from a component supply point of view, the multi-store strategy we put in place several years ago enables us to meet the current and we believe future growth in demand. At times, this counts at a higher cost due to expedited logistics. A temporary challenge is the COVID outbreak in Vietnam. As of a couple of weeks ago, production in our contract manufacturer's factory in Vietnam is at a reduced level due to a government-mandated lockdown. We are mitigating the short-term challenge by increasing output in our manufacturing facilities in China, Hungary and Israel. This will require some expedited shipments and additional tariffs due to a higher portion of shipments coming from China to the United States. All in all, based on current visibility, thanks to the flexibility that we have built into our operational strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue and meet the growing demand we are experiencing for our products.
And with this, I hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

Total revenues for the second quarter were $480.1 million, an 18% increase compared to $405.5 million last quarter and a 45% increase compared to $331.9 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the solar segment were $431.5 million, a 15% increase compared to $376.4 million last quarter. The quarter's revenue do not include residential battery shipments, which we initiated at the end of the quarter.
U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $175.1 million and represented 40.6% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were a record $200.7 million or 46.5% of our revenues, and the rest of the world solar revenues were a record $55.7 million or 12.9% of our total solar revenues. On a megawatt basis, we shipped 580 megawatts to the United States, 745 megawatts to Europe and 319 megawatts to the rest of the world. 43% of this amount were commercial products, and the remaining 57% were residential.
This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 61.4% of our solar revenues. Two U.S. customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenues. Blended ASP increased by approximately 20.5% compared to the last quarter since the ratio of optimizers to inverters was higher than usual due to temporary manufacturing and logistic optimization. In general, the pricing environment remained stable this quarter, while for the third quarter, we notified our customers of a modest price increase to support increased freight expenses.
This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar segments were a record $48.5 million. This record revenues were led by the e-Mobility division where sales of powertrain systems to Stellantis continue to grow and by increased sales of Kokam's lithium-ion batteries and cells. We expect the nonsolar segment revenues to continue and grow as a proportion of the total revenues in the upcoming quarters.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared to 34.5% in the prior quarter and 31% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 33.9% compared to 36.5% in the prior quarter and 32.4% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the solar segment was 37.4% compared to 39.7% in the prior quarter and above our long-term solar gross margin target of 36% plus/minus 1%.
In comparison to the last quarter, solar segment gross margin was affected by approximately 150 basis points by higher logistic costs resulting from increased freight costs. This quarter, 88% of the products imported to the United States came from nontariff manufacturing sites. Gross margin for our nonsolar segment was positive at 3.3% compared to minus 4.7% in the previous quarter due to increased production level of powertrains from our e-Mobility business, combined with healthy margins from the storage business.
On a non-GAAP basis, Operating expenses for the second quarter were $81.5 million or 17% of revenues compared to $76.2 million or 18.8% of revenues in the prior quarter and $61.1 million or 18.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This increase is mainly a result of increased head count in our R&D and sales departments as well as salary increases that came into effect on April 1. Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 15.8% compared to 17% last quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $81.3 million compared to $71.9 million in the previous quarter and $46.6 million for the same quarter last year. This quarter, the solar segment generated an operating profit of $92.9 million compared to an operating profit of $85.5 million last quarter. This number represents 21.5% of our solar revenues and is in the midpoint of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. The non-solar segment generated an operating loss of $11.6 million, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $13.6 million in the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP financial income for the quarter was $1.7 million compared to a non-GAAP financial expense of $6.3 million in the previous quarter due to the relatively stable foreign currency exchange rates. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.5 million compared to $10.1 million in the previous quarter and $8.1 million for the same period last year.
GAAP net income for the second quarter was $45.1 million compared to a GAAP net income of $30.1 million in the previous quarter and $36.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $72.5 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $55.5 million in the previous quarter. GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.82 for the second quarter compared to $0.55 in the previous quarter and $0.70 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $1.28 compared to $0.98 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the same quarter last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash deposits and investments were $1.1 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $509.3 million. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated $38.7 million in cash from operations and continue to invest in the construction of our Sella 2 cell factory in Korea as well as increased manufacturing capacity with our contract manufacturers. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter to $343.7 million compared to $271.7 million last quarter. Days sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 76 days, an increase from 73 days last quarter, a result of higher revenues generated at the later part of the quarter and an increase in sales to large customers that enjoy more favorable credit terms in the overall mix. As of June 30, our inventory level net of reserves was at $321.9 million compared to $340 million in the prior quarter. Most of this reduction is related to finished good levels in the solar segment, while raw materials decreased to a lower extent in the solar segment and slightly increased in the nonsolar segment, where we continue to ramp up production.
Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter of 2021. We expect revenues for the third quarter of 2021 to be within the range of $520 million to $540 million. Revenues of the solar segment are expected to be within the range of $460 million and $480 million. In the third quarter, we expect to ship 25 to 30-megawatt hour of residential storage systems to the United States and Europe as we continue to ramp the manufacturing of this product. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 32% to 34%. Gross margin of the solar segment is expected to be within the range of 35% to 37%.

The first one is the freight expenses, which stabilized at a higher level. And right now, at least, we do not see a lot of ease in this area, although we do not see, by the way, increasing these costs. But when it comes to the cost themselves, it's also a question of whether we will need to expedite some of the shipments due to the fact that, again, customers will need more goods in order to install. And we will decide to use air shipments instead of ocean freight in order to be their own time. So I think that it's not coming from the price, but actually from our decision about how much to expedite. The second area which will affect, and I think that most of the -- if you take the midpoint now when you compare it to the gross margin level of the second quarter, which is, of course, in obviously, that Q3 is lower A lot of it is also related from the fact that Zvi mentioned when the Vietnam manufacturing facility is working at reduced capacity due to the government enforced lockdowns there we are expanding our manufacturing in China. We're lucky to have manufacturing areas, both in Vietnam, China, Hungary and Israel. And therefore, we can maneuver between them. But when you are manufacturing more in China, that means that you're paying more tariffs when you enter into the United States. And a lot of the decrease that you see in the expectation of gross margin for the next quarter is actually coming from there. It's not necessarily just from the shipment."

So as the answer -- the question follows the previous one, the answer actually follows the previous question as well -- answer as well because our ability to supply is basically dependent on the supply of cells from Samsung in this case and our ability to turn them into cells. What we see this year is that due to some of the logistic challenges we are getting cells a little bit late into the year. And therefore, it's basically dependent on their arrival time and our processing time in order not only to manufacture them, but also to ship them using ocean freight into the U.S. And in Europe, it's a little bit more easier. So here, I'm not sure if you will be able to meet all of this capacity this year. However, whatever capacity we are not going to utilize this year, we're going to basically turn into the next year. So if we're missing something less in Q4, it will simply spill over into Q1. And since the demand at least right now seems to be higher than we can manufacture, I believe that it's just a matter of splitting it between the quarters. One thing to mention, though, of course, is also the fact that when we talk about the next year is that to this supply agreement, we will have our own Sella 2 cells that are supposed to join at the second half of the year. And again, if the demand is there, we will know how to turn those into revenues, which, of course, can get us to a higher number."

So indeed, the change in the ratio is also because of the growth in commercial and growth in large projects in commercial and the availability of higher power inverter, all of which are translating to more optimizers per [indiscernible], which is part of the scalability of a DC architecture like the one that we have. And actually, in some cases, specifically to this quarter because people wanted to be 120-kilowatt the new inverter, and we weren't yet at high volume. They still took the optimizers early so that they begin installing them in the field because that takes a fair amount of time, and it's a task that is usually done first and then the inverters can follow later. So that also contributed to the skewed ratio this quarter compared to previous ones. But overall, as I discussed in the prepared remarks, we are -- the number of large projects that we are involved in is growing nicely and in all geographies, not only in the U.S. and the Europe, where we were traditionally strong in commercial and Australia, of course, but also in Asia Pacific, in places like Taiwan, Thailand, beginning in Korea as well.

I know that has some mixed element attached to it. But given some of the moving parts here with respect to mix and then also the modest price increase you guys have announced here for 3Q. I guess how should we think about volume trends because you've seen sort of flattish volumes on a megawatt basis? Does that sort of revert back to a more normal sequential increase into the third quarter? Or are we going to continue to see sort of more muted volume trends on that megawatt basis, just given the mix issue? I just would love to understand that a little bit better for modeling."

So I'll answer one-by-one, and if I forget anything, please feel free to remind me. So with regards to the cells coming from our supply agreement, actually, all of them are going to go into our residential batteries. That means that, of course, if there is more demand than this amount, we can utilize once the Sella 2 factory starts to work the Kokam cells for this business. And if not, there are other independent businesses that Kokam can do with those cells. But at least the Samsung cells are all designed towards our residential battery and we hope that they will be consumed at these levels because it's a relatively large capacity compared to what comes today to the United States. When it comes to the volumes, actually, again, I think that this quarter, the ASP, as we said and we noted was a little bit, I would say, artificial because when we're calculating the ASP per watt of course, it's based on the nameplate capacity of the inverters. And when we sell more optimizers, the dollars come on the revenue, but the capacity does not go in. And in general, I think that the more commercial you will see, you see more a ratio of optimizers to inverters. We do expect to see volumes growing in both of them. But since you can see that at least in the last 2, 3 quarters, even though we are improving in commercial, the ratio was lower than in the past, then the ratio of higher amount of optimizers to inverters should be maintained in a sense. The one thing to say, though, is that the fact that as Zvi mentioned in the previous answer, since some of this is actually related to new inverters that are now just produced. We do have a little bit of shifting from, let's say, Q3 into Q2 with the amount of optimizers. So it's kind of a temporary jump in the number of optimizers that will go down in Q3. But in general, the more commercial you see and the more improvement you see there, you will see better ratio of -- or higher ratio of optimizers to inverters. And lastly, again, when coming to the price increases, I think that the effect here is, in general, going to be minimal on almost all of the segments due to the fact that they are, first of all, very modest, as we said, low single-digit percentages of increase, and therefore, we do not expect to have major impact on ASP due to these increases.

The ramp-up is supposed to be relatively simple as it's not a very, I would call it, a complicated or capital-intensive investment that is needed by our contract manufacturers. And therefore, the ramp is mostly, I would say, determined by the supply of sales rather than our own ability to process them into batteries. I don't think that it's going to be linear because by definition, the quantities that we still have for this year coming prior to the new agreement that will start in the beginning of 2022 are not even getting closer to the 250-megawatt hour that we will be able to provide next year per quarter. And therefore, I would assume that you should see I would say almost linear increase towards the end of the year from where we started. So that means about 25 to 30-megawatt increase in, let's say, the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit more, again, depends on the amount of sales. And then you will see an acceleration in Q1 that will get us up to 250. I do not expect that this will happen immediately in Q1. So I would say a kind of a linear growth of about 25 to 30 megawatts per quarter in Q3 and Q4 of ramp, then an increase that is steeper in Q1 and then somewhere in Q2 -- middle of Q2 at least, we should be in a sense, stabilizing at 250-megawatt hour per quarter."

So I'll start from the margin, which is the easiest question here. At least in the margin, the main issue here is ramp.  Especially in the e-Mobility area, the fixed assets or the fixed, I would call it, means of manufacturing that we have are putting away on the gross margin. It depends on the amount of vehicles and powertrain units that we are delivering. And we started to really deliver substantial amounts in Q1 then, of course, we grew in Q2, and we expect to see steady growth towards Q3 and Q4. And that means that over this next quarters, this will actually generate a situation where all of these fixed amounts will be spread over a much larger amount of units, of course, improving the margins. In addition to this, we also believe that there is a growth that we see in the lithium-ion business of Kokam that is already characterized with a healthy gross margin. And the combination of one -- the shrinkage of the negative effect of the e-Mobility plus the increase in the battery that is coming with very good margins, at least at this stage, will help us to get to this, I would call it, positive and higher single digit to low double digits of gross margins on all of the nonsolar. As of splitting the business of the e-Mobility, at least today, we're not looking at the short term, I would call it, optimizations just by the way that the capital markets are working. We truly believe that for the long term, and this was the reason that we acquired the e-Mobility division to begin with, is that having a company that is basically specializes in energy -- smart energy management and energy conversion and being able to have a one-stop shop coming from the generation of electricity into the, I would call it, storage of electricity up to the utilization, not just by our e-Mobility business, but also by our critical power businesses that will grow.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call. In my remarks today, I'll discuss the trends and momentum in our different business segments, update on new product releases, in particular, the introduction of our residential battery and at the end, discuss how we are navigating the much talked about global supply and logistics challenges. We are happy to report record revenues in both our solar and nonsolar segments for the second quarter of 2021.
Our total revenues this quarter were $480 million, consisting of a record $431 million from our solar business and a record $49 million of revenue from our nonsolar business. Overall, this quarter, we shipped 5 million power optimizers and approximately 180,000 inverters. The record solar revenues reflect strong demand for our solar products across all segments and geographies. In particular, we saw this quarter record revenues in Europe led by record revenues in the Netherlands, Italy and Poland as well as record revenues in what we call rest of the world, representing all regions outside of North America and Europe.
In the U.S,  this was the third consecutive quarter of growth in delivery of residential products. In U.S. commercial, revenue grew more than 80% quarter-over-quarter. In addition to the revenue growth, we are seeing consistent increase in sell-through and installation rates of both our residential and commercial products globally. If in recent quarters, we discussed healthy inventories in residential and relatively high inventory levels in commercial, today, in most channels, inventory levels are below historical normal levels, both in residential and commercial.
On the product side, we continue to see very good acceptance of the energy hub backup ready inverter in the U.S. residential market. And in this quarter, we began shipping the energy hub to Australia. Later in the year, we expect to begin shipping the European version of the energy hub as well. I want to take a couple of minutes to elaborate on the capabilities of the energy hub, which make it so attractive to our customers. As reflected in its name, the energy hub inverter is designed to accommodate and control multiple energy elements of the home. For example, already today, in addition to the battery,  we ship a SolarEdge EV charger as well as an electric water heater controller, all of which are controlled by the energy hub inverters. Homeowners manage all of these functionalities through our recently released, My SolarEdge app that has more than 2 million users to date. Referring specifically to the storage capability, our energy hub inverter is DC-coupled with the battery in a way that maximizes utilization of the energy coming from the solar system. The importance of the additional energy from a DC-coupled system is critical, in particular, during backup scenarios. As we explained in the past, when the grid is down, a DC-coupled system will harvest all of the energy generated by the modules and feed it into the battery even when the power generated by the solar system exceeds the nameplate capacity of the inverter.
As frequencies and duration of outages are becoming more prevalent, the benefit of this architecture is accentuated, and we see more and more homeowners benefiting from the use of this feature. In California alone, in the past 3 months, more than 6,500 homes benefited from 45,000 hours of backup energy provided by their SolarEdge system. On that note, as planned, we initiated shipments of our SolarEdge energy bank residential battery to the United States and Europe. The DC-coupled 10-kilowatt hour battery uses Samsung SDI cells and has been designed based on our knowledge and experience from more than 30,000 SolarEdge installed systems with batteries. The availability of our battery means that our installers and homeowners can enjoy the benefit of high efficiency, easy installation and seamless integration with our energy hub inverter that optimizes self-consumption while connected to the grid and maximizes power during outage events. We are gradually ramping production of the battery and plan to ship between 25- to 30-megawatt hour of batteries in the third quarter.
In order to meet the strong demand, we have signed an agreement with Samsung SDI for the supply of 1-gigawatt hour of cells to be provided in 2022. We are excited about this cooperation with a leading high-quality cell manufacturer. From the second half of 2022, we expect to be shipping batteries based on cells manufactured in our Sella 2 factory in Korea currently under construction. Just as we have our own Sella 1 manufacturing facility for inverters and optimizers, which gives us speed and flexibility for initial volume of new products augmented by high volumes from contract manufacturers, we expect that Sella 2 will give us similar flexibility for cell and battery needs for our various businesses, while cooperating with Tier 1 partners and supplying the high volumes needed to meet demand.
Moving to trends in our C&I business. As anticipated, we are seeing steady growth in cells and installations of our commercial products. This coincides with the release of our new 120-kilowatt synergy inverter that is targeting both rooftop and ground mount installations. We recently began shipping the 120-kilowatt synergy inverter to the U.S., which we believe will give a boost to our recent momentum of penetration to community solar ground mount installation segment where in recent months, we have installed more than 50 megawatts in more than 40 projects. In other regions as well, we are seeing progress in penetrating the market of small-scale utility projects. For example, we have a 35-megawatt project currently being installed in Japan and a 77-megawatt project in Taiwan expected to begin delivery in the third quarter.
Moving to our nonsolar business, where we reported record revenues of $49 million this quarter, primarily driven by the ramp of production of powertrain units and batteries for the Fiat E-Ducato in Europe. We expect these volumes to continue and increase in the coming quarters. Also contributing to the growth in nonsolar revenue this quarter were initial deliveries by Kokam of batteries for the first of 2 utility scale energy storage projects, 1 in Australia.
Moving to the operational side. Like other industries, our industry is also dealing with issues around component shortages, logistic costs and the impact of COVID. As we discussed on last quarter's call, from a component supply point of view, the multi-store strategy we put in place several years ago enables us to meet the current and we believe future growth in demand. At times, this comes at a higher cost due to expedited logistics. A temporary challenge is the COVID outbreak in Vietnam. As of a couple of weeks ago, production in our contract manufacturer's factory in Vietnam is at a reduced level due to a government-mandated lockdown. We are mitigating the short-term challenge by increasing output in our manufacturing facilities in China, Hungary and Israel. This will require some expedited shipments and additional tariffs due to a higher portion of shipments coming from China to the United States. All in all, based on current visibility, thanks to the flexibility that we have built into our operational strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue and meet the growing demand we are experiencing for our products.
And with this, I hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results."

Total revenues for the second quarter were $480.1 million, an 18% increase compared to $405.5 million last quarter and a 45% increase compared to $331.9 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the solar segment were $431.5 million, a 15% increase compared to $376.4 million last quarter. The quarter's revenue do not include residential battery shipments, which we initiated at the end of the quarter.
U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $175.1 million and represented 40.6% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were a record $200.7 million or 46.5% of our revenues, and the rest of the world solar revenues were a record $55.7 million or 12.9% of our total solar revenues. On a megawatt basis, we shipped 580 megawatts to the United States, 745 megawatts to Europe and 319 megawatts to the rest of the world. 43% of this amount were commercial products, and the remaining 57% were residential.
This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 61.4% of our solar revenues. Two U.S. customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenues. Blended ASP increased by approximately 20.5% compared to the last quarter since the ratio of optimizers to inverters was higher than usual due to temporary manufacturing and logistic optimization. In general, the pricing environment remained stable this quarter, while for the third quarter, we notified our customers of a modest price increase to support increased freight expenses.
This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar segments were a record $48.5 million. This record revenues were led by the e-Mobility division where sales of powertrain systems to Stellantis continue to grow and by increased sales of Kokam's lithium-ion batteries and cells. We expect the nonsolar segment revenues to continue and grow as a proportion of the total revenues in the upcoming quarters.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared to 34.5% in the prior quarter and 31% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 33.9% compared to 36.5% in the prior quarter and 32.4% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the solar segment was 37.4% compared to 39.7% in the prior quarter and above our long-term solar gross margin target of 36% plus/minus 1%.
In comparison to the last quarter, solar segment gross margin was affected by approximately 150 basis points by higher logistic costs resulting from increased freight costs. This quarter, 88% of the products imported to the United States came from nontariff manufacturing sites. Gross margin for our nonsolar segment was positive at 3.3% compared to minus 4.7% in the previous quarter due to increased production level of powertrains from our e-Mobility business, combined with healthy margins from the storage business.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the second quarter were $81.5 million or 17% of revenues compared to $76.2 million or 18.8% of revenues in the prior quarter and $61.1 million or 18.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This increase is mainly a result of increased head count in our R&D and sales departments as well as salary increases that came into effect on April 1. Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 15.8% compared to 17% last quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $81.3 million compared to $71.9 million in the previous quarter and $46.6 million for the same quarter last year. This quarter, the solar segment generated an operating profit of $92.9 million compared to an operating profit of $85.5 million last quarter. This number represents 21.5% of our solar revenues and is in the midpoint of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. The non-solar segment generated an operating loss of $11.6 million, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $13.6 million in the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP financial income for the quarter was $1.7 million compared to a non-GAAP financial expense of $6.3 million in the previous quarter due to the relatively stable foreign currency exchange rates. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.5 million compared to $10.1 million in the previous quarter and $8.1 million for the same period last year.
GAAP net income for the second quarter was $45.1 million compared to a GAAP net income of $30.1 million in the previous quarter and $36.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $72.5 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $55.5 million in the previous quarter. GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.82 for the second quarter compared to $0.55 in the previous quarter and $0.70 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $1.28 compared to $0.98 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the same quarter last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash deposits and investments were $1.1 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $509.3 million. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated $38.7 million in cash from operations and continue to invest in the construction of our Sella 2 cell factory in Korea as well as increased manufacturing capacity with our contract manufacturers. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter to $343.7 million compared to $271.7 million last quarter. Days sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 76 days, an increase from 73 days last quarter, a result of higher revenues generated at the later part of the quarter and an increase in sales to large customers that enjoy more favorable credit terms in the overall mix. As of June 30, our inventory level net of reserves was at $321.9 million compared to $340 million in the prior quarter. Most of this reduction is related to finished good levels in the solar segment, while raw materials decreased to a lower extent in the solar segment and slightly increased in the nonsolar segment, where we continue to ramp up production.
Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter of 2021. We expect revenues for the third quarter of 2021 to be within the range of $520 million to $540 million. Revenues of the solar segment are expected to be within the range of $460 million and $480 million. In the third quarter, we expect to ship 25 to 30-megawatt hour of residential storage systems to the United States and Europe as we continue to ramp the manufacturing of this product. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 32% to 34%. Gross margin of the solar segment is expected to be within the range of 35% to 37%.

The first one is the freight expenses, which stabilized at a higher level. And right now, at least, we do not see a lot of ease in this area, although we do not see, by the way, increasing these costs. But when it comes to the cost themselves, it's also a question of whether we will need to expedite some of the shipments due to the fact that, again, customers will need more goods in order to install. And we will decide to use air shipments instead of ocean freight in order to be there on time. So I think that it's not coming from the price, but actually from our decision about how much to expedite. The second area which will affect, and I think that most of the -- if you take the midpoint now when you compare it to the gross margin level of the second quarter, which is, of course, obviously, that Q3 is lower. A lot of it is also related from the fact that Zvi mentioned when the Vietnam manufacturing facility is working at reduced capacity due to the government enforced lockdowns there, we are expanding our manufacturing in China. We're lucky to have manufacturing areas, both in Vietnam, China, Hungary and Israel. And therefore, we can maneuver between them. But when you are manufacturing more in China, that means that you're paying more tariffs when you enter into the United States. And a lot of the decrease that you see in the expectation of gross margin for the next quarter is actually coming from there. It's not necessarily just from the shipment."

So as the answer -- the question follows the previous one, the answer actually follows the previous question as well -- answer as well because our ability to supply is basically dependent on the supply of cells from Samsung in this case and our ability to turn them into cells. What we see this year is that, due to some of the logistic challenges, we are getting cells a little bit late into the year. And therefore, it's basically dependent on their arrival time and our processing time in order not only to manufacture them, but also to ship them using ocean freight into the U.S. And in Europe, it's a little bit more easier. So here, I'm not sure if we will be able to meet all of this capacity this year. However, whatever capacity we are not going to utilize this year, we're going to basically turn into the next year. So if we're missing something less in Q4, it will simply spill over into Q1. And since the demand, at least right now, seems to be higher than we can manufacture, I believe that it's just a matter of splitting it between the quarters. One thing to mention, though, of course, is also the fact that when we talk about the next year is that to this supply agreement, we will have our own Sella 2 cells that are supposed to join at the second half of the year. And again, if the demand is there, we will know how to turn those into revenues, which, of course, can get us to a higher number."

So indeed, the change in the ratio is also because of the growth in commercial and growth in large projects in commercial and the availability of higher power inverter, all of which are translating to more optimizers per inverter, which is part of the scalability of a DC architecture like the one that we have. And actually, in some cases, specifically to this quarter because people wanted to the 120-kilowatt, the new inverter, and we weren't yet at high volume, they still took the optimizers early so that they'd begin installing them in the field because that takes a fair amount of time, and it's a task that is usually done first and then the inverters can follow later. So that also contributed to the skewed ratio this quarter compared to previous ones. But overall, as I discussed in the prepared remarks, we are -- the number of large projects that we are involved in is growing nicely and in all geographies, not only in the U.S. and the Europe, where we were traditionally strong in commercial and Australia, of course, but also in Asia Pacific, in places like Taiwan, Thailand, beginning in Korea as well.

I know that has some mix element attached to it. But given some of the moving parts here with respect to mix and then also the modest price increase you guys have announced here for 3Q, I guess how should we think about volume trends because you've seen sort of flattish volumes on a megawatt basis? Does that sort of revert back to a more normal sequential increase into the third quarter? Or are we going to continue to see sort of more muted volume trends on that megawatt basis, just given the mix issue? I just would love to understand that a little bit better for modeling."

So I'll answer one-by-one, and if I forget anything, please feel free to remind me. So with regards to the cells coming from our supply agreement, actually, all of them are going to go into our residential batteries. That means that, of course, if there is more demand than this amount, we can utilize once the Sella 2 factory starts to work, the Kokam cells for this business. And if not, there are other independent businesses that Kokam can do with those cells. But at least the Samsung cells are all designed towards our residential battery and we hope that they will be consumed at these levels because it's a relatively large capacity compared to what comes today to the United States. When it comes to the volumes, actually, again, I think that this quarter, the ASP, as we said and we noted was a little bit, I would say, artificial because when we're calculating the ASP per watt of course, it's based on the nameplate capacity of the inverters. And when we sell more optimizers, the dollars come on the revenue, but the capacity does not go in. And in general, I think that the more commercial you will see, you see more a ratio of optimizers to inverters. We do expect to see volumes growing in both of them. But since you can see that at least in the last 2, 3 quarters, even though we are improving in commercial, the ratio was lower than in the past, then the ratio of higher amount of optimizers to inverters should be maintained in a sense. The one thing to say, though, is that the fact that as Zvi mentioned in the previous answer, since some of this is actually related to new inverters that are now just produced, we do have a little bit of shifting from, let's say, Q3 into Q2 with the amount of optimizers. So it's kind of a temporary jump in the number of optimizers that will go down in Q3. But in general, the more commercial you see and the more improvement you see there, you will see better ratio of -- or higher ratio of optimizers to inverters. And lastly, again, when coming to the price increases, I think that the effect here is, in general, going to be minimal on almost all of the segments due to the fact that they are, first of all, very modest, as we said, low single-digit percentages of increase, and therefore, we do not expect to have major impact on ASP due to these increases.

This is in addition to the cells that will begin to come out of our factory in the second half of the year. And as I explained, as we do also in our inverter business,  we have our own factory that is a very good mechanism to accelerate initial production of new technologies. And we use lithium-ion batteries in multiple segments and businesses. So we expect that Sella 2 will provide us both capacity of cells to meet additional demand on top of the contract that we signed and also the ability to introduce new products and manufacture the initial volume of those new products. So these are 2 separate sources of cells that are going into similar products in order to give us the flexibility to meet demand and develop new products rapidly."

And therefore, the ramp is mostly, I would say, determined by the supply of sales rather than our own ability to process them into batteries. I don't think that it's going to be linear because by definition, the quantities that we still have for this year coming prior to the new agreement that will start in the beginning of 2022 are not even getting closer to the 250-megawatt hour that we will be able to provide next year per quarter. And therefore, I would assume that you should see, I would say, almost linear increase towards the end of the year from where we started. So that means about 25- to 30-megawatt increase in, let's say, the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit more, again, depends on the amount of sales. And then you will see an acceleration in Q1 that will get us up to 250. I do not expect that this will happen immediately in Q1. So I would say a kind of a linear growth of about 25- to 30-megawatts per quarter in Q3 and Q4 of ramp, then an increase that is steeper in Q1 and then somewhere in Q2 -- middle of Q2 at least, we should be in a sense, stabilizing at 250-megawatt hour per quarter."

So I'll start from the margin, which is the easiest question here. At least in the margin, the main issue here is ramp.  Especially in the e-Mobility area, the fixed assets or the fixed, I would call it, means of manufacturing that we have are putting weight on the gross margin. It depends on the amount of vehicles and powertrain units that we are delivering. And we started to really deliver substantial amounts in Q1 then, of course, we grew in Q2, and we expect to see steady growth towards Q3 and Q4. And that means that over these next quarters, this will actually generate a situation where all of these fixed amounts will be spread over a much larger amount of units, of course, improving the margins. In addition to this, we also believe that there is a growth that we see in the lithium-ion business of Kokam that is already characterized with a healthy gross margin. And the combination of one -- the shrinkage of the negative effect of the e-Mobility plus the increase in the battery that is coming with very good margins, at least at this stage, will help us to get to this, I would call it, positive and higher single digit to low double digits of gross margins on all of the nonsolar. As of splitting the business of the e-Mobility, at least today, we're not looking at the short term, I would call it, optimizations just by the way that the capital markets are working. We truly believe that for the long term, and this was the reason that we acquired the e-Mobility division to begin with, is that having a company that is -- basically specializes in energy -- smart energy management and energy conversion and being able to have a one-stop shop coming from the generation of electricity into the, I would call it, storage of electricity up to the utilization, not just by our e-Mobility business, but also by our critical power businesses that will grow.

We are happy to be announcing a record revenue quarter of $526 million. We are seeing growing demand for our exist products across all segments and regions and strong interest in our pipeline of new products. In fact, we have already secured orders for delivery in Q4 and in Q1 of more than 4 gigawatts of AC nameplate inverters compared to 1.9 gigawatts that we shipped in this quarter, and we are still receiving additional orders for this period. 
In today's call, I will address the temporary headwinds that we are facing on the operational side, which will clarify our next quarter guidance which does not fully reflect the high demand for our products and our anticipated continued growth. In the last earnings release, we updated the production in our factory in Vietnam have been partially suspended due to a government in-force COVID-related lockdown. We explained that assuming the interruption would be short as we were expecting at the time, we would compensate for it by increasing capacity in our other factories, and this is indeed what we did. However, the shutdown ended up being longer and more extensive than expected, practically putting to halt our manufacturing capacity in Vietnam for 12 weeks. Prior to this event, the Vietnam factory was providing between 20% and 25% of our capacity and the vast majority of our nontariff shipments to the U.S. market. So while we increased capacity in the other sites to partially compensate for it, this shutdown created a gap in supply of products for the fourth quarter that will take some time to replenish and which will come at a higher cost due to the need for expedited shipments and due to tariffs from shipping more China-made products to the U.S. We are, therefore, guiding moderate revenue growth for the fourth quarter at a reduced gross margin. 
The production in the Vietnam factory resumed October 1 and is gradually ramping back to full capacity, which is expected in mid-November. Unrelated to these events in Vietnam, we have been working for some time to build redundancy and expand our manufacturing footprint with a new contract manufacturing site in Mexico. We expect first products to ship from the facility in the first half of 2022. And once ramped, this site will significantly increase our capacity and give us further flexibility to manage growing demand from the U.S. market. 
As is indicated in our record revenue results in the third quarter, we experienced healthy demand for our products and ended the quarter with record backlog. While this is not a data point we usually provide and do not plan to do in the future, it is reflective of the commitments of our customers and their strong demand for our products. To that end, other than in some unique cases of extreme logistical costs, where we will share some of those costs with our customers,  on order level, we do not currently plan to increase prices on deliveries this year. Our customers have trusted us with their early orders, and we value their loyalty. To sum up this topic, we are happy with the record third quarter results and are focused on quickly closing the capacity gap created from the temporary factory closure in Vietnam, while ensuring we are meeting the needs of our customers. 
I'd like to share now some new product news, which is a big part of the demand increase we are seeing. The first is our Energy Bank residential battery. Production of the batteries is ramping at a good pace, and we have installations already in the U.S., Italy, Germany, England, Belgium and first deliveries in Australia. This quarter, we manufactured and shipped approximately 20-megawatt hour of Energy Bank batteries, a bit below what we had anticipated. In Q4, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour compensating for the delays from this quarter. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, we expect to reach production output of 300 Energy Bank batteries per day or 180-megawatt hours per quarter. 
In parallel to ramping battery shipments, we continue to see strong demand for our Energy Hub inverter, where shipments were up from 21,000 units in the second quarter to 37,000 units in the third quarter. We also began shipments of the high-power version of the Energy Hub inverter with up to 11.4 kilowatt AC nameplate capacity and industry-leading 10.3 kilowatt continuous backup power per inverter. Considering the current trends of increased electrification and needs for resilience, we expect average system size and the required power consumption in case of backup to increase as well, and as such, increased adoption of this configuration due to its capacity and power level. The availability of this inverter will also provide cost savings for our customers who until today in many cases, have used multiple inverters to achieve these capacities and power levels. 
As battery attach rates and the interest in resilience intensifies, we are seeing strong interest globally in the combined Energy Hub, Energy Bank solution, which offers a DC-coupled system that harvest more of the energy generated by the modules and feed it into the battery, even when the power generated by the solar system exceeds the nameplate capacity of the inverter. An additional milestone on the product front is that we began installations in Japan of our JET certified HD Wave inverter, which through a built-in AC socket enables direct power consumption from solar in tiff power outage. This is a significant step for SolarEdge towards opening the large residential market in Japan where this capability is mandated by regulation. 
Shifting to our offering of optimizers. In the third quarter, we began shipments in some regions of our fourth generation optimizer that among other improvements, enables high efficiency optimization of newer generation solar modules with higher electrical currents. Additionally, this new optimizer is designed to incorporate the new safety mechanism. In some cases, electrical arcs and safety events are caused by loose connectors or damage caused to cabling from rodents or other various causes. In the new optimizer, we have incorporated a capability that actively measures the temperature at the connectors to detect excessive heat even before it turns into electrical arc. 
This past quarter, we shipped more than 200,000 of these F-Series Generation 4 optimizers, and we will continue to ramp in the coming quarters. 
On the commercial side, we continue to see increased activity driven, among other reasons, by corporations looking to reduce their carbon footprint via solar installations on their facilities. Many of these corporations choose the SolarEdge solution due to our safety and monitoring capabilities. In many cases, we are leveraging success at 1 site for global proliferation to other sites of these international corporations. 
On the smaller utility side, this quarter, we installed our first ground mount installation of our new 330-kilowatt inverter. This 1 megawatt installation has 3 inverters and thousands of optimizers. These new 1.3 kilowatt optimizers are specially designed for this inverter from a performance and cost point of view, and to fit the solar modules typically used in ground mount installation that are typically high power, and in many cases, bifacial. The experience from this installation will assist us as we ramp reduction in sales of this offering in 2022. 
Turning to our nonsolar business, where we had a record quarter in revenues driven from our nonsolar storage business. This is despite the lower-than-planned shipments in the e-mobility business due to instability in the automotive industry. While our ability to deliver has ramped on schedule, considering the current trends in the automotive industry, we expect to end up delivering approximately $70 million from the e-Mobility business for 2021. I I will now hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results. Ronen?"

Segment profit is comprised of gross profit of the segment less operating expenses that do not include amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses and certain other items. Total revenues for the third quarter were a record $526.4 million, a 10% increase compared to $480.1 million last quarter and a 56% increase compared to $338.1 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the solar segment were a record $476.8 million, an 11% increase compared to $431.4 million last quarter and a 53% increase compared to $312.5 million for the same quarter last year. Overall, this quarter, we shipped approximately 4.7 million power optimizers and approximately 231,000 inverters. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $188.6 million and represented 39.5% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were a record $234.5 million or 49.2% of our solar revenues. The revenues in Europe were driven by record results in Germany and Italy which grew over 50% quarter-over-quarter as well as record revenues in Poland and France. Rest of the world solar revenues were $53.7 million or 11.3% of our total solar revenues. The revenues in rest of the world were led by sales in Australia, Japan and Israel and record quarter in Taiwan and Thailand. 
On a megawatt basis, we shipped 592 megawatts to the United States, 1,029 megawatts to Europe and 282 megawatts to the rest of the world. 39% of this amount was commercial products and the remaining 61% were residential. As [indiscernible] watt, excluding battery revenues this quarter was $0.255, a 5.2% decrease from $0.269 last quarter, resulting from a lower portion of U.S. shipments and customer mix as well as higher proportion of inverters in our overall mix. This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 63.8% of our solar revenues. 2 U.S. customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenues each. This quarter,  revenues from our nonsolar business were a record $49.5 million, led by record sales of lithium-ion batteries from our nonsolar storage business. 
GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 32.5% in the prior quarter and 32% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 34% compared to 33.9% in the prior quarter and 33.5% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the solar segment was 36.6% compared to 37.4% in the prior quarter. As detailed by the solar segment gross margin was negatively impacted by measures taken to compensate for our temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Vietnam. This shutdown, which was compensated by more deliveries from our China factory, reduced our nontariff shipments to a 53% of the products sent to the United States this quarter compared to 88% in the second quarter. In total, the additional logistic costs and tariffs, together with some component and raw material price increases added 110 basis points compared to our previous quarter. Our accrual for future warranty claims also rose this quarter, partially because of the increase in product costs and partially due to the increase in our overall installed base. We expect this phenomenon to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for our nonsolar segment was 8.7% compared to 3.3% in the previous quarter due to healthy margins from the storage business and continued improvement of margins in the e-Mobility business. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the third quarter were $83.8 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $81.5 million or 17% of revenues in the prior quarter and $63.2 million or 18.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This growth year-over-year reflects continued investment in our expansion of our R&D and sales capabilities. 
Our solar segment operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 14.6% compared to 15.8% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was -- for the quarter was a record $95.2 million compared to $81.3 million in the previous quarter and $50 million for the same period last year. This quarter, solar segment generated a record operating profit of $104.9 million compared to an operating profit of $92.9 million last quarter. This number represents 22% of our solar revenues and is above the midpoint of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. The nonsolar segment generated an operating loss of $9.7 million, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $11.6 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP financial expenses for the quarter was $3 million compared to non-GAAP financial income of $1.7 million in the previous quarter. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $10.5 million in the previous quarter and $1.6 million for the same period last year. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $53 million compared to a GAAP net income of $45.1 million in the previous quarter and $43.8 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $82.1 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $72.5 million in the previous quarter and $65.9 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.96 for the third quarter compared to $0.82 in the previous quarter and $0.83 in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $1.45 compared to $1.28 in the previous quarter and $1.21 in the same quarter last year. 
Turning now to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $524.1 million. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated $61.8 million of cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter to $416.2 million compared to $343.7 million last quarter. Day sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 90 days, an increase from 76 days last quarter, a result of higher revenues generated in the later part of the quarter and an increase in sales to large customers that enjoy more favorable credit terms in the overall mix. As of September 30, 2021, we our inventory level net of reserves was at $304.7 million compared to $321.9 million in the prior quarter. Most of this reduction is related to lower level of finished goods in the solar segment, while raw material level increased in the solar segment to support manufacturing amidst the global component shortages and slightly decreased in the nonsolar segment. 
Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. As explained throughout this call, due to the shutdown of our factory in Vietnam in the third quarter and its gradual return to normal operations and in light of the strong demand, our fourth quarter guidance is for moderate growth at temporary reduced gross margin. As such, for the fourth quarter of 2021, we are guiding revenues to be within the range of $530 million to $560 million. Revenues from the solar segment are expected to be within the range of $490 million and $515 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour of residential storage systems to the United States and Europe as we continue to ramp the manufacturing of this product. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 30% to 32%. Gross margin for the solar segment is expected to be within the range of 31% to 34%. 
Before opening the line for questions, I would like to update that we are planning for an Analyst Day to be held towards the end of the first quarter of 2022. We will, of course, announce the specific date closer to this time. Operator, we can now take questions, please."

And then in terms of sort of lead times you're quoting on that backlog mix, just to get a sense of how far that stretches out. And it sounds to me like you're saying that because of the backlog and because of the supply chain and manufacturing issues, Q1 should be seasonally much better, maybe better than the modest growth we're seeing here just for Q4, but can you kind of maybe encompass all of that in the context of your backlog trends you're seeing and how it impacts into Q1?

So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- our orders for  shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts.

So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- our orders for  shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts. And in the third quarter, which was a record quarter, we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of inverters. And we're using here inverters as the reference point. It's not a matter of -- it doesn't include batteries and it's not including the optimizers, it's just the way to compare. So the record Q3 was 1.9. And today, we are with backlog for deliveries in the next 2 quarters of more than 4 gigawatts. To the second part of of the question. So indeed, the -- or let me touch on lead times, and I mentioned this as well. So as you know, we have a very wide variety of products and offering and the lead times vary by product. We're still taking -- we're taking few orders for delivery in Q4, unless it's some specific products where we have access and availability and -- but we are still taking orders in Q1. So for most of the products, the lead times are in the range of 12 to 14 weeks. On some commercial products, it's a bit longer than that. And on the batteries, it's a bit longer than that as well. So it's anything that ranges from call it, 12 weeks to 16, 18 weeks on batteries. And the outlook for Q1 is obviously complex, and there are many, many moving parts and unknowns. But generally speaking, with our plans for recovering production capacity in Vietnam as well as from the other factories, we do expect to see growth, in particular, on the top line. From a margin perspective, Q1 will still be challenging in getting that equipment quickly and on time to the customers when and where they need it. So we expect still some margin headwinds in Q1."

So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when you're manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call. The first t",949,"Sure, Brian. So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when you're manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call. The first thing that we did was actually to divert a lot of our manufacturing to China. And this is something that creates first 2 issues. The first 1 is that you need to start now rotating some of the components that were shipped to Vietnam into China in order to make sure that you have the right components at the right place. And of course, we remember that this is all happening while there are component challenges worldwide. And therefore, this by itself creates expenses related to simply mobilizing quickly large amount of components from 1 site to the other, usually on expedited shipment. The second part of this diversion, I would call, is the fact that while you're expediting some of the shipments, the cost of these expedited shipments also increased dramatically over the last few months as we know from what we see all over the world. And therefore, you get like a double effect that even to be able to compensate for the manufacturing in cell itself, you need to pay much more to bring components in. Now we go into the manufacturing. And the idea is that in a normal way of operation, you would usually use your capacity to ship as much as you can using ocean freight to accumulate products close to your customers in our warehouses in Europe and the United States and then ship them locally, all using regular ocean freight and in some cases, of course, ground transportation. Once this capacity is gone, you basically live from the head to -- from your hand to the mouth in a sense. Meaning that wherever you are manufacturing in China, in Israel and in Hungary, you're trying to push as quickly as possible to your customers because they count on you and they know that they need to get products in order to install them. And the only way to do it is simply by sending expedited shipments. And again, expedited shipments more than quadripled and sometimes even 6x more expensive today than they were a few quarters ago. And then you see a double effect of these expedited shipments. And the last thing, of course, is the tariffs on Chinese products. And as I said in my part of the transcript is that our nontariff shipments to the U.S. went down to 53% from 88% last quarter. So in Q3, the effect of all of this was relatively marginal because on one hand, we still had inventories that were on more regular shipments coming that were manufactured in Q2 and came to Europe and the United States in the regular way. And we did observe some of the costs of shipping the components from running location to the other. And you see it in this 110 basis points increase that are also including a little bit of tariffs that were paid when we enter this Chinese product to the United States. But actually, some of these costs are actually capitalized on a product that we brought in Q3, and we're going to sell in Q4. And this is the 110%. If we look now into Q4, what we're going to see is that we'll see approximately 300 to 350 basis points coming from the accumulation of the effect. And that means that now we're not just shipping components that are maybe smaller and in lower volumes from -- in an expedited way from 1 factory to the other. We actually start shipping large product by air or by expedited shipments to their final destination. And at this point, we do not have any more products coming to the U.S. from our Vietnam facilities from the last quarter, simply because this factory was practically down. And those manufacturing that we're doing in Vietnam are not yet coming to the U.S. and allowing us to enjoy the nontariff regions. So in general, what we see is that in Q4, we're basically getting or absorbed most of the hit from the lack of manufacturing in Vietnam and of course, the expedited shipment that is created from this. When it is going to clear? In Q1, first of all, we expect Vietnam sometimes in November, as we said, to go back to normal levels. And therefore, some of the goods will still be sent in an expedited manner to customers to meet Q4 demand, but some of it will be shipped -- Q4 and then some of it will be shipped for Q1 in order to make sure that we have enough inventories to begin the quarter. At the same time, also, again, the manufacturing in China that is now regulated will start to go in a less expedited manner. And therefore, in Q1, we will still see some effect that are residual from Q4, but you'll start to see improvement. And towards Q2 where, hopefully, unless there are more COVID waves, we will see continued manufacturing in all of our factories that have excess capacity above this demand, we will be able to come back to this, I would call it, normal shipment methodology or a system of ocean freight. So it's a little bit of a lengthy explanation, but the idea is that lack of manufacturing in Q4 -- Q3 is becoming more expensive in [indiscernible] in Q4. The improvement in Q4 is contributing to improved margins in Q1 and in Q2, hopefully, we're supposed to be back to the normal margins"

I think that once we're starting to manufacture in Mexico, and at the same time, ocean freight is going back to normal, I would assume that the difference is, of course, better in manufacturing in Mexico, but not as dramatic. But I think that there's another thing that needs to be taken into account. And this is also related to inventory levels and the capital -- uses of capital because the line today from Vietnam to the United States is approximately 6 weeks where products are on a ship before they are being distributed. And once you're manufacturing in Mexico, we're talking about 1 week to 10 days at most. And that means that we can also make our inventory management more efficient. So -- and of course, this is something that also save costs. So I think it's going to be cheaper. It's a little bit hard to evaluate it right now."

There may be an opportunity for larger margins or higher margins in the first few quarters, but we do expect that they will go down a little bit. And of course, the first battery is based on our Samsung cells, and once we're moving to our Sella 2 cells coming by the end of next year, then, of course, we have another chance of expanding them. But in any case, I would say that they would range between 25% to 30%, they will not exceed this number dramatically. And I missed the second part of the question?"

So we are managing through this complex environment, and there's a lot of juggling going on, and R&D resources that are working on qualifying alternative sources in order to make sure that we are never short on what we really need in order to deliver. And it's especially challenging when you're growing, and you're growing in 2 accesses. You're also growing in the volume of the existing products. and also trying to release high volumes of new products because the kind of practice in the components business is that they allocate for you something that you received the prior year, maybe with a slight increase, and they expect you to be happy with that. And but if your business is actually growing dramatically as it is, in our case, it becomes more complex. So the situation is is challenging. But again, we're managing through it. In terms of a sense as to when there is a dramatic improvement, I don't know that we have information that someone else doesn't have. So there are a couple of our suppliers that we really depend on, that we do have some visibility in terms of new capacity that they are bringing online and when that will happen and how we secure access for ourselves into that capacity. But that helps us on some very specific critical items, but the challenge is much broader than that.

So the practice that in recent -- in the last year has become a regulatory mandate in Japan to have with every installation or with every inverter, what they call a utility outlet or a small AC socket that you can pull power from if there's an outage without in the local storage. So we developed that technology for the stake of the Japanese market. The Japanese residential market is a very interesting market and it's -- and on one hand, you have to be patient when trying to take market share in Japan. And at the same time, some of the benefit that our system provides like enhanced safety monitoring capability, the ability to fit a complex roost, all of those are very relevant for the Japanese residential market. So we're we're optimistic about the potential within this residential market, and that's why we developed the technology, and we are productizing it for Japan. It could be product types for other markets, but I think if you look at the global market, there are 2 overriding trends that are impacting the topic of storage. It's the increase of electrification of -- in the homes. So whether it's through shifting to EV or electrifying HVAC, the capacity and power requirements of the home are increasing. And at the same time, grid instability is causing the need and drive towards resilience. So the real solution for what the North American market or European market in terms of resilience, is what we are seeing. People are going to more batteries, larger batteries, larger inverters and larger systems and more attach rates of batteries. That's what we are aiming our offerings in those markets and are optimizing for that capability. That said, we could productize this technology that we have for other markets as well. We'll kind of look and see if that is justified."

Once we will go into Sella 2, then, of course, the 2 gigawatt hour capacity that we have and can be expanded is something that will allow Kokam to grow much further. And in the nonsolar storage business that we see in front of us, either as providing batteries for UPS, for special vehicles, high-power applications and ESS like spinning reserves, I think that there are a lot of opportunities there. But all of those will be, I believe, mostly generated once you'll have Sella 2. And even within this, we need to start producing sales from this product -- this factory send them to customers to be qualified, and then you'll see an accelerated growth coming after, I believe, 2022 into 2023 and more.

And there are the classical or the long-term value propositions that we offer in terms of monitoring and reduced O&M expenses and recovering loss of energy due to mismatch in particular, with the extensive use of bifacial modules that are out there. So that's a big part of the qualification work that we are going into is ensuring that we know how to quantify for our customers the benefit including adding features and capabilities that will allow them to save some money on other elements of their their operational aspects. So that's indeed the challenge, and that's what we are preparing for this product. And in that regard, I think, encourage you to attend the Analyst Day where we can get into that in more detail. looking at regions and customers, and this is an experience that we've gone through also initially with residential and then with C&I is you start with early adopters that for one reason or another, have a view that they need this type of capability. Sometimes it's a large project that are on uneven land. Sometimes they might have other constraints that make it an easier decision for them to adopt this type of technology. And then over time, they understand the broad benefits and then start adopting it for their normal installations and then other people start adopting it as well. So I assume that we'll go through a similar path, and we're actually at the beginning of that path already today in small and then larger utility, but all along, optimizing the value compared to the relative increased cost."

We are happy to be announcing a record revenue quarter of $526 million. We are seeing growing demand for our existing products across all segments and regions and strong interest in our pipeline of new products. In fact, we have already secured orders for delivery in Q4 and in Q1 of more than 4 gigawatts of AC nameplate inverters compared to 1.9 gigawatts that we shipped in this quarter, and we are still receiving additional orders for this period. 
In today's call, I will address the temporary headwinds that we are facing on the operational side, which will clarify our next quarter guidance which does not fully reflect the high demand for our products and our anticipated continued growth. In the last earnings release, we updated that production in our factory in Vietnam have been partially suspended due to a government-enforced, COVID-related lockdown. We explained that assuming the interruption would be short as we were expecting at the time, we would compensate for it by increasing capacity in our other factories, and this is indeed what we did. However, the shutdown ended up being longer and more extensive than expected, practically putting to a halt our manufacturing capacity in Vietnam for 12 weeks. 
Prior to this event, the Vietnam factory was providing between 20% and 25% of our capacity and the vast majority of our nontariff shipments to the U.S. market. So while we increased capacity in the other sites to partially compensate for it, this shutdown created a gap in supply of products for the fourth quarter that will take some time to replenish and which will come at a higher cost due to the need for expedited shipments and due to tariffs from shipping more China-made products to the U.S. We are, therefore, guiding moderate revenue growth for the fourth quarter at a reduced gross margin. 
The production in the Vietnam factory resumed October 1 and is gradually ramping back to full capacity, which is expected in mid-November. Unrelated to these events in Vietnam, we have been working for some time to build redundancy and expand our manufacturing footprint with a new contract manufacturing site in Mexico. We expect first products to ship from the facility in the first half of 2022. And once ramped, this site will significantly increase our capacity and give us further flexibility to manage growing demand from the U.S. markets. 
As is indicated in our record revenue results in the third quarter, we experienced healthy demand for our products and ended the quarter with record backlog. While this is not a data point we usually provide and do not plan to do in the future, it is reflective of the commitments of our customers and their strong demand for our products. To that end, other than in some unique cases of extreme logistical costs, where we will share some of those costs with our customers, order level, we do not currently plan to increase prices on deliveries this year. Our customers have trusted us with their early orders, and we value their loyalty. To sum up this topic, we are happy with the record third quarter results and are focused on quickly closing the capacity gap created from the temporary factory closure in Vietnam, while ensuring we are meeting the needs of our customers. 
I'd like to share now some new product news, which is a big part of the demand increase we are seeing. The first is our Energy Bank residential battery. Production of the batteries is ramping at a good pace, and we have installations already in the U.S., Italy, Germany, England, Belgium and first deliveries in Australia. This quarter, we manufactured and shipped approximately 20-megawatt hour of Energy Bank batteries, a bit below what we had anticipated. In Q4, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour compensating for the delays from this quarter. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, we expect to reach production output of 300 Energy Bank batteries per day or 180-megawatt hours per quarter. 
In parallel to ramping battery shipments, we continue to see strong demand for our Energy Hub Inverter, where shipments were up from 21,000 units in the second quarter to 37,000 units in the third quarter. We also began shipments of the high-powered version of the Energy Hub Inverter with up to 11.4 kilowatt AC nameplate capacity and industry-leading 10.3 kilowatt continuous backup power per inverter. Considering the current trends of increased electrification and needs for resilience, we expect average system size and the required power consumption in case of backup to increase as well, and as such, increased adoption of this configuration due to its capacity and power level. The availability of this inverter will also provide cost savings for our customers, who until today, in many cases, have used multiple inverters to achieve these capacities and power levels. 
As battery attach rates and the interest in resilience intensifies, we are seeing strong interest globally in the combined Energy Hub, Energy Bank solution, which offers a DC-coupled system that harvests more of the energy generated by the modules and feeds it into the battery, even when the power generated by the solar system exceeds the nameplate capacity of the inverter. An additional milestone on the product front is that we began installations in Japan of our JET-certified HD Wave inverter, which through a built-in AC socket enables direct power consumption from solar in case of power outage. This is a significant step for SolarEdge towards opening the large residential market in Japan where this capability is mandated by regulation. 
Shifting to our offering of optimizers. In the third quarter, we began shipments in some regions of our fourth-generation optimizer that among other improvements, enables high efficiency optimization of newer-generation solar modules with higher electrical currents. Additionally, this new optimizer is designed to incorporate the new safety mechanism. In some cases, electrical arcs and safety events are caused by loose connectors or damage caused to cabling from rodents or other various causes. In the new optimizer, we have incorporated a capability that actively measures the temperature at the connectors to detect excessive heat even before it turns into electrical arc. 
This past quarter, we shipped more than 200,000 of these S-Series generation 4 optimizers, and we will continue to ramp in the coming quarters. 
On the commercial side, we continue to see increased activity driven, among other reasons, by corporations looking to reduce their carbon footprint via solar installations on their facilities. Many of these corporations choose the SolarEdge solution due to our safety and monitoring capabilities. In many cases, we are leveraging success at one site for global proliferation to other sites of these international corporations. 
On the smaller utility side, this quarter, we installed our first ground mount installation of our new 330-kilowatt inverter. This 1 megawatt installation has 3 inverters and thousands of optimizers. These new 1.3 kilowatt optimizers are especially designed for this inverter from a performance and cost point of view, and to fit the solar modules typically used in ground mount installation that are typically high power, and in many cases, bifacial. The experience from this installation will assist us as we ramp reduction in sales of this offering in 2022. 
Turning to our nonsolar business, where we had a record quarter in revenues driven from our nonsolar storage business. This is despite the lower-than-planned shipments in the e-mobility business due to instability in the automotive industry. While our ability to deliver has ramped on schedule, considering the current trends in the automotive industry, we expect to end up delivering approximately $70 million from the e-Mobility business for 2021. 
I will now hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results. Ronen?"

Segment profit is comprised of gross profit of the segment less operating expenses that do not include amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses and certain other items. Total revenues for the third quarter were a record $526.4 million, a 10% increase compared to $480.1 million last quarter and a 56% increase compared to $338.1 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the solar segment were a record $476.8 million, an 11% increase compared to $431.4 million last quarter and a 53% increase compared to $312.5 million for the same quarter last year. 
Overall, this quarter, we shipped approximately 4.7 million power optimizers and approximately 231,000 inverters. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $188.6 million and represented 39.5% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were a record $234.5 million or 49.2% of our solar revenues. The revenues in Europe were driven by record results in Germany and Italy, which grew over 50% quarter-over-quarter as well as record revenues in Poland and France. Rest of the world solar revenues were $53.7 million or 11.3% of our total solar revenues. The revenues in rest of the world were led by sales in Australia, Japan and Israel and record quarter in Taiwan and Thailand. 
On a megawatt basis, we shipped 592 megawatts to the United States, 1,029 megawatts to Europe and 282 megawatts to the rest of the world. 39% of this amount was commercial products and the remaining 61% were residential. ASP per watt, excluding battery revenues this quarter, was $0.255, a 5.2% decrease from $0.269 last quarter, resulting from a lower portion of U.S. shipments and customer mix as well as higher proportion of inverters in our overall mix. This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 63.8% of our solar revenues. Two U.S. customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenues each. This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar business were a record $49.5 million, led by record sales of lithium-ion batteries from our nonsolar storage business. 
GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 32.5% in the prior quarter and 32% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 34% compared to 33.9% in the prior quarter and 33.5% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the solar segment was 36.6% compared to 37.4% in the prior quarter. As detailed by Zvi, the solar segment gross margin was negatively impacted by measures taken to compensate for our temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Vietnam. This shutdown, which was compensated by more deliveries from our China factory, reduced our nontariff shipments to a 53% of the products sent to the United States this quarter compared to 88% in the second quarter. In total, the additional logistic costs and tariffs, together with some component and raw material price increases added 110 basis points compared to our previous quarter. Our accrual for future warranty claims also rose this quarter, partially because of the increase in product costs and partially due to the increase in our overall installed base. We expect this phenomenon to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for our nonsolar segment was 8.7% compared to 3.3% in the previous quarter due to healthy margins from the storage business and continued improvement of margins in the e-Mobility business. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the third quarter were $83.8 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $81.5 million or 17% of revenues in the prior quarter and $63.2 million or 18.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This growth year-over-year reflects continued investment in our expansion of our R&D and sales capabilities. 
Our solar segment operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 14.6% compared to 15.8% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was -- for the quarter was a record $95.2 million compared to $81.3 million in the previous quarter and $50 million for the same period last year. This quarter, solar segment generated a record operating profit of $104.9 million compared to an operating profit of $92.9 million last quarter. This number represents 22% of our solar revenues and is above the midpoint of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. 
The nonsolar segment generated an operating loss of $9.7 million, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $11.6 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP financial expenses for the quarter was $3 million compared to non-GAAP financial income of $1.7 million in the previous quarter. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $10.5 million in the previous quarter and $1.6 million for the same period last year. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $53 million compared to a GAAP net income of $45.1 million in the previous quarter and $43.8 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $82.1 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $72.5 million in the previous quarter and $65.9 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.96 for the third quarter compared to $0.82 in the previous quarter and $0.83 in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $1.45 compared to $1.28 in the previous quarter and $1.21 in the same quarter last year. 
Turning now to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $524.1 million. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated $61.8 million of cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter to $416.2 million compared to $343.7 million last quarter. Day sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 90 days, an increase from 76 days last quarter, a result of higher revenues generated in the later part of the quarter and an increase in sales to large customers that enjoy more favorable credit terms in the overall mix. 
As of September 30, 2021, our inventory level net of reserves was at $304.7 million compared to $321.9 million in the prior quarter. Most of this reduction is related to lower level of finished goods in the solar segment, while raw material level increased in the solar segment to support manufacturing amidst the global component shortages and slightly decreased in the nonsolar segment. 
Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. As explained throughout this call, due to the shutdown of our factory in Vietnam in the third quarter and its gradual return to normal operations and in light of the strong demand, our fourth quarter guidance is for moderate growth at temporary reduced gross margin. As such, for the fourth quarter of 2021, we are guiding revenues to be within the range of $530 million to $560 million. Revenues from the solar segment are expected to be within the range of $490 million and $515 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour of residential storage systems to the United States and Europe as we continue to ramp the manufacturing of this product. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 30% to 32%. Gross margin for the solar segment is expected to be within the range of 31% to 34%. 
Before opening the line for questions, I would like to update that we are planning for an Analyst Day to be held towards the end of the first quarter of 2022. We will, of course, announce the specific date closer to this time.

And then in terms of sort of lead times you're quoting on that backlog mix, just to get a sense of how far that stretches out. And it sounds to me like you're saying that because of the backlog and because of the supply chain and manufacturing issues, Q1 should be seasonally much better, maybe better than the modest growth we're seeing here just for Q4, but can you kind of maybe encompass all of that in the context of your backlog, the trends you're seeing and how it impacts into Q1?

So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- or orders for shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts. And in the third quarter, which was a record quarter, we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of inverters. And",318,"Yes, Brian. So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- or orders for shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts. And in the third quarter, which was a record quarter, we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of inverters. And we're using here inverters as the reference point. It's not a matter of -- it doesn't include batteries and it's not including the optimizers, it's just the way to compare. So the record Q3 was 1.9. And today, we are with backlog for deliveries in the next 2 quarters of more than 4 gigawatts. 
To the second part of the question, so indeed, the -- or let me touch on lead times, and I mentioned this as well. So as you know, we have a very wide variety of products and offering and the lead times vary by product. We are still taking -- we're taking few orders for delivery in Q4, unless it's some specific products where we have access and availability and -- but we are still taking orders in Q1. So for most of the products, the lead times are in the range of 12 to 14 weeks. On some commercial products, it's a bit longer than that. And on the batteries, it's a bit longer than that as well. So it's anything that ranges from call it, 12 weeks to 16, 18 weeks on batteries. 
And the outlook for Q1 is obviously complex, and there are many, many moving parts and unknowns. But generally speaking, with our plans for recovering production capacity in Vietnam as well as from the other factories, we do expect to see growth, in particular, on the top line. From a margin perspective, Q1 will still be challenging in getting that equipment quickly and on time to the customers when and where they need it. So we expect still some margin headwinds in Q1."

So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when your manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call, the first thi",958,"Sure, Brian. So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when your manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call, the first thing that we did was actually to divert a lot of our manufacturing to China. And this is something that creates, first, 2 issues. The first one is that you need to start now rotating some of the components that were shipped to Vietnam into China in order to make sure that you have the right components at the right place. And of course, we remember that this is all happening while there are component challenges worldwide. And therefore, this by itself creates expenses related to simply mobilizing quickly large amount of components from one site to the other, usually on expedited shipment. 
The second part of this diversion, I would call, is the fact that while you're expediting some of the shipments, the cost of these expedited shipments also increased dramatically over the last few months as we know from what we see all over the world. And therefore, you get like a double effect that even to be able to compensate for the manufacturing in cell itself, you need to pay much more to bring components in. 
Now we go into the manufacturing. And the idea is that in a normal way of operation, you would usually use your capacity to ship as much as you can using ocean freight to accumulate products close to your customers in our warehouses in Europe and the United States and then ship them locally, all using regular ocean freight and in some cases, of course, ground transportation. Once this capacity is gone, you basically live from the head to -- from your hand to the mouth in a sense. Meaning that wherever you are manufacturing, in China, in Israel and in Hungary, you're trying to push as quickly as possible to your customers because they count on you and they know that they need to get products in order to install them. And the only way to do it is simply by sending expedited shipments. And again, expedited shipments more than quadrupled and sometimes even 6x more expensive today than they were a few quarters ago. And then you see a double effect of these expedited shipments. 
And the last thing, of course, is the tariffs on Chinese products. And as I said in my part of the transcript is that our nontariff shipments to the U.S. went down to 53% from 88% last quarter. So in Q3, the effect of all of this was relatively marginal because on one hand, we still had inventories that were on more regular shipments coming -- that were manufactured in Q2 and came to Europe and the United States in the regular way. And we did observe some of the costs of shipping the components from one location to the other. And you see it in this 110 basis points increase that are also including a little bit of tariffs that were paid when we entered this Chinese product to the United States. But actually, some of these costs are actually capitalized on a product that we brought in Q3 and we're going to sell in Q4. And this is the 110%. 
If we look now into Q4, what we're going to see is that we'll see approximately 300 to 350 basis points coming from the accumulations of the effect. And that means that now, we're not just shipping components that are maybe smaller and in lower volumes from -- in an expedited way from one factory to the other, we actually start shipping large product by air or by expedited shipments to their final destination. And at this point, we do not have any more products coming to the U.S. from our Vietnam facilities from the last quarter, simply because this factory was practically down. And those manufacturing that we're doing in Vietnam are not yet coming to the U.S. and allowing us to enjoy the nontariff regions. So in general, what we see is that in Q4, we're basically getting or absorbed most of the hit from the lack of manufacturing in Vietnam and of course, the expedited shipment that is created from this. 
[ When it is going to clear? ] In Q1, first of all, we expect Vietnam sometimes in November, as we said, to go back to normal levels. And therefore, some of the goods will still be sent in an expedited manner to customers to meet Q4 demand, but some of it will be shipped -- no, no, Q4, and then some of it will be shipped to Q -- for Q1 in order to make sure that we have enough inventories to begin the quarter. In the same time, also, again, the manufacturing in China that is now regulated will start to go in a less expedited manner. And therefore, in Q1, we will still see some effect that are residual from Q4, but you'll start to see an improvement. 
And towards Q2 where, hopefully, unless there are more COVID waves, we will see continued manufacturing in all of our factories that have excess capacity above this demand, we will be able to come back to this, I would call it, normal shipment methodology or a system of ocean freight. So it's a little bit of a lengthy explanation, but the idea is that lack of manufacturing in Q4 -- Q3 is becoming more expensive in COGS in Q4. The improvement in Q4 is contributing to improved margins in Q1. And in Q2, hopefully, we're supposed to be back to the normal margins."

So compared to where we are today, Mexico is going to be dramatically cheaper than Vietnam. I think that once we're starting to manufacture in Mexico, and at the same time, ocean freight is going back to normal, I would assume that the difference is, of course, better in manufacturing in Mexico but not as dramatic. 
But I think that there's another thing that needs to be taken into account, and this is also related to inventory levels and the capital -- uses of capital because the line today from Vietnam to the United States is approximately 6 weeks where products are on a ship before they are being distributed. And once you're manufacturing in Mexico, we're talking about 1 week to 10 days at most. And that means that we can also make our inventory management more efficient. So -- and of course, this is something that also save costs. So I think it's going to be cheaper. It's a little bit hard to evaluate it right now."

So we are managing through this complex environment, and there's a lot of juggling going on, and R&D resources that are working on qualifying alternative sources in order to make sure that we are never short on what we really need in order to deliver.

So the situation is challenging. But again, we're managing through it.

So the practice that in recent -- in the last year has become a regulatory mandate in Japan to have with every installation or with every inverter, a -- what they call a utility outlet or a small AC socket that you can pull power from if there's an outage without -- in the local storage. So we developed that technology for the sake of the Japanese market. The Japanese residential market is a very interesting market, and it's -- and on one hand, you have to be patient when trying to take market share in Japan. And at the same time, some of the benefit that our system provides like enhanced safety monitoring capability, the ability to fit a complex roost, all of those are very relevant for the Japanese residential market. So we're optimistic about the potential within this residential market, and that's why we developed the technology, and we are productizing it for Japan. 
It could be productized for other markets, but I think if you look at the global market, there are 2 overriding trends that are impacting the topic of storage. It's the increase of electrification, of -- in the homes. So whether it's through shifting to EV or electrifying HVAC, the capacity and power requirements of the home are increasing. And at the same time, grid instability is causing the need and drive towards resilience. So the real solution for what the North American market or European market in terms of resilience, is what we are seeing. People are going to more batteries, larger batteries, larger inverters and larger systems and more attach rates of batteries. That's what we are aiming our offerings in those markets and are optimizing for that capability. That said, we could productize this technology that we have for other markets as well. We'll kind of look and see if that is justified."

So it's a different competitive environment in -- than in the U.S. because there are so many -- there's a very broad offering of low-cost and decent-quality Chinese products. And that's the dynamic of competition in these markets, and it's very different in that regards to the U.S. And we have developed some experience and specific offering for those markets that is -- that reflects that different competitive environment, especially taking to -- into account that there's no rapid shutdown requirements in these markets, so you really are -- or have to be either cost competitive or be able to justify the cost difference compared to the Chinese alternatives that are out there. So it's a very different landscape. And that requires a special type of approach that we've adopted over the years."

And the expectation is to -- that the project will catch up, whether that's going to be in the early part of 2022 in terms of the volumes and -- or later or in 2023, it's really related maybe even to the earlier questions about recovery of the component shortages because that's what's causing these stop-and-start motions in the automotive industry. So it's kind of -- we're a secondary effect to the fact that the OEMs are not producing the base vehicles at the rate that they would want to because of availability of components, and then they don't consume our offering at the rate that was originally planned. So the assumption is, yes, that it's going to catch up. When is -- it's hard to say."

But that part of the rollout is going fine. 
The slightly lower-than-planned output this quarter was really around logistics.

And here, we defer to the -- to getting a little bit more profitability out of the deals. In terms of capacity, definitely, as you mentioned, so the intent is the 130 -- the 180 to 300 batteries a day is the milestone for the end of Q1, and the intent is to ramp that further into 2Q -- Q2 and to consume the capacity of cells that we reported in the previous quarter and even more once we start getting our own cells out of Sella 2 and Kokam."

And as I also mentioned, we are optimizing the cost because the value proposition needs to fit the additional cost to the customer. And there are the classical or the long-term value propositions that we offer in terms of monitoring and reduced O&M expenses and recovering loss of energy due to mismatch in particular, with the extensive use of bifacial modules that are out there. So that's a big part of the qualification work that we are going into is ensuring that we know how to quantify for our customers the benefit including adding features and capabilities that will allow them to save some money on other elements of their operational aspects. So that's indeed the challenge, and that's what we are preparing for this product. And in that regard, I think, to encourage you to attend the Analyst Day where we can get into that in more detail. 
Looking at regions and customers, and this is an experience that we've gone through also initially with residential and then with C&I is you start with early adopters that, for one reason or another, have a view that they need this type of capability. Sometimes it's a large project that are on uneven land. Sometimes they might have other constraints that make it an easier decision for them to adopt this type of technology. And then over time, they understand the broad benefits and then start adopting it for their normal installations and then other people start adopting it as well. So I assume that we'll go through a similar path, and we're actually at the beginning of that path already today in small and then larger utility, but all along, optimizing the value compared to the relative increased cost."

We are happy to be announcing a record revenue quarter of $526 million. We are seeing growing demand for our existing products across all segments and regions and strong interest in our pipeline of new products. In fact, we have already secured orders for delivery in Q4 and in Q1 of more than 4 gigawatts of AC nameplate inverters compared to 1.9 gigawatts that we shipped in this quarter, and we are still receiving additional orders for this period. 
In today's call, I will address the temporary headwinds that we are facing on the operational side, which will clarify our next quarter guidance which does not fully reflect the high demand for our products and our anticipated continued growth. In the last earnings release, we updated that production in our factory in Vietnam had been partially suspended due to a government-enforced, COVID-related lockdown. We explained that assuming the interruption would be short as we were expecting at the time, we would compensate for it by increasing capacity in our other factories, and this is indeed what we did. However, the shutdown ended up being longer and more extensive than expected, practically putting to a halt our manufacturing capacity in Vietnam for 12 weeks. 
Prior to this event, the Vietnam factory was providing between 20% and 25% of our capacity and the vast majority of our nontariff shipments to the U.S. market. So while we increased capacity in the other sites to partially compensate for it, this shutdown created a gap in supply of products for the fourth quarter that will take some time to replenish and which will come at a higher cost due to the need for expedited shipments and due to tariffs from shipping more China-made products to the U.S. We are, therefore, guiding moderate revenue growth for the fourth quarter at a reduced gross margin. 
The production in the Vietnam factory resumed October 1 and is gradually ramping back to full capacity, which is expected in mid-November. Unrelated to these events in Vietnam, we have been working for some time to build redundancy and expand our manufacturing footprint with a new contract manufacturing site in Mexico. We expect first products to ship from the facility in the first half of 2022. And once ramped, this site will significantly increase our capacity and give us further flexibility to manage growing demand from the U.S. markets. 
As is indicated in our record revenue results in the third quarter, we experienced healthy demand for our products and ended the quarter with record backlog. While this is not a data point we usually provide and do not plan to do in the future, it is reflective of the commitments of our customers and their strong demand for our products. To that end, other than in some unique cases of extreme logistical costs, where we will share some of those costs with our customers, order level, we do not currently plan to increase prices on deliveries this year. Our customers have trusted us with their early orders, and we value their loyalty. To sum up this topic, we are happy with the record third quarter results and are focused on quickly closing the capacity gap created from the temporary factory closure in Vietnam, while ensuring we are meeting the needs of our customers. 
I'd like to share now some new product news, which is a big part of the demand increase we are seeing. The first is our Energy Bank residential battery. Production of the batteries is ramping at a good pace, and we have installations already in the U.S., Italy, Germany, England, Belgium and first deliveries in Australia. This quarter, we manufactured and shipped approximately 20-megawatt hour of Energy Bank batteries, a bit below what we had anticipated. In Q4, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour compensating for the delays from this quarter. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, we expect to reach production output of 300 Energy Bank batteries per day or 180-megawatt hours per quarter. 
In parallel to ramping battery shipments, we continue to see strong demand for our Energy Hub Inverter, where shipments were up from 21,000 units in the second quarter to 37,000 units in the third quarter. We also began shipments of the high-powered version of the Energy Hub Inverter with up to 11.4 kilowatt AC nameplate capacity and industry-leading 10.3 kilowatt continuous backup power per inverter. Considering the current trends of increased electrification and needs for resilience, we expect average system size and the required power consumption in case of backup to increase as well, and as such, increased adoption of this configuration due to its capacity and power level. The availability of this inverter will also provide cost savings for our customers, who until today, in many cases, have used multiple inverters to achieve these capacities and power levels. 
As battery attach rates and the interest in resilience intensifies, we are seeing strong interest globally in the combined Energy Hub, Energy Bank solution, which offers a DC-coupled system that harvests more of the energy generated by the modules and feeds it into the battery, even when the power generated by the solar system exceeds the nameplate capacity of the inverter. An additional milestone on the product front is that we began installations in Japan of our JET-certified HD Wave inverter, which through a built-in AC socket enables direct power consumption from solar in case of power outage. This is a significant step for SolarEdge towards opening the large residential market in Japan where this capability is mandated by regulation. 
Shifting to our offering of optimizers. In the third quarter, we began shipments in some regions of our fourth-generation optimizer that among other improvements, enables high efficiency optimization of newer-generation solar modules with higher electrical currents. Additionally, this new optimizer is designed to incorporate the new safety mechanism. In some cases, electrical arcs and safety events are caused by loose connectors or damage caused to cabling from rodents or other various causes. In the new optimizer, we have incorporated a capability that actively measures the temperature at the connectors to detect excessive heat even before it turns into electrical arc. 
This past quarter, we shipped more than 200,000 of these S-Series generation 4 optimizers, and we will continue to ramp in the coming quarters. 
On the commercial side, we continue to see increased activity driven, among other reasons, by corporations looking to reduce their carbon footprint via solar installations on their facilities. Many of these corporations choose the SolarEdge solution due to our safety and monitoring capabilities. In many cases, we are leveraging success at one site for global proliferation to other sites of these international corporations. 
On the smaller utility side, this quarter, we installed our first ground mount installation of our new 330-kilowatt inverter. This 1 megawatt installation has 3 inverters and thousands of optimizers. These new 1.3 kilowatt optimizers are especially designed for this inverter from a performance and cost point of view, and to fit the solar modules typically used in ground mount installation that are typically high power, and in many cases, bifacial. The experience from this installation will assist us as we ramp production and sales of this offering in 2022. 
Turning to our nonsolar business, where we had a record quarter in revenues driven from our nonsolar storage business. This is despite the lower-than-planned shipments in the e-mobility business due to instability in the automotive industry. While our ability to deliver has ramped on schedule, considering the current trends in the automotive industry, we expect to end up delivering approximately $70 million from the e-Mobility business for 2021. 
I will now hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results. Ronen?"

Segment profit is comprised of gross profit of the segment less operating expenses that do not include amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses and certain other items. Total revenues for the third quarter were a record $526.4 million, a 10% increase compared to $480.1 million last quarter and a 56% increase compared to $338.1 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the solar segment were a record $476.8 million, an 11% increase compared to $431.4 million last quarter and a 53% increase compared to $312.5 million for the same quarter last year. 
Overall, this quarter, we shipped approximately 4.7 million power optimizers and approximately 231,000 inverters. U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $188.6 million and represented 39.5% of our solar revenues. Solar revenues from Europe were a record $234.5 million or 49.2% of our solar revenues. The revenues in Europe were driven by record results in Germany and Italy, which grew over 50% quarter-over-quarter as well as record revenues in Poland and France. Rest of the world solar revenues were $53.7 million or 11.3% of our total solar revenues. The revenues in rest of the world were led by sales in Australia, Japan and Israel and record quarter in Taiwan and Thailand. 
On a megawatt basis, we shipped 592 megawatts to the United States, 1,029 megawatts to Europe and 282 megawatts to the rest of the world. 39% of this amount was commercial products and the remaining 61% were residential. ASP per watt, excluding battery revenues this quarter, was $0.255, a 5.2% decrease from $0.269 last quarter, resulting from a lower portion of U.S. shipments and customer mix as well as higher proportion of inverters in our overall mix. This quarter, our top 10 solar customers represented 63.8% of our solar revenues. Two U.S. customers accounted for more than 10% of our solar revenues each. This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar business were a record $49.5 million, led by record sales of lithium-ion batteries from our nonsolar storage business. 
GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 32.5% in the prior quarter and 32% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 34% compared to 33.9% in the prior quarter and 33.5% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the solar segment was 36.6% compared to 37.4% in the prior quarter. As detailed by Zvi, the solar segment gross margin was negatively impacted by measures taken to compensate for our temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Vietnam. This shutdown, which was compensated by more deliveries from our China factory, reduced our nontariff shipments to a 53% of the products sent to the United States this quarter compared to 88% in the second quarter. In total, the additional logistic costs and tariffs, together with some component and raw material price increases added 110 basis points compared to our previous quarter. Our accrual for future warranty claims also rose this quarter, partially because of the increase in product costs and partially due to the increase in our overall installed base. We expect this phenomenon to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for our nonsolar segment was 8.7% compared to 3.3% in the previous quarter due to healthy margins from the storage business and continued improvement of margins in the e-Mobility business. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the third quarter were $83.8 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $81.5 million or 17% of revenues in the prior quarter and $63.2 million or 18.7% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This growth year-over-year reflects continued investment in our expansion of our R&D and sales capabilities. 
Our solar segment operating expenses as a percentage of solar revenues were 14.6% compared to 15.8% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was -- for the quarter was a record $95.2 million compared to $81.3 million in the previous quarter and $50 million for the same period last year. This quarter, solar segment generated a record operating profit of $104.9 million compared to an operating profit of $92.9 million last quarter. This number represents 22% of our solar revenues and is above the midpoint of our 20% to 23% long-term operating profit model. 
The nonsolar segment generated an operating loss of $9.7 million, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $11.6 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP financial expenses for the quarter was $3 million compared to non-GAAP financial income of $1.7 million in the previous quarter. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $10.5 million in the previous quarter and $1.6 million for the same period last year. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $53 million compared to a GAAP net income of $45.1 million in the previous quarter and $43.8 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $82.1 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $72.5 million in the previous quarter and $65.9 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.96 for the third quarter compared to $0.82 in the previous quarter and $0.83 in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $1.45 compared to $1.28 in the previous quarter and $1.21 in the same quarter last year. 
Turning now to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $524.1 million. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated $61.8 million of cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter to $416.2 million compared to $343.7 million last quarter. Day sales outstanding this quarter in the solar business was 90 days, an increase from 76 days last quarter, a result of higher revenues generated in the later part of the quarter and an increase in sales to large customers that enjoy more favorable credit terms in the overall mix. 
As of September 30, 2021, our inventory level net of reserves was at $304.7 million compared to $321.9 million in the prior quarter. Most of this reduction is related to lower level of finished goods in the solar segment, while raw material level increased in the solar segment to support manufacturing amidst the global component shortages and slightly decreased in the nonsolar segment. 
Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. As explained throughout this call, due to the shutdown of our factory in Vietnam in the third quarter and its gradual return to normal operations and in light of the strong demand, our fourth quarter guidance is for moderate growth at temporary reduced gross margin. As such, for the fourth quarter of 2021, we are guiding revenues to be within the range of $530 million to $560 million. Revenues from the solar segment are expected to be within the range of $490 million and $515 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship approximately 70-megawatt hour of residential storage systems to the United States and Europe as we continue to ramp the manufacturing of this product. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 30% to 32%. Gross margin for the solar segment is expected to be within the range of 31% to 34%. 
Before opening the line for questions, I would like to update that we are planning for an Analyst Day to be held towards the end of the first quarter of 2022. We will, of course, announce the specific date closer to this time. 
Operator, we can now take questions, please."

And then in terms of sort of lead times you're quoting on that backlog mix, just to get a sense of how far that stretches out. And it sounds to me like you're saying that because of the backlog and because of the supply chain and manufacturing issues, Q1 should be seasonally much better, maybe better than the modest growth we're seeing here just for Q4, but can you kind of maybe encompass all of that in the context of your backlog, the trends you're seeing and how it impacts into Q1?

So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- or orders for shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts. And in the third quarter, which was a record quarter, we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of inverters. And",318,"Yes, Brian. So starting from the backlog, as we mentioned, we're today with backlog -- or orders for shipment in Q4 and Q1 combined of more than 4 gigawatts. And in the third quarter, which was a record quarter, we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of inverters. And we're using here inverters as the reference point. It's not a matter of -- it doesn't include batteries and it's not including the optimizers, it's just the way to compare. So the record Q3 was 1.9. And today, we are with backlog for deliveries in the next 2 quarters of more than 4 gigawatts. 
To the second part of the question, so indeed, the -- or let me touch on lead times, and I mentioned this as well. So as you know, we have a very wide variety of products and offering and the lead times vary by product. We are still taking -- we're taking few orders for delivery in Q4, unless it's some specific products where we have access and availability and -- but we are still taking orders in Q1. So for most of the products, the lead times are in the range of 12 to 14 weeks. On some commercial products, it's a bit longer than that. And on the batteries, it's a bit longer than that as well. So it's anything that ranges from call it, 12 weeks to 16, 18 weeks on batteries. 
And the outlook for Q1 is obviously complex, and there are many, many moving parts and unknowns. But generally speaking, with our plans for recovering production capacity in Vietnam as well as from the other factories, we do expect to see growth, in particular, on the top line. From a margin perspective, Q1 will still be challenging in getting that equipment quickly and on time to the customers when and where they need it. So we expect still some margin headwinds in Q1."

Maybe if you could break down some of the pieces and maybe the potential time frames for when they come back to a more normal state."

So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when your manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call, the first thi",958,"Sure, Brian. So first of all, in order to explain this, let's understand the mechanism that is actually creating the margin headwinds. In general, when your manufacturing capacity disappears by about 20% to 25%, as Zvi mentioned in the call, the first thing that we did was actually to divert a lot of our manufacturing to China. And this is something that creates, first, 2 issues. The first one is that you need to start now rotating some of the components that were shipped to Vietnam into China in order to make sure that you have the right components at the right place. And of course, we remember that this is all happening while there are component challenges worldwide. And therefore, this by itself creates expenses related to simply mobilizing quickly large amount of components from one site to the other, usually on expedited shipment. 
The second part of this diversion, I would call, is the fact that while you're expediting some of the shipments, the cost of these expedited shipments also increased dramatically over the last few months as we know from what we see all over the world. And therefore, you get like a double effect that even to be able to compensate for the manufacturing in cell itself, you need to pay much more to bring components in. 
Now we go into the manufacturing. And the idea is that in a normal way of operation, you would usually use your capacity to ship as much as you can using ocean freight to accumulate products close to your customers in our warehouses in Europe and the United States and then ship them locally, all using regular ocean freight and in some cases, of course, ground transportation. Once this capacity is gone, you basically live from the head to -- from your hand to the mouth in a sense. Meaning that whatever you are manufacturing, in China, in Israel and in Hungary, you're trying to push as quickly as possible to your customers because they count on you and they know that they need to get products in order to install them. And the only way to do it is simply by sending expedited shipments. And again, expedited shipments more than quadrupled and sometimes even 6x more expensive today than they were a few quarters ago. And then you see a double effect of these expedited shipments. 
And the last thing, of course, is the tariffs on Chinese products. And as I said in my part of the transcript is that our nontariff shipments to the U.S. went down to 53% from 88% last quarter. So in Q3, the effect of all of this was relatively marginal because on one hand, we still had inventories that were on more regular shipments coming -- that were manufactured in Q2 and came to Europe and the United States in the regular way. And we did absorb some of the costs of shipping the components from one location to the other. And you see it in this 110 basis points increase that are also including a little bit of tariffs that were paid when we entered this Chinese product to the United States. But actually, some of these costs are actually capitalized on a product that we brought in Q3 and we're going to sell in Q4. And this is the 110%. 
If we look now into Q4, what we're going to see is that we'll see approximately 300 to 350 basis points coming from the accumulations of the effect. And that means that now, we're not just shipping components that are maybe smaller and in lower volumes from -- in an expedited way from one factory to the other, we actually start shipping large product by air or by expedited shipments to their final destination. And at this point, we do not have any more products coming to the U.S. from our Vietnam facilities from the last quarter, simply because this factory was practically down. And those manufacturing that we're doing in Vietnam are not yet coming to the U.S. and allowing us to enjoy the nontariff regions. So in general, what we see is that in Q4, we're basically getting or absorbed most of the hit from the lack of manufacturing in Vietnam and of course, the expedited shipment that is created from this. 
[ When it is going to clear? ] In Q1, first of all, we expect Vietnam sometimes in November, as we said, to go back to normal levels. And therefore, some of the goods will still be sent in an expedited manner to customers to meet Q4 demand, but some of it will be shipped -- no, no, Q4, and then some of it will be shipped to Q -- for Q1 in order to make sure that we have enough inventories to begin the quarter. In the same time, also, again, the manufacturing in China that is now regulated will start to go in a less expedited manner. And therefore, in Q1, we will still see some effect that are residual from Q4, but you'll start to see an improvement. 
And towards Q2 where, hopefully, unless there are more COVID waves, we will see continued manufacturing in all of our factories that have excess capacity above this demand, we will be able to come back to this, I would call it, normal shipment methodology or a system of ocean freight. So it's a little bit of a lengthy explanation, but the idea is that lack of manufacturing in Q4 -- Q3 is becoming more expensive in COGS in Q4. The improvement in Q4 is contributing to improved margins in Q1. And in Q2, hopefully, we're supposed to be back to the normal margins."

So compared to where we are today, Mexico is going to be dramatically cheaper than Vietnam. I think that once we're starting to manufacture in Mexico, and at the same time, ocean freight is going back to normal, I would assume that the difference is, of course, better in manufacturing in Mexico but not as dramatic. 
But I think that there's another thing that needs to be taken into account, and this is also related to inventory levels and the capital -- uses of capital because the line today from Vietnam to the United States is approximately 6 weeks where products are on a ship before they are being distributed. And once you're manufacturing in Mexico, we're talking about 1 week to 10 days at most. And that means that we can also make our inventory management more efficient. So -- and of course, this is something that also save costs. So I think it's going to be cheaper. It's a little bit hard to evaluate it right now."

You're also growing in the volume of the existing products and also trying to release high volumes of new products because the kind of practice in the components business is that they allocate for you something that you received the prior year, maybe with a slight increase, and they expect you to be happy with that.

So the practice that in recent -- in the last year has become a regulatory mandate in Japan to have with every installation or with every inverter, a -- what they call a utility outlet or a small AC socket that you can pull power from if there's an outage without any local storage. So we developed that technology for the sake of the Japanese market. The Japanese residential market is a very interesting market, and it's -- and on one hand, you have to be patient when trying to take market share in Japan. And at the same time, some of the benefit that our system provides like enhanced safety monitoring capability, the ability to fit a complex roost, all of those are very relevant for the Japanese residential market. So we're optimistic about the potential within this residential market, and that's why we developed the technology, and we are productizing it for Japan. 
It could be productized for other markets, but I think if you look at the global market, there are 2 overriding trends that are impacting the topic of storage. It's the increase of electrification, of -- in the homes. So whether it's through shifting to EV or electrifying HVAC, the capacity and power requirements of the home are increasing. And at the same time, grid instability is causing the need and drive towards resilience. So the real solution for what the North American market or European market in terms of resilience, is what we are seeing. People are going to more batteries, larger batteries, larger inverters and larger systems and more attach rates of batteries. That's what we are aiming our offerings in those markets and are optimizing for that capability. That said, we could productize this technology that we have for other markets as well. We'll kind of look and see if that is justified."

The -- assessing market share in the U.S. residential market is tough. There are indicators, internal and external and third-party that kind of show a small swing in one direction. There's an equal number of indicators by other signs that show a swing in another direction. So looking at all of the data that we see in front of us, I don't think there is a major shift in one direction or another. 
I would say that if you look at something that I think is relatively clear is the growth of the share of the top 10 installers in size of the overall market, and we are typically associated to be stronger with the larger installation companies. So that's a positive indicator from our perspective. But again, it's just one of a bunch of data points and indicators that I'm not sure a firm conclusion could be drawn from."

Once we will go into Sella 2, then, of course, the 2-gigawatt hour capacity that we have and -- can be expanded is something that will allow Kokam to grow much further. 
And in the nonsolar storage business that we see in front of us, either as providing batteries for UPS, for special vehicles, high-power applications and ESS like spinning reserves, I think that there are a lot of opportunities there. But all of those will be, I believe, mostly generated once you'll have Sella 2. And even within this, we need to start producing cells from this product -- this factory, send them to customers to be qualified, and then you'll see an accelerated growth coming after, I believe, 2022 into 2023 and more. But all in all, we basically get the best possible out of the very small factory that we have right now."

And the expectation is to -- that the project will catch up, whether that's going to be in the early part of 2022 in terms of the volumes and -- or later or in 2023, it's really related maybe even to the earlier questions about recovery of the component shortages because that's what's causing these stop-and-start motions in the automotive industry. So it's kind of -- we're a secondary effect to the fact that the OEMs are not producing the base vehicles at the rate that they would want to because of availability of components, and then they don't consume our offering at the rate that was originally planned.

But that part of the rollout is going fine. 
The slightly lower-than-planned output this quarter was really around logistics.

And here, we defer to the -- to getting a little bit more profitability out of the deals. In terms of capacity, definitely, as you mentioned, so the intent is the 130 -- the 180 to 300 batteries a day is the milestone for the end of Q1, and the intent is to ramp that further into 2Q -- Q2 and to consume the capacity of cells that we reported in the previous quarter and even more once we start getting our own cells out of Sella 2 and Kokam."

And as I also mentioned, we are optimizing the cost because the value proposition needs to fit the additional cost to the customer. And there are the classical or the long-term value propositions that we offer in terms of monitoring and reduced O&M expenses and recovering loss of energy due to mismatch in particular, with the extensive use of bifacial modules that are out there. So that's a big part of the qualification work that we are going into is ensuring that we know how to quantify for our customers the benefit including adding features and capabilities that will allow them to save some money on other elements of their operational aspects. So that's indeed the challenge, and that's what we are preparing for this product. And in that regard, I think, to encourage you to attend the Analyst Day where we can get into that in more detail. 
Looking at regions and customers, and this is an experience that we've gone through also initially with residential and then with C&I is you start with early adopters that, for one reason or another, have a view that they need this type of capability. Sometimes it's a large project that are on uneven land. Sometimes they might have other constraints that make it an easier decision for them to adopt this type of technology. And then over time, they understand the broad benefits and then start adopting it for their normal installations and then other people start adopting it as well. So I assume that we'll go through a similar path, and we're actually at the beginning of that path already today in small and then larger utility, but all along, optimizing the value compared to the relative increased cost."
