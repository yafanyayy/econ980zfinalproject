A special thank you to all of our employees for an outstanding quarter to finish the year. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2020 results, then I will review some of our notable achievements in 2020 and also discuss our goals for 2021. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
2020 was a strong year for Paycom. We innovated our sales processes and accelerated our new business sales during the global pandemic. These accomplishments have set the stage for a year of rapid growth that we believe will propel Paycom to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2021. The digital transformation of the human capital management industry has reached a critical stage where the accepted practice of HR and payroll personnel and putting data for employees has come to an end. The industry trend towards self-service has been leading to this point, and I believe the pandemic effectively sealed the fade of the old model. Businesses must shift to provide employees direct access to the database because it's better for the business and the employees. The coming extinction of the old model has been our expectation for many years, and I'm very excited to see it happening. 
Our differentiated solution positions Paycom very well to accelerate this trend and deliver long-term sustainable growth. We finished the year with strong results. Our 2020 fourth quarter revenue of $221 million came in very strong, thanks to elevated new business starts in the quarter. Our full year 2020 revenue of $841 million, grew 14% compared to 2019. 
Paycom maintained an annual revenue retention rate of 93%, even with the pandemic causing some businesses to close and a reduction in employee headcount-related revenue at existing clients. Our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $331 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. Our focus on the sum of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin has served us well in balancing both growth with profitability. And in 2020, we exceeded our recently stated goal of hitting the Rule of 50. With Q1 of 2021 expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic impacts our numbers from a year-over-year perspective, I believe we have an opportunity to reach the Rule of 60 in 2021. Our marketing plan throughout 2020 worked very well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year. In 2021, we plan to continue to spend aggressively on advertising to fuel future revenue growth. And continue to expand our roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution that is stronger than ever for companies of all sizes, including companies well above our stated targeted range. 
We continue to be pulled well above our stated target range as larger companies look to leverage automated processes for their own employees. At the same time, our small business ads continue to increase in 2020, thanks to the efforts of our expanded inside sales force. Growing employee usage of the Paycom system is generating a substantial return on investment for our clients, their employees and Paycom. High employee usage rates, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX, remains strong across our client base. When combined with high adoption of Manager on-the-Go, these applications are creating new opportunities for product innovation and automation. An example of such automation that we've deployed internally is fully automated payroll. It has been our goal to provide our clients with a better employee transaction interface for payroll. BETI, or BETI is that better employee transaction interface. BETI guides individuals through an employee specific payroll process in which they create and approve their own paycheck. This means payroll is completed at period end, which has traditionally been the date in which the payroll department gets started. What used to take entire payroll team's days to aggregate is now fully automated and put directly into the employees' hands. This new approach leverages all of our solutions to produce what we call the perfect payroll and eliminates duplicative processes that can create confusion and inaccuracies when employees don't have visibility or control over their own payroll data. This level of employee controls the future of payroll, and I'm looking forward to being able to roll BETI out to the market in 2021. 
As of December 31, 2020, our headcount stood at approximately 4,200 employees, up 12% year-over-year as we continue to hire high-quality talent throughout the pandemic to further bolster the foundation of our future growth. While greater than 95% of our employees continue working remotely across the country, we look forward to returning to our offices at some point this year, but only when it's safe to do so. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2020. We are in the top 5 ranking in best places to work in the U.S. by top work places and the #1 spot in Oklahoma. And we were named the Fortune 100 fastest-growing companies for the fourth consecutive year. 
These awards are very rewarding and a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture. Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2020 Paycom Jim Thorpe award winner, Trayvon Mari of Texas Christian University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be in Oklahoma. 
To sum up, we address the 2020 challenges with confident result, which enabled our solutions to shine and expose the weaknesses of other disparate systems in the market. The pandemic impact on our pre pandemic client revenue remained stable. And while it's unclear if or when those same clients will add to their employee counts, our continued growth relies on remaining focused on the 3 controllable activities that made 2020 so successful. That is providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. Our commitment to investing through the pandemic generated elevated leads and sales. Once we get past Q1 2021, we will have lapped the pandemics impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. 
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and flexibility. As we said throughout 2020, the pandemic didn't build character, it revealed it. I was glad to see we were all who we thought we were. Your efforts have set us up great for 2021. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"
254225545,701737697,2203183,"Paycom Software, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Paycom Software, Inc.","Executives","Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad me",1176,"Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results with total revenues of $220.9 million, representing growth of roughly 14% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2020 revenue was $841.4 million, representing growth of 14% compared to 2019. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with approximately 31,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 17% compared to 2019. 
On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with approximately 16,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 18% compared to 2019. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $216.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 14% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $188.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 85.9%, also up 20 basis points compared to full year 2019. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $119.1 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $98.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $58.9 million or 26.7% of revenues. We have been very pleased with our marketing strategy throughout 2020, which more than double the demo lead request compared to 2019. And we plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2021. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 10.5% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $33.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $25.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted total R&D costs for the full year 2020, including the capitalized portion, were $118.3 million or 14.1% of total revenues compared to $93.3 million or 12.6% of total revenues in the prior year. Even through the pandemic, we aggressively recruited talent in R&D, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues compared to $78.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 40.6% of total revenues. 
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues compared to $317.9 million or 43.1% of total revenues in 2019. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share-based on approximately $58 million shares versus $45.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share-based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 33.4%. For the full year 2020, our GAAP net income was $143.5 million or $2.46 per diluted share. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share-based on approximately 58 million shares versus $50.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2021 to be approximately $26 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $110 million. For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 27% to 28%. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the first quarter of 2021. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and total debt of $30.9 million related to the construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $52.9 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 433,000 shares for a total of roughly $115 million, including 244,000 shares purchased in the open market. Through December 31, 2020, Paycom has repurchased 4.1 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $423 million, and we currently have $135 million remaining in our buyback program. 
Now let me turn to guidance. With the continued stabilization of our current client revenue base, we are pleased to be able to provide Q1 and full year guidance that is consistent with our historical guidance approach of guiding to what we can see as of today. As a reminder, the effect on our current client revenue of lower headcount at our pre pandemic clients continues to represent a loss of approximately $1.9 million to $2 million in weekly recurring revenue. The impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March of 2020, represents an additional loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue. Also, the first quarter benefits from form filing revenue related to employee tax forms for payrolls run in 2020. We estimate that in Q1 2021, there will be fewer forms filed than normally would have been filed by our client base as a result of fewer employees working in the industry's hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries. Fewer forms filed represents a roughly $6 million to $7 million headwind to Q1 2021 recurring revenue. With these factors in mind, our full year and first quarter 2021 guidance is as follows: for the fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion or approximately 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $396 million to $398 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.3% at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $270 million to $272 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 12% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $126 million to $128 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. 
Q1 2021 is expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic will impact our year-over-year comparisons. After that, our achievement should be more reflective of the strong fundamental growth our business can generate.

But in fact, we did accelerate that this year. And I would have expected our average amount per client to drop a little bit. Based on that, what we actually saw is you're taking about 10% out, let's call it, just on client employees that you can already calculate through our revenue. So you've already got that hit and then the fact that we're selling small business clients. I was a little surprised to see that our average per client held very close to the same. It had been growing for the last several years. But even with the COVID hit, we took in our numbers that average stayed really close to the same. And that came from us continuing to have success selling down market. But also, we're having a lot of success continuing to sell upmarket and continue to be pulled further up. And so those are starting to average each other out. But obviously, you do have some higher unit growth as you look at the down market opportunities."

So no real strong information to give you on exactly the number of quota-carrying employees we added for sales.

I mean we just talked about how we're going to be providing -- our products are going to be doing full-service payroll in the future. I mean, employees are going to be doing their own payroll. And we're starting with that right now internally. We've produced a better employee transaction interface through BETI. And we're going to be rolling that out throughout the year. And so just as employees are used to applying for jobs online. They're used to doing their banking online. They're just -- they're used to doing their shopping online. We're going to be bringing that to the payroll business. I mean it just doesn't make sense that we're not already there to be quite honest with you. It's how businesses win. And when you think about the hours business is save, I mean why can't employers save more on these types of input activities. I mean if you're with Paycom, you could save 100,000 different key strokes. Some of our clients save millions of key strokes every month. So that's where it's going. I don't see the market moving away from that. So all that's to say is I believe in order for people to compete with us that the value proposition is going to be more -- is going to have to more match the value proposition that we're delivering. Because over time, you're going to see more and more differentiation around what the employees do as it relates to data transfer versus what the employer does as it relates to that same topic."

Obviously, I would love for our clients and everybody to get back to normal. I guess what I would say is we're very much focused on new business adds. And however many employees they have at that time is really irrelevant to us. We want to set them up correctly. And we need a certain number of new business adds to cover the losses that we experienced from a current client employee headcount attrition. We need a certain amount of revenue and new clients to cover that, and we've been well on our way to doing that, as I believe is reflected in both our numbers and guidance."

I mean I wouldn't say it's a whole lot different than it's been in the past, but we've continued to see acceleration of larger clients above our range coming to us. In fact, 2 years ago, we moved our range from 2,500, up to 5,000. We continue to see clients well above the 5,000 range coming to us. I mean, the reason why is because they're working with the same employee, whether you're an employee and you work for a 25,000 employee company or whether you're an employee and you work for a 500 employee company, you really dislike manual processes that really become time suckers out of your day. And so all employees would prefer to use something that's extremely easy to use, comprehensive and has quite a bit of consistency. And so -- and that's also better for the employer. And so I think that large businesses in the enterprise level have been trying very hard for a long time to provide a single type solution to their employees because they do realize the importance of that. They've just done it through integration. And we do have a product that works for what they're trying to accomplish that's incredibly scalable. And so I do see us continuing to go up market as we're pulled, and I see us continuing to stay focused on the mid-market. And then as we get leads below 50, we'll continue to sell them as well. But regardless of what size company you work for, you're still the same in person and you're still the same employee and you value things of ease when it comes to task management and HCM. So all that's to say is enterprise products are overcomplicating the the situation for the employee. And a lot of you guys on the call, you know that. You work for companies with large organizations and kind of a mess you have to work with in technology. It's oftentimes an 8 leg at Octopus with no head. So we're fixing that problem in mid-market, and I see us doing the same as we continue to be pulled up market."

It will be what we sell as we go to market, that will be the way to do payroll. We came out with employee self-service in 2002. It was free, and I couldn't even hardly get anybody to look at the product for 2 years. A matter of fact, I wouldn't even until we develop time and attendance online that people started using employee self-service to clock in at time and attendance. And so as we look at this today, I do believe BETI is kind of the cherry on the top of the payroll cake. Even internally here, we've returned over 80% of our hours back to our own payroll department just because of the way we do things now. BETI has you doing the payroll throughout versus waiting to pay period end. So what does that do? Well, it makes it a lot more efficient for every employee as well as there's a lot of work now on the payroll side, they're just not doing. And then you think of all the after the fact corrections, manuals, voids, things that were missed, basically that becomes liability and exposure to the business, which is all going away. And so this is going to happen. Just as nobody gets up from their chair and goes and changes their channel on their TV. And we can all remember the days, those that happened. That's what's going to happen here. Employees are going to do their own payroll and they're going to do their own payroll because that's the easiest way for them to do it. And they're going to do their own payroll because that's how business wins. And a matter of fact, that's the only way business can win at payroll. And so that's what we're driving at. And answer to your question, we're using it internally right now. I would expect in second quarter, we'll have our first clients on it. And then third and fourth quarter, I would see us really starting to roll it out as we move those usage patterns and really move the way people start thinking about payroll instead of starting payroll when the period ends, you start it when it begins in the payrolls over pay period. So that's what we're driving at. I believe it's the most significant product that we've ever developed at Paycom to be quite honest with you because it fully automates a very complicated task that there's little to 0 room actually for inaccuracies. Payroll has got to be perfect. If you're 99.99% accurate in payroll, you get an F. Employees expect it to be perfect. They expect it to be in their bank account, and they're not even really going to thank you for it. It's an expectation for the work they're doing. And so we're going to make sure that happens. And we're going to put that responsibility as well as confirmation ability in the hands of the employees, which is where it's already at right now. Nobody other than an employee themselves knows if they got paid, everything that they should have been paid. And it's best to have them confirm that and be a part of that transaction. So that's what we're going to do, and I would see us rolling this out throughout the year. As far as when does it become popular, when does it become a thing. Like I said, took us a while to get people to use employee self-service when we first came out with it. I don't think this is going to take as long as that because we've been really focused on the usage patterns that drives us toward this, and we're real close to being there now. So you're going to have those early adopters, then you're going to have the middle group, and then we'll have everybody else after that, and we'll just kind of have to see long that takes. But very excited about it, and this will be a product that we're charging for."

And then they really tried to use them in 2020. And maybe it didn't work exactly like the brochure said. And so I see this happening more and more. I think there's always been some reluctance to change. I've always said, waking up and change in ACM -- HCM companies. I don't think that's something people look to do every day. It's kind of like waking up and going to the dentist. So -- but I do think as we move through 2020, it became very obvious to people that you're either winning the game of HCM in your business or you're losing it. And we've identified the way that businesses win. And I think more and more people accept that as what will be the future. And more and more people are motivated to get there now versus waiting too much longer to do that.

A special thank you to all of our employees for an outstanding quarter to finish the year. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2020 results, then I will review some of our notable achievements in 2020 and also discuss our goals for 2021. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.
2020 was a strong year for Paycom. We innovated our sales processes and accelerated our new business sales during the global pandemic. These accomplishments have set the stage for a year of rapid growth that we believe will propel Paycom to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2021. The digital transformation of the human capital management industry has reached a critical stage where the accepted practice of HR and payroll personnel and putting data for employees has come to an end. The industry trend towards self-service has been leading to this point, and I believe the pandemic effectively sealed the faith of the old model. Businesses must shift to provide employees direct access to the database because it's better for the business and the employees. The coming extinction of the old model has been our expectation for many years, and I'm very excited to see it happening.
Our differentiated solution positions Paycom very well to accelerate this trend and deliver long-term sustainable growth. We finished the year with strong results. Our 2020 fourth quarter revenue of $221 million came in very strong, thanks to elevated new business starts in the quarter. Our full year 2020 revenue of $841 million, grew 14% compared to 2019. Paycom maintained an annual revenue retention rate of 93%, even with the pandemic causing some businesses to close and a reduction in employee headcount-related revenue at existing clients.
Our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $331 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. Our focus on the sum of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin has served us well in balancing both growth with profitability, and in 2020, we exceeded our recently stated goal of hitting the Rule of 50. With Q1 of 2021 expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic impacts our numbers from a year-over-year perspective, I believe we have an opportunity to reach the Rule of 60 in 2021.
Our marketing plan throughout 2020 worked very well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year. In 2021, we plan to continue to spend aggressively on advertising to fuel future revenue growth. And continue to expand our roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution that is stronger than ever for companies of all sizes, including companies well above our stated targeted range.
We continue to be pulled well above our stated target range as larger companies look to leverage automated processes for their own employees. At the same time, our small business ads continue to increase in 2020, thanks to the efforts of our expanded inside sales force. Growing employee usage of the Paycom system is generating a substantial return on investment for our clients, their employees and Paycom. High employee usage rates, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange, or DDX, remains strong across our client base.
When combined with high adoption of Manager on-the-Go, these applications are creating new opportunities for product innovation and automation. An example of such automation that we've deployed internally is fully automated payroll. It has been our goal to provide our clients with a better employee transaction interface for payroll. BETI, or B-E-T-I, is that better employee transaction interface. BETI guides individuals through an employee-specific payroll process in which they create and approve their own paycheck.
This means payroll is completed at period end, which has traditionally been the date in which the payroll department gets started. What used to take entire payroll teams days to aggregate is now fully automated and put directly into the employees' hands. This new approach leverages all of our solutions to produce what we call the perfect payroll and eliminates duplicative processes that can create confusion and inaccuracies when employees don't have visibility or control over their own payroll data. This level of employee controls the future of payroll, and I'm looking forward to being able to roll BETI out to the market in 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, our headcount stood at approximately 4,200 employees, up 12% year-over-year as we continue to hire high-quality talent throughout the pandemic to further bolster the foundation of our future growth. While greater than 95% of our employees continue working remotely across the country, we look forward to returning to our offices at some point this year, but only when it's safe to do so.
Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2020. We are in the top 5 ranking in best places to work in the U.S. by Top Workplaces and the #1 spot in Oklahoma. And we were named in the Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing Companies for the fourth consecutive year. These awards are very rewarding and a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture.
Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2020 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Trevon Moehrig of Texas Christian University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be an Oklahoman.
To sum up, we address the 2020 challenges with confident resolve, which enabled our solutions to shine and expose the weaknesses of other disparate systems in the market. The pandemic's impact on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. And while it's unclear if or when those same clients will add to their employee counts, our continued growth relies on remaining focused on the 3 controllable activities that made 2020 so successful. That is providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. Our commitment to investing through the pandemic generated elevated leads and sales. Once we get past Q1 2021, we will have lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and flexibility. As we said throughout 2020, the pandemic didn't build character, it revealed it. I was glad to see we were all who we thought we were. Your efforts have set us up great for 2021.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results with total revenues of $220.9 million, representing growth of roughly 14% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2020 revenue was $841.4 million, representing growth of 14% compared to 2019. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with approximately 31,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 17% compared to 2019.
On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with approximately 16,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 18% compared to 2019. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $216.7 million for the for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 14% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $188.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 85.9%, also up 20 basis points compared to full year 2019. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%.
Adjusted total administrative expenses were $119.1 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $98.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $58.9 million or 26.7% of revenues. We have been very pleased with our marketing strategy throughout 2020, which more than double the demo lead request compared to 2019. And we plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2021.
Adjusted R&D expense was $23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 10.5% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $33.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $25.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted total R&D costs for the full year 2020, including the capitalized portion, were $118.3 million or 14.1% of total revenues compared to $93.3 million or 12.6% of total revenues in the prior year. Even through the pandemic, we aggressively recruited talent in R&D, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development.
Adjusted EBITDA was $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues compared to $78.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 40.6% of total revenues. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues compared to $317.9 million or 43.1% of total revenues in 2019. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share-based on approximately $58 million shares versus $45.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share-based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 33.4%.
For the full year 2020, our GAAP net income was $143.5 million or $2.46 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share-based on approximately 58 million shares versus $50.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2021 to be approximately $26 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $110 million. For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 27% to 28%. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and total debt of $30.9 million related to the construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $52.9 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 433,000 shares for a total of roughly $115 million, including 244,000 shares purchased in the open market. Through December 31, 2020, Paycom has repurchased 4.1 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $423 million, and we currently have $135 million remaining in our buyback program.
Now let me turn to guidance. With the continued stabilization of our current client revenue base, we are pleased to be able to provide Q1 and full year guidance that is consistent with our historical guidance approach of guiding to what we can see as of today. As a reminder, the effect on our current client revenue of lower headcount at our pre-pandemic clients continues to represent a loss of approximately $1.9 million to $2 million in weekly recurring revenue. The impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March of 2020, represents an additional loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue.
Also, the first quarter benefits from form filing revenue related to employee tax forms for payrolls run in 2020. We estimate that in Q1 2021, there will be fewer forms filed than normally would have been filed by our client base as a result of fewer employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries. Fewer forms filed represents a roughly $6 million to $7 million headwind to Q1 2021 recurring revenue.
With these factors in mind, our full year and first quarter 2021 guidance is as follows: for the fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion or approximately 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $396 million to $398 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.3% at the midpoint of the range.
For the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $270 million to $272 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 12% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $126 million to $128 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. Q1 2021 is expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic will impact our year-over-year comparisons. After that, our achievement should be more reflective of the strong fundamental growth our business can generate.
With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

So you're still low on the small business. But in fact, we did accelerate that this year. And I would have expected our average amount per client to drop a little bit.
Based on that, what we actually saw is you're taking about 10% out, let's call it, just on client employees that you can already calculate through our revenue. So you've already got that hit. And then the fact that we're selling small business clients. I was a little surprised to see that our average per client held very close to the same. It had been growing for the last several years. But even with the COVID hit we took on our numbers, that average stayed really close to the same. And that came from us continuing to have success selling downmarket. But also, we're having a lot of success continuing to sell upmarket and continue to be pulled further up. And so those are starting to average each other out.

And so you have to be in line with what product fees are. But really, it's an ROI-driven strategy. And so we would expect people to uptake our product that want a differentiated strategy with a different ROI. I mean we just talked about how we're going to be providing -- our products are going to be doing full-service payroll in the future. I mean employees are going to be doing their own payroll. And we're starting with that right now internally. We've produced a better employee transaction interface through BETI. And we're going to be rolling that out throughout the year.
And so just as employees are used to applying for jobs online. They're used to doing their banking online. They're just -- they're used to doing their shopping online. We're going to be bringing that to the payroll business. I mean it just doesn't make sense that we're not already there to be quite honest with you. It's how businesses win.

I mean if you're with Paycom, you could save 100,000 different key strokes. Some of our clients save millions of key strokes every month.
So that's where it's going. I don't see us -- I don't see the market moving away from that. So all that's to say is I believe in order for people to compete with us that the value proposition is going to be more -- is going to have to more match the value proposition that we're delivering.

Whether you're an employee and you work for a 25,000-employee company or whether you're an employee and you work for a 500-employee company, you really dislike manual processes that really become time suckers out of your day. And so all employees would prefer to use something that's extremely easy to use, comprehensive and has quite a bit of consistency. And so -- and that's also better for the employer. 
And so I think that large businesses in the enterprise level have been trying very hard for a long time to provide a single type solution to their employees because they do realize the importance of that. They've just done it through integration. And we do have a product that works for what they're trying to accomplish that's incredibly scalable. And so I do see us continuing to go upmarket as we're pulled, and I see us continuing to stay focused on the mid-market. And then as we get leads below 50, we'll continue to sell them as well. But regardless of what size company you work for, you're still the same in person and you're still the same employee and you value things of ease when it comes to task management and HCM.
So all that's to say is enterprise products are overcomplicating the situation for the employee. And a lot of you guys on the call, you know that. You work for companies with large organizations and it's kind of a mess you have to work with in technology. It's oftentimes an 8-legged octopus with no head. So we're fixing that problem in mid-market, and I see us doing the same as we continue to be pulled upmarket."

And so the more full solution sets we're able to deploy, the stronger value proposition or higher the ROI the client is going to be able to achieve. Again, it's not purchasing the products that produces the ROI, it's using the products that produces the ROI. And as we move to more self-service initiatives, which we're already there, we're going to be measuring that for a client, which we believe drives a greater overall usage of the entire product."

And so again, it wouldn't be uncommon for a restaurant that might have 250 employees, you could see 450 or 500 W-2s on that in a full year.
And in this type of year, for someone that may have had 250 employees, we may have only seen 275 W-2s because of kind of when it happened and then we lack some growth on that. And so that's how it's calculated in expectation of what normally happens with our W-2s as it corresponds to the business that we have and their number of employees and then what didn't happen this year in regards to that.

Throughout the year, we'll be rolling BETI out. And at some point, it will be not only an upsell to current clients. It will be what we sell as we go to market, that will be the way to do payroll. We came out with employee self-service in 2002. It w",696,"Sure. Throughout the year, we'll be rolling BETI out. And at some point, it will be not only an upsell to current clients. It will be what we sell as we go to market, that will be the way to do payroll. We came out with employee self-service in 2002. It was free, and I couldn't even hardly get anybody to look at the product for 2 years. A matter of fact, I wasn't even until we developed time and attendance online that people started using employee self-service to clock in at time and attendance.
And so as we look at this today, I do believe BETI is kind of the cherry on the top of the payroll cake. Even internally here, we've returned over 80% of our hours back to our own payroll department just because of the way we do things now. BETI has you doing the payroll throughout versus waiting to pay period end. So what does that do? Well, it makes it a lot more efficient for every employee as well as there's a lot of work now on the payroll side they're just not doing. And then you think of all the after-the-fact corrections, manuals, voids, things that were missed, basically that becomes liability and exposure to the business, which is all going away.
And so this is going to happen. Just as nobody gets up from their chair and goes and changes their channel on their TV, and we can all remember the days those that happened, that's what's going to happen here. Employees are going to do their own payroll, and they're going to do their own payroll because that's the easiest way for them to do it. And they're going to do their own payroll because that's how business wins. And a matter of fact, that's the only way business can win at payroll. And so that's what we're driving at.
In answer to your question, we're using it internally right now. I would expect in second quarter, we'll have our first clients on it. And then third and fourth quarter, I would see us really starting to roll it out as we move those usage patterns and really move the way people start thinking about payroll. Instead of starting payroll when the period ends, you start it when it begins and the payroll is over when pay period ends. So that's what we're driving at. I believe it's the most significant product that we've ever developed at Paycom to be quite honest with you because it fully automates a very complicated task that there's little to 0 room actually for inaccuracies.
Payroll has got to be perfect. If you're 99.99% accurate in payroll, you get an F. Employees expect it to be perfect. They expect it to be in their bank account, and they're not even really going to thank you for it. It's an expectation for the work they're doing. And so we're going to make sure that happens. And we're going to put that responsibility as well as confirmation ability in the hands of the employees, which is where it's already at right now. Nobody other than an employee themselves knows if they got paid everything that they should have been paid. And it's best to have them confirm that and be a part of that transaction.
So that's what we're going to do, and I would see us rolling this out throughout the year. As far as when does it become popular, when does it become the thing? Like I said, took us a while to get people to use employee self-service when we first came out with it. I don't think this is going to take as long as that because we've been really focused on the usage patterns that drives us toward this, and we're real close to being there now. So you're going to have those early adopters, then you're going to have the middle group, and then we'll have everybody else after that, and we'll just kind of have to see how long that takes.

Now we did see, again, the spike, how it impacted us in that March, April and May time period where things got really bad and then kind of started to stabilize. But throughout the year, a different spike in cases didn't impact our ability to sell and move products. Now that we've returned to guidance, I believe that our strong sales bookings are included in our guidance as well as our performance.
So I'm not going to keep talking about bookings. But what I would say is this that, when we got into March and especially towards the end of March, I didn't have an expectation that 2020 would necessarily be a record for bookings and starts, it was. And as we turn into 2021, when you're looking at our guidance and you're looking at the things that we have accomplished through the year, I believe we're going to need that also in 2021, which not -- is not unlike any other year we've had in the past, where we've always needed record sales and as well as record starts to hit our numbers and accomplish our goals.

I'm pretty sure that both employees and HR departments as well as the C-suite alike, agree that removing middle layers of a data transfer process is the most efficient way to do it. And I think throughout 2020, you saw frustrations rise on both the side of the people doing the input as well as on the side of the employees that lacked access. And then also, you kind of had to rush to deploy products. I think 2021 was the year that people dusted off products that they really thought were -- they bought for a certain situation. And then they really tried to use them in 2020. And maybe it didn't work exactly like the brochure said.
And so I see this happening more and more. I think there's always been some reluctance to change. I've always said, waking up and change in ACM -- HCM companies. I don't think that's something people look to do every day. It's kind of like waking up and going to the dentist. So -- but I do think as we move through 2020, it became very obvious to people that you're either winning the game of HCM in your business or you're losing it. And we've identified the way that businesses win. And I think more and more people accept that as what will be the future. And more and more people are motivated to get there now versus waiting too much longer to do that. And so we'll continue to drive that so that businesses can have a clear ROI and a good choice for HCM."

I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our first quarter 2021 results, then I'll review the progress we are making on our goals for 2021. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
But first, I want to thank my colleague and good brand, Jeff York, for his many years of service, leading our sales organization over the last 14 years. Jeff has built a sustainable sales organization with a deep bench of like-minded professionals. I look forward to continuing to work with him in his strategic leadership role. 
One of those like-minded individuals is our new Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot. Holly is a true success story at Paycom. Her 14-year career with us began with an internship in the sales organization. Holly quickly progressed into a top sales rep, a top sales manager and a top regional sales manager earning many of the company's highest sales ranking awards along the way. In 2016, she was asked to further expand Paycom's Client Relations department, which presents additional products to clients and focuses on creating value by increasing employee usage. Holly has been instrumental in contributing to the success of Paycom across the entire sales organization, and I'm confident she will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing. 
We delivered strong first quarter results, even with a tough pre-COVID year-over-year comparison. Our 2021 first quarter revenue of $272.2 million grew 12.3% compared to the prior year period, and came in above the top end of our guidance range despite several previously identified headwinds. Unsurprisingly, the first quarter revenue was impacted by lower forms, filings and adjustments due to lower hiring trends in industries, most impacted by the pandemic in 2020. 
Excluding forms, filings and adjustments revenue, our year-over-year recurring revenue growth accelerated again in Q1. As we go through 2021, we will have a cleaner comparison that will provide a true reflection of our revenue growth profile since the arrival of the pandemic. 
Turning to profitability. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.9%. As reflected in our updated guidance, which Craig will discuss, we believe the combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin makes us well positioned to exceed the Rule of 60 in 2021. 
Our marketing plan continues to work very well, delivering strong demo leads in the first quarter. We continue to see success from our advertising spend, and we intend to continue to spend aggressively to fuel future revenue growth and expand a roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition, the Paycom single database solution that is stronger than ever. Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. In fact, in a recent survey, we commissioned with the third party, employees expressed frustration with complex and disparate HR software that lack the transparency and usability they've come to expect from consumer-oriented technologies. Paycom's employee usage strategy and single database solutions squarely addresses these expectations. 
We had record high employee usage rates in Q1, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. This is fueling new opportunities for product innovation and automation for products like BETI, our better employee transaction interface for payroll, which we started rolling out to a select few clients during the quarter. BETI is already receiving high marks as it transforms the way payroll is done. I believe over the next 12 to 18 months, BETI will become the standard for how payroll should be done. 
Now that the first quarter is over, we have substantially lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. New client additions are driving our growth in Q2 and beyond. The negative revenue impact that pandemic had on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. While we haven't seen any material improvement in employment trends at those same clients, our forecast and future growth initiatives are not dependent on any improvement. Our strategy about the pandemic has remained unchanged. We will continue to focus on the 3 controllable activities of providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We've done a great job and succeeded in these areas, which has kept us on-track to achieve our growth initiatives. I'd like to thank our employees for their patience, flexibility and grid over these last 14 months. 
In summary, now that we've lapped Q1's tough year-over-year comparison the last pre-COVID quarter, we expect that the strength of our growth profile will be reflected in our future results. The record new business revenue and record number of new clients added in 2020, combined with robust first quarter sales, is bolstering our long-term revenue growth opportunity. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM, so we have a long runway ahead of us. Our strategy is working, and our products have never been more relevant. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

As Chad mentioned, we are pleased",879,"Before I review our first quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of $272.2 million representing growth of roughly 12% over the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the first quarter. 
Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $267.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 12% from the comparable prior year period. As expected, the effects of lower headcount on our pre-pandemic clients and the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March of 2020 remained relatively unchanged. 
In addition, as we discussed on our Q4 2020 earnings call, your employees working in industry's hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries resulted in fewer annual forms, filings and adjustments. It is difficult for us to estimate the exact amount that those trends impacted us, but we don't believe it was dramatically different from our expectations. 
Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $236.9 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 87%. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $118.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $59.3 million or 21.8% of revenues. We continue to be very pleased with our marketing strategy with another quarter of very strong demo leads, and we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 8.5% of total revenue. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $34 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $27.6 million in the prior year period. We have been aggressively recruiting talent in R&D to drive our future growth through innovation and new product development. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 48.9% of total revenues compared to $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues. We benefited from cost efficiencies in G&A, which we expect to continue throughout the year. We plan to continue to invest in the marketing and R&D. 
Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $85.9 million or $1.47 per diluted share versus $77.9 million or $1.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2021 to be approximately $27 million to $28 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $105 million to $110 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $215.1 million and total debt of $30.5 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $89.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. 
Shifting to guidance. We have now substantially lapped the last pre-COVID year-over-year comparison, and our guidance for strong second quarter revenue growth represents a true reflection of the strong performance we achieved throughout 2020. We are pleased to be able to provide the following Q2 and full year guidance. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $231 million to $233 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $80 million to $82 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion, up from $1.009 billion to [ $1.11 ] billion, or approximately 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $402 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately [ 39.4% ] at the midpoint of the range. 
To conclude, our strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and grow the business has been working. And we will continue to focus on providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a profitable recurring business model and a long runway to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth.

So I guess, first, I would say, as you know, Q1 is typically one of our largest quarters for revenue in any given calendar year. And that's because of our annualized revenue billings of forms, filings and adjustments that come in throughout the year, which have to do with hiring and turnover trends throughout the year at different businesses. Well, 2020 reacted differently than any other year since I've been doing this since 1998, which the hiring trends were different. It would be traditionally a restaurant that may have 100 employees could easily do 300 W-2s with forms, filings and what have you. This year, that same-restaurant may do $120 million W-2. So we saw significant differences in hiring trends throughout 2020 than what we had seen in the past. We did try to estimate what those would be. 
Also, as a reminder, this Q1, we are still lapping Q1 of a previous year that did not have COVID in it, which made for a tougher comps. And as we move through second quarter, we've substantially lapped the pandemic. Now you did still have recurring revenue still getting worse throughout the month of April, as we had mentioned that -- it kind of got to its worst point beginning in May and then started to stabilize. But we are excited about our next quarter guide. The guide that we're putting in Q2 of this year is the largest Q2 guide we've had since 2017 on a percentage basis for revenue growth.

I mean, BETI is really an all or nothing type usage product. I mean, you do have to change your internal process in order to use BETI because like we've said in the past, payrolls are traditionally started after pay period end. And BETI contemplates all that happening at payroll beginning to where once pay period ends, the payroll is done. And so we have had clients already submit using BETI and their employees are actually able to use BETI. As a matter of fact, one, within the first hour of release. We had like 65% employee approvals and by time of submission, they were over 85%. So employees are already engaging in it. We're getting feedback from employees that this is the first time I've really looked at my check and much less understood it. So we're having a lot of positive there. 
We expect to put on at least 100 more clients in the next couple of months on BETI and then throughout the year, we'll continue to convert all over. And what I mean by convert, it's not a conversion of debt. It's more a conversion of their internal process and how you approach each payroll a little bit differently. 
In our own environment, we've gone from over 55 clicks or processes within a payroll down to 3. Each person's experience is going to be differently depending on whether you're doing commissions, bonuses, labor distribution, job costing. So it is a little bit different for each company, but it does drive a lot of efficiencies. And as those payroll administrators submit payroll, they have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracies that have already been approved by those employees. 
So it's going very well now as far as billing. BETI is not going to be bill unlike many of our other modules. It will be a per life per employee fee to use BETI. And then as we move throughout this year, we'll continue to sell more and more clients on its value."

I mean, I think that we can aid people in that. So I also think you're really seeing a shift toward the employee user. I don't know that 4 years ago, you could even point to many employee users, especially in the mid-market. And today, that's really becoming the standard. And so I think there are a lot of business that are focused on leveraging employee usage trends of what they use in their daily lives working with consumer products. I think there's a lot of businesses looking to leverage that to create value for themselves, so as businesses come back. 
And I'm not saying that we're not seeing positive hiring trends. My comments are related to those clients that presented the $1.85 million to $2 million weekly impact. We're not seeing those numbers move dramatically. Are we seeing impacts of businesses starting to come back and hotels starting to hire more and what have you? We're seeing some of that and where we can see that is in our talent acquisition as more requisitions as are open, is in our background checks. So I do think things are getting better, but the question was more related to, how are those clients that were impacted, those clients that we said had that monthly negative rate or excuse me, monthly weekly negative revenue impact of $1.90 million to $2 million. I think about a quarter or so ago, we called out, it may have improved $100,000 a week ISH. It kind of fluctuated week to week. And then now we've said -- we haven't seen any substantial sustaining change from that, which would be accurate as we sit here today. 
But we are bullish about employee trends beginning to get better for us. It's never something that we've been able to focus on layer hat on that or bet the farm on that, you've got to really do the work.

So I don't see us going backwards in regards to that. Plus I really -- it's something that was happening anyway. I mean, it wasn't that the pandemic created these opportunities. I think the pandemic more sealed the fate of the old way. In fact, we were already seeing trends with employees that are used to using consumer-based technology to do banking, get a plane ticket, order a coffee and then they came to work, and it was 1992 through e-mail and what have you. And so we're already seeing the trends of that usage happening. I think the pandemic just provided a strong proof source for. The reason for that, it probably accelerated that for some people.

And so by moving the process up to the beginning of the pay period versus at the end of the pay period. It's going to change the way people do that payroll. As far as the win rate, do I think it's going to impact our win rate? Absolutely, once people really start using it. The DDX we came out with, it started impacting our retention not long after we came out with it. And Manager on-the-Go, I would say, is a similar product as that.

I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our first quarter 2021 results, then I'll review the progress we are making on our goals for 2021. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
But first, I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Jeff York, for his many years of service leading our sales organization over the last 14 years. Jeff has built a sustainable sales organization with a deep bench of like-minded professionals. I look forward to continuing to work with him in his strategic leadership role. 
One of those like-minded individuals is our new Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot. Holly is a true success story at Paycom. Her 14-year career with us began with an internship in the sales organization. Holly quickly progressed into a top sales rep, a top sales manager and a top regional sales manager earning many of the company's highest sales ranking awards along the way. In 2016, she was asked to further expand Paycom's Client Relations department, which presents additional products to clients and focuses on creating value by increasing employee usage. Holly has been instrumental in contributing to the success of Paycom across the entire sales organization, and I'm confident she will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing. 
We delivered strong first quarter results, even with a tough pre-COVID year-over-year comparison. Our 2021 first quarter revenue of $272.2 million grew 12.3% compared to the prior year period, and came in above the top end of our guidance range despite several previously identified headwinds. Unsurprisingly, the first quarter revenue was impacted by lower forms, filings and adjustments due to lower hiring trends in industries most impacted by the pandemic in 2020. 
Excluding forms, filings and adjustments revenue, our year-over-year recurring revenue growth accelerated again in Q1. As we go through 2021, we will have a cleaner comparison that will provide a truer reflection of our revenue growth profile since the arrival of the pandemic. 
Turning to profitability. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.9%. As reflected in our updated guidance, which Craig will discuss, we believe the combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin makes us well positioned to exceed the Rule of 60 in 2021. 
Our marketing plan continues to work very well, delivering strong demo leads in the first quarter. We continue to see success from our advertising spend, and we intend to continue to spend aggressively to fuel future revenue growth and expand a roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition, the Paycom single database solution that is stronger than ever. Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. In fact, in a recent survey we commissioned with a third party, employees expressed frustration with complex and disparate HR software that lack the transparency and usability they've come to expect from consumer-oriented technologies. Paycom's employee usage strategy and single database solutions squarely addresses these expectations. 
We had record high employee usage rates in Q1, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. This is fueling new opportunities for product innovation and automation for products like BETI, our better employee transaction interface for payroll, which we started rolling out to a select few clients during the quarter. BETI is already receiving high marks as it transforms the way payroll is done. I believe over the next 12 to 18 months, BETI will become the standard for how payroll should be done. 
Now that the first quarter is over, we have substantially lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. New client additions are driving our growth in Q2 and beyond. The negative revenue impact the pandemic had on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. While we haven't seen any material improvement in employment trends at those same clients, our forecast and future growth initiatives are not dependent on any improvement. Our strategy throughout the pandemic has remained unchanged. We will continue to focus on the 3 controllable activities of providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We've done a great job and succeeded in these areas, which has kept us on track to achieve our growth initiatives. I'd like to thank our employees for their patience, flexibility and grit over these last 14 months.
In summary, now that we've lapped Q1's tough year-over-year comparison with the last pre-COVID quarter, we expect that the strength of our growth profile will be reflected in our future results. The record new business revenue and record number of new clients added in 2020, combined with robust first quarter sales, is bolstering our long-term revenue growth opportunity. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM, so we have a long runway ahead of us. Our strategy is working, and our products have never been more relevant. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"
254225545,711198885,2269344,"Paycom Software, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Paycom Software, Inc.","Executives","Before I review our first quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.

As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of $272.2 million representing growth of roughly 12% over the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the first quarter. 
Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $267.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 12% from the comparable prior year period. As expected, the effects of lower headcount on our pre-pandemic clients and the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March 2020 remained relatively unchanged. 
In addition, as we discussed on our Q4 2020 earnings call, your employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries resulted in fewer annual forms, filings and adjustments. It is difficult for us to estimate the exact amount that those trends impacted us, but we don't believe it was dramatically different from our expectations. 
Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $236.9 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 87%. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $118.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $59.3 million or 21.8% of revenues. We continue to be very pleased with our marketing strategy with another quarter of very strong demo leads, and we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 8.5% of total revenue. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $34 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $27.6 million in the prior year period. We have been aggressively recruiting talent in R&D to drive our future growth through innovation and new product development. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 48.9% of total revenues compared to $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues. We benefited from cost efficiencies in G&A, which we expect to continue throughout the year. We plan to continue to invest in the marketing and R&D. 
Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $85.9 million or $1.47 per diluted share versus $77.9 million or $1.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2021 to be approximately $27 million to $28 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $105 million to $110 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $215.1 million and total debt of $30.5 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $89.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. 
Shifting to guidance. We have now substantially lapped the last pre-COVID year-over-year comparison, and our guidance for strong second quarter revenue growth represents a true reflection of the strong performance we achieved throughout 2020. We are pleased to be able to provide the following Q2 and full year guidance. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $231 million to $233 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $80 million to $82 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion, up from $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion, or approximately 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $402 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.4% at the midpoint of the range. 
To conclude, our strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and grow the business has been working. And we will continue to focus on providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a profitable recurring business model and a long runway to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth.

So I guess, first, I would say, as you know, Q1 is typically one of our largest quarters for revenue in any given calendar year. And that's because of our annualized revenue billings of forms, filings and adjustments that come in throughout the year, which have to do with hiring and turnover trends throughout the year at different businesses. Well, 2020 reacted differently than any other year since I've been doing this since 1998, in which the hiring trends were different. It would be traditionally a restaurant that may have 100 employees could easily do 300 W-2s with forms, filings and what have you. This year, that same-restaurant may do 120 W-2. So we saw significant differences in hiring trends throughout 2020 than what we had seen in the past. We did try to estimate what those would be. 
Also, as a reminder, this Q1, we are still lapping Q1 of a previous year that did not have COVID in it, which made for tougher comps. And as we move through second quarter, we've substantially lapped the pandemic. Now you did still have recurring revenue still getting worse throughout the month of April, as we had mentioned that -- it kind of got to its worst point beginning in May and then started to stabilize. But we are excited about our next quarter guide. The guide that we're putting forth in Q2 of this year is the largest Q2 guide we've had since 2017 on a percentage basis for revenue growth. So you weren't necessarily wrong in your early take that we're getting back on the right track or [Foreign Language], Raimo, as you might say in your native language."

I mean you do have to change your internal process in order to use BETI because like we've said in the past, payrolls are traditionally started after pay period end. And BETI contemplates all that happening at payroll beginning to where once pay period ends, the payroll is done. And so we have had clients already submit using BETI and their employees are actually able to use BETI. As a matter of fact, one, within the first hour of release, we had like 65% employee approvals and by time of submission, they were over 85%. So employees are already engaging in it. We're getting feedback from employees that this is the first time I've really looked at my check and -- much less understood it. So we're having a lot of positive there. 
We expect to put on at least 100 more clients in the next couple of months on BETI and then throughout the year, we'll continue to convert all over. And what I mean by convert, it's not a conversion of debt. It's more a conversion of their internal process and how you approach each payroll a little bit differently.
In our own environment, we've gone from over 55 clicks or processes within a payroll down to 3. Each person's experience is going to be differently depending on whether you're doing commissions, bonuses, labor distribution, job costing. So it is a little bit different for each company, but it does drive a lot of efficiencies. And as those payroll administrators submit payroll, they have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracies that have already been approved by those employees. 
So it's going very well now. As far as billing, BETI is not going to be billed unlike many of our other modules. It will be a per like per employee fee to use BETI. And then as we move throughout this year, we'll continue to sell more and more clients on its value."

We changed about 3 or 4 years ago to really focus on employee usage as an organization. We focused on selling usage. We'd come out with the DDX, then we came out with Manager On-The-Go, now BETI. So obviously, as we settle into this year, there are some changes that we make to our selling motion, but that's not unlike what we've done in any given year. 
Holly was -- she was our first intern on the sales side. And actually, she started interning for us when I was the sales manager. So Holly has a deep knowledge of what we've been doing this entire time. She's helped us build it up to now. And the reason why Holly was chosen is it allows us to continue to increase the drive that we have throughout our sales organization with a consistent leader with also a consistent talk track that we've been driving throughout the sales organization for the last 20 years. So I wouldn't see any significant changes happening to the sales other than what we always have, which is improvements on our strategies as we deliver more value to the client."

It gets harder to exactly -- put an exact number on how those negative trends impacted us. We did a pretty good job of estimating that. But -- and we don't necessarily guide to have a certain level of beat. We guide to what we can see and oftentimes with new business revenue, that can be impacted one way or the other. 
And as it relates to first quarter, though, we've always been heavy on annual forms, filings, adjustments. And so -- and also to note that it's not just our W-2 forms with us. We also have ACA forms at the end of every year as well. So I think we did a pretty good job estimating its impact. Obviously, the fact that we continue to grow throughout the quarter, and we're coming out strong into Q2, reflects that we did have strong adds throughout Q1 and coming out of Q4.

I mean I think we're in a business where we make those departments more efficient. And so to the fact that you need to go hire many people using our onboarding product, using our applicant tracking or talent acquisition product, using our background checks products that we have out there. I mean I think that we can aid people in that. So I also think you're really seeing a shift toward the employee user. I don't know that 4 years ago, you could even point to many employee users, especially in the mid-market. And today, that's really becoming the standard. And so I think there are a lot of business that are focused on leveraging employee usage trends of what they use in their daily lives working with consumer products. I think there's a lot of businesses looking to leverage that to create value for themselves. 
So as businesses come back -- and I'm not saying that we're not seeing positive hiring trends. My comments are related to those clients that represented the $1.85 million to $2 million weekly impact. We're not seeing those numbers move dramatically. Are we seeing impacts of businesses starting to come back and hotels starting to hire more and what have you? We're seeing some of that and where we can see that is in our talent acquisition as more requisitions are open, is in our background checks. So I do think things are getting better, but the question was more related to, how are those clients that were impacted, those clients that we said had that monthly negative rate -- or excuse me, monthly weekly negative revenue impact of $1.90 million to $2 million. I think about a quarter or so ago, we called out, it may have improved $100,000 a week-ish. It kind of fluctuated week to week. And then now we've said -- we haven't seen any substantial sustainable change from that, which would be accurate as we sit here today. 
But we are bullish about employee trends beginning to get better for us. It's never something that we've been able to focus on, lay our hat on that or bet the farm on that, you've got to really do the work. And what we are doing, we are going out, and we are selling businesses right now. And if they have 415 employees, then we're selling them at that, and we're bringing them on. Now maybe they grow, maybe they don't. But we've just been focused on adding new business into -- onto our platform, and that's worked well for us."

As we talked about during the pandemic, every office was substantially open because our people could really sell a prospect anywhere. Prior to the pandemic, it was all in person. So if we needed to -- if we wanted to sell a deal in Las Vegas, we don't have an office in Las Vegas. We had to fly someone there and go there in person. During the pandemic, we were able to do that virtually. And so as we shift back, there will be offices that we'll be looking to open. And then we'll have to do it in the right time as well because I'm not 100% sure when we will be going to full in-office selling again if ever from that perspective as it relates to the mid-market.

And what that does is it eliminates manuals, voids, adjustments, all the things that payroll departments and accounting departments traditionally have to do after the fact once they found out that, that check wasn't -- didn't exactly include everything that it should have for that employee. 
And so by moving the process up to the beginning of the pay period versus at the end of the pay period, it's going to change the way people do that payroll. 
As far as the win rate, do I think it's going to impact our win rate? Absolutely, once people really start using it. The DDX we came out with, it started impacting our retention not long after we came out with it. And Manager on-the-Go, I would say, is a similar product as that. And all of that got more and more people engaged, employees, again, engaged in our software and interacting with the database on their own. And the more people that interact with the database on their own, the more accurate the data is, the more confirmation that you have that the data is accurate, and it produces less liability and exposure for the businesses that deploy it.

I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our first quarter 2021 results, then I'll review the progress we are making on our goals for 2021. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
But first, I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Jeff York, for his many years of service leading our sales organization over the last 14 years. Jeff has built a sustainable sales organization with a deep bench of like-minded professionals. I look forward to continuing to work with him in his strategic leadership role. 
One of those like-minded individuals is our new Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot. Holly is a true success story at Paycom. Her 14-year career with us began with an internship in the sales organization. Holly quickly progressed into a top sales rep, a top sales manager and a top regional sales manager, earning many of the company's highest sales ranking awards along the way. In 2016, she was asked to further expand Paycom's Client Relations department, which presents additional products to clients and focuses on creating value by increasing employee usage. Holly has been instrumental in contributing to the success of Paycom across the entire sales organization, and I'm confident she will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing. 
We delivered strong first quarter results, even with a tough pre-COVID year-over-year comparison. Our 2021 first quarter revenue of $272.2 million grew 12.3% compared to the prior year period, and came in above the top end of our guidance range despite several previously identified headwinds. Unsurprisingly, the first quarter revenue was impacted by lower forms, filings and adjustments due to lower hiring trends in industries most impacted by the pandemic in 2020. 
Excluding forms, filings and adjustments revenue, our year-over-year recurring revenue growth accelerated again in Q1. As we go through 2021, we will have a cleaner comparison that will provide a truer reflection of our revenue growth profile since the arrival of the pandemic. 
Turning to profitability. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.9%. As reflected in our updated guidance, which Craig will discuss, we believe the combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin makes us well positioned to exceed the Rule of 60 in 2021. 
Our marketing plan continues to work very well, delivering strong demo leads in the first quarter. We continue to see success from our advertising spend, and we intend to continue to spend aggressively to fuel future revenue growth and expand a roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition, the Paycom single database solution that is stronger than ever. Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. In fact, in a recent survey we commissioned with a third party, employees expressed frustration with complex and disparate HR software that lack the transparency and usability they've come to expect from consumer-oriented technologies. Paycom's employee usage strategy and single database solutions squarely addresses these expectations. 
We had record high employee usage rates in Q1, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. This is fueling new opportunities for product innovation and automation for products like BETI, our better employee transaction interface for payroll, which we started rolling out to a select few clients during the quarter. BETI is already receiving high marks as it transforms the way payroll is done. I believe over the next 12 to 18 months, BETI will become the standard for how payroll should be done. 
Now that the first quarter is over, we have substantially lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. New client additions are driving our growth in Q2 and beyond. The negative revenue impact the pandemic had on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. While we haven't seen any material improvement in employment trends at those same clients, our forecast and future growth initiatives are not dependent on any improvement. Our strategy throughout the pandemic has remained unchanged. We will continue to focus on the 3 controllable activities of providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We've done a great job and succeeded in these areas, which has kept us on track to achieve our growth initiatives. I'd like to thank our employees for their patience, flexibility and grit over these last 14 months.
In summary, now that we've lapped Q1's tough year-over-year comparison with the last pre-COVID quarter, we expect that the strength of our growth profile will be reflected in our future results. The record new business revenue and record number of new clients added in 2020, combined with robust first quarter sales, is bolstering our long-term revenue growth opportunity. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM, so we have a long runway ahead of us. Our strategy is working, and our products have never been more relevant. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of $272.2 million representing growth of roughly 12% over the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the first quarter. 
Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $267.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 12% from the comparable prior year period. As expected, the effects of lower headcount on our pre-pandemic clients and the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March 2020 remained relatively unchanged. 
In addition, as we discussed on our Q4 2020 earnings call, fewer employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries resulted in fewer annual forms, filings and adjustments. It is difficult for us to estimate the exact amount that those trends impacted us, but we don't believe it was dramatically different from our expectations. 
Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $236.9 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 87%. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $118.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $59.3 million or 21.8% of revenues. We continue to be very pleased with our marketing strategy with another quarter of very strong demo leads, and we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 8.5% of total revenue. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $34 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $27.6 million in the prior year period. We have been aggressively recruiting talent in R&D to drive our future growth through innovation and new product development. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 48.9% of total revenues compared to $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues. We benefited from cost efficiencies in G&A, which we expect to continue throughout the year. We plan to continue to invest into marketing and R&D. 
Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $85.9 million or $1.47 per diluted share versus $77.9 million or $1.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2021 to be approximately $27 million to $28 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $105 million to $110 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $215.1 million and total debt of $30.5 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $89.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. 
Shifting to guidance. We have now substantially lapped the last pre-COVID year-over-year comparison, and our guidance for strong second quarter revenue growth represents a true reflection of the strong performance we achieved throughout 2020. We are pleased to be able to provide the following Q2 and full year guidance. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $231 million to $233 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $80 million to $82 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion, up from $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion, or approximately 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $402 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.4% at the midpoint of the range. 
To conclude, our strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and grow the business has been working. And we will continue to focus on providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a profitable recurring business model and a long runway to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth.

So I guess, first, I would say, as you know, Q1 is typically one of our largest quarters for revenue in any given calendar year. And that's because of our annualized revenue billings of forms, filings and adjustments that come in throughout the year, which have to do with hiring and turnover trends throughout the year at different businesses. Well, 2020 reacted differently than any other year since I've been doing this since 1998, in which the hiring trends were different. It would be traditionally a restaurant that may have 100 employees could easily do 300 W-2s with forms, filings and what have you. This year, that same-restaurant may do 120 W-2s. So we saw significant differences in hiring trends throughout 2020 than what we had seen in the past. We did try to estimate what those would be. 
Also, as a reminder, this Q1, we are still lapping Q1 of a previous year that did not have COVID in it, which made for tougher comps. And as we move through second quarter, we've substantially lapped the pandemic. Now you did still have recurring revenue still getting worse throughout the month of April, as we had mentioned that -- it kind of got to its worst point beginning in May and then started to stabilize. But we are excited about our next quarter guide. The guide that we're putting forth in Q2 of this year is the largest Q2 guide we've had since 2017 on a percentage basis for revenue growth. So you weren't necessarily wrong in your early take that we're getting back on the right track or [Foreign Language], Raimo, as you might say in your native language."

I mean you do have to change your internal process in order to use BETI because like we've said in the past, payrolls are traditionally started after pay period end. And BETI contemplates all that happening at payroll beginning to where once pay period ends, the payroll is done. And so we have had clients already submit using BETI and their employees are actually able to use BETI. As a matter of fact, one, within the first hour of release, we had like 65% employee approvals and by time of submission, they were over 85%. So employees are already engaging in it. We're getting feedback from employees that this is the first time I've really looked at my check and -- much less understood it. So we're having a lot of positive there. 
We expect to put on at least 100 more clients in the next couple of months on BETI and then throughout the year, we'll continue to convert all over. And what I mean by convert, it's not a conversion of [ debt. ] It's more a conversion of their internal process and how you approach each payroll a little bit differently.
In our own environment, we've gone from over 55 clicks or processes within a payroll down to 3. Each person's experience is going to be differently depending on whether you're doing commissions, bonuses, labor distribution, job costing. So it is a little bit different for each company, but it does drive a lot of efficiencies. And as those payroll administrators submit payroll, they have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracies that have already been approved by those employees. 
So it's going very well now. As far as billing, BETI is not going to be billed unlike many of our other modules. It will be a per like per employee fee to use BETI. And then as we move throughout this year, we'll continue to sell more and more clients on its value."

And so to the fact that you need to go hire many people using our onboarding product, using our applicant tracking or talent acquisition product, using our background checks products that we have out there. I mean I think that we can aid people in that. So I also think you're really seeing a shift toward the employee user. I don't know that 4 years ago, you could even point to many employee users, especially in the mid-market. And today, that's really becoming the standard. And so I think there are a lot of business that are focused on leveraging employee usage trends of what they use in their daily lives working with consumer products. I think there's a lot of businesses looking to leverage that to create value for themselves. 
So as businesses come back -- and I'm not saying that we're not seeing positive hiring trends. My comments are related to those clients that represented the $1.85 million to $2 million weekly impact. We're not seeing those numbers move dramatically. Are we seeing impacts of businesses starting to come back and hotels starting to hire more and what have you? We're seeing some of that and where we can see that is in our talent acquisition as more requisitions are open, is in our background checks. So I do think things are getting better, but the question was more related to, how are those clients that were impacted, those clients that we said had that monthly negative rate -- or excuse me, monthly weekly negative revenue impact of $1.90 million to $2 million. I think about a quarter or so ago, we called out, it may have improved $100,000 a week-ish. It kind of fluctuated week to week. And then now we've said -- we haven't seen any substantial sustainable change from that, which would be accurate as we sit here today. 
But we are bullish about employee trends beginning to get better for us. It's never something that we've been able to focus on, lay our hat on that or bet the farm on that, you've got to really do the work.

And so that's been getting better and better as we've gone throughout the, I would say, I think we've had the DDX for the last 18, 19 months. We had Manager on-the-Go now for well over a year. And so we continue to see those trends tick up. Now is that in anticipation for BETI? Or is that because of the value someone's receiving by using those things independently, whether you're setting up for BETI or not? I would say it's probably the latter, but the fact that it's happening will set us up very well for BETI. And I do believe that as people look and see the value that BETI is going to deliver for both the business as well as the employees, I think you're going to even have more usage around the DDX and Manager on-the-Go, from a best practice perspective."

Plus I really -- it's something that was happening anyway. I mean it wasn't that the pandemic created these opportunities. I think the pandemic more sealed the fate of the old way. In fact, we were already seeing trends with employees that are used to using consumer-based technology to do banking, get a plane ticket, order a coffee and then they came to work, and it was 1992 through e-mail and what have you. And so we were already seeing the trends of that usage happening. I think the pandemic just provided a stronger proof source for. The reason for that, it probably accelerated that for some people.

I mean well, BETI is a unique product that comes with a unique strategy, and that is about having employees being able to visualize what their checks are, what the check is going to be, what components impact their check to where they're able to visualize and participate in that throughout the pay period and then at pay period end, they're able to approve that, that check is correct. And what that does is it eliminates manuals, voids, adjustments, all the things that payroll departments and accounting departments traditionally have to do after the fact once they found out that, that check wasn't -- didn't exactly include everything that it should have for that employee. 
And so by moving the process up to the beginning of the pay period versus at the end of the pay period, it's going to change the way people do that payroll. 
As far as the win rate, do I think it's going to impact our win rate? Absolutely, once people really start using it. The DDX we came out with, it started impacting our retention not long after we came out with it. And Manager on-the-Go, I would say, is a similar product as that. And all of that got more and more people engaged, employees, again, engaged in our software and interacting with the database on their own.

I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our second quarter 2021 results and the opportunities we are pursuing as we look ahead. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
We delivered very strong second quarter 2021 results with revenue of $242 million that grew 33.3%, our fastest quarterly growth rate compared to the prior year period since Q4 of 2016 and well above the top end of our guidance range. The upside from the quarter was primarily a result of broad-based demand strength from new client adds and consistent cross-selling to existing clients. 
Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $87 million, representing an increase of 42% over the prior year period. With these strong results, we are once again raising our full year guidance, which Craig will discuss in more detail. The investments we make in our products generate tremendous value for our clients and drive our differentiated employee strategy. Our newest employee innovation is BETI, the industry's first self-service payroll technology, allowing employees to do their own payroll, which we officially rolled out to the market in early July. BETI, which stands for better employee transaction interface, is an employee-driven payroll experience and represents one of the most important advances we've made to date. 
With BETI, employees do their own payroll, which allows our clients to benefit from increased payroll accuracy while employees gain full insight to their paycheck, including advanced knowledge of take-home pay and how it's calculated. Employees have a direct connection to their paycheck to resolve errors well before payday, so they don't have to wait on or contact anyone for assistance. The additional clarity on how their pay changes and is calculated combined with automatic alerts when items require their action gives employees and clients confidence in the accuracy of their payroll. I'm very pleased with the launch so far. We are receiving tremendous feedback, including a VP of HR who said BETI's the most revolutionary payroll product I've ever seen. Another comment from a Chief HR Officer noted that BETI is giving ownership of payroll to employees and managers which is great because they know better than anyone what their paychecks should be. 
As we said during our Q1 earnings call, we are planning to have 100 pilot clients on BETI in the second quarter, and we easily achieved that goal. On July 6, we opened up BETI to all clients. And through the end of July, we've already sold BETI to over 1,000 new and existing clients. I continue to expect that all Paycom clients will eventually deploy BETI. It's the only way payroll should be done. 
Our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads, and we intend to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to fuel future revenue and further expand our market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. Our messaging continues to resonate with prospects as we contrast the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution and self-service capabilities that are stronger than ever. 
Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. And once again, we had record high employee usage rates in Q2 as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. We continue to enjoy increasing traction with both smaller and larger companies. As a reminder, we added multiple inside sales teams as we have continued to have success below our target range. Due to the technological advances we've made and the demand that's building around our employee self-service initiatives, we continue to be pulled further upmarket as well. 
As a result, we are pleased to announce that we are expanding our proactive outside sales efforts from targeting firms with 50 to 5,000 employees to targeting firms with 50 to 10,000 employees. We've had success selling to organizations above our historic range driven by larger company demand. This change we are announcing today empowers our sales representatives to proactively target in this expanded segment, and we are excited by this incremental opportunity. We have clients in this segment already, so we're confident that our solution will compete and serve these clients effectively. 
On the Paycom branding front, we recently signed a 15-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder that will transform their downtown home into the Paycom Center. Oklahoma City is home to thousands of our employees, and I'm happy that the Paycom Center will be home of the Thunder. 
We have now lapped a tough prepandemic year-over-year comparison, and Q2 is more reflective of our historical growth profile, record new client additions over this past year driving our growth. While we saw a very small headcount improvement in our prepandemic client revenue base, our guidance and future growth initiatives are not reliant on any employment improvement. 
In summary, Q2 was a very strong quarter that reflects the strength of our execution throughout the pandemic and the investments we've made to further distance ourselves from the competition. Innovation, customer service and new client growth represent the foundation of our long-term revenue growth strategy and with only approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM, we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees for their resilience and commitment to winning. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

We are very pleased with our second quarter results with total revenues of $242.1 million, representing 33.3% over the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by broad-based strength with new client wins and consistent cross-selling to existing clients. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $237.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33.5% from the comparable prior year period. 
Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $206.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.4%. For 2021, we remain on target for adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 86%. 
Adjusted total administrative expenses were $136 million for the second quarter as compared to $106 million in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $64.3 million or 26.6% of revenues. 
Our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads, both within and outside our historical target market range of 50 to 5,000 employees. We plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. And as Chad mentioned, we have increased our target market range to 50 to 10,000, thus empowering our sales representatives to proactively target more companies. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 10.8% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $38 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $27.7 million in the prior year period. We continue to be very pleased with the high-quality innovation we are seeing from our investments in R&D, and we'll continue to aggressively recruit talent in R&D to drive our future growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $87 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 35.9% of total revenues compared to $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 33.7% of total revenues. 
Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share versus $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $56.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share versus $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2021 to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $95 million to $100 million. 
For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 24% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 26% to 27%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $202.4 million and total debt of $30 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $57 million for the second quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021.
During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 94,000 shares for a total of roughly $32 million. Through June 30, 2021, Paycom has repurchased over 4.2 million shares since 2016, for a total of approximately $455 million, and we currently have roughly $300 million remaining in our buyback program. 
Shifting to guidance. We are pleased to provide strong third quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance we achieved in the first half of 2021, and we are raising our full year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q3 full year guidance are as follows: for the third quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $249 million to $251 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range; we expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $87 million to $89 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35.2% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion, up from $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion or approximately 23.2% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $410 million to $412 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. When combined, we now expect revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin to easily exceed the rule of 60 this year. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter, which gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the launch of BETI, an expanded target market and a deep product development pipeline, we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come.

Same thing's happened here up to 10,000. We continue to be pulled further upmarket. I would say that the buying criteria for companies of that size has changed. We're all working with the same type of employee. There's no such thing as a large market and a small market employee. You can work for a 3-employee 1 company and work for a 10,000-employee company the next.

And then they get to find out on payday what it meant. I mean it's similar to blinding the pilots right before they land. 
And so what we've done is taken that blindfold off to where employees understand how their checks are calculated, and they can help the payroll department have perfect payrolls because there's not a payroll person out there that doesn't have anxiety going into each payroll day because they want it to be perfect. And so what BETI does is help everybody get to the right level of act. 
And it also eliminates a lot of the after fact manual checks, voids and adjustments that oftentimes clients have to do after an employee's check is incorrect, and we know how important it is for employees' checks to be perfect. They expect it. So we're having a lot of success with it, and I would expect us to continue that."

It's hard for me to say that a 5,000-employee company's sales cycle is going to be the same as a 150-employee company sales cycle. I will say the 5,000-employee sales cycle is the same as a 10,000-employee sales cycle. So",264,"No, I don't. I mean a little bit. It's hard for me to say that a 5,000-employee company's sales cycle is going to be the same as a 150-employee company sales cycle. I will say the 5,000-employee sales cycle is the same as a 10,000-employee sales cycle. So I don't know that there's some major differences between the 2 of those as far as what their sales cycles would be. 
We're still not looking to engage with a long sales cycle that requires us to link up with multiple disparate systems, so somebody has to be a fit for us to go into that. Something else I would say is we continue to have strength in downmarket. We continue to aggressively achieve our lead volumes and they continue to go up. And oftentimes, those leads are also small business. And so first of this year, we had 4 sales teams, and that was up from 1 the previous year. Throughout this year, we've added another 6 inside sales teams. And so now we're at 10 inside sales teams which sell the emerging business, so that would be the below 50 market. So we continue to do extremely well below. We continue to be pulled upmarket because, again, it's the same employee interface, whether you work for a 15-employee company or whether you work for a 10,000-employee company, those employees expect ease of use and easy access to their system. And so we're seeing a lot of momentum being created based off of employee usage needs and how much it makes it easier for them."

It's something that we turn on for you, but what we have to work with you to convert are your processes. You've got a lot of these processes that happen after the fact. We need to have those happen at the beginning or during the payroll transaction. And once you do that, a lot of the processes you'd normally do after the fact are irrelevant. We're able to displace those. And so we eliminate a lot of processes. And then with some of the processes, we move them into -- earlier in the processing phase. And so -- but in answer to your question, we haven't had anybody turn it off. Once you turn it on and that's what your employees are doing, you have a very high satisfaction rate with employees. And you have a very strong ROI. BETI, itself, 100% pays for itself. And it actually helps even pay for the payroll -- the entire payroll module because there's an incredible amount of ROI when you're not having to do manual checks, voids, adjustments, and wire money into employees' accounts to cover NSF fees they may have because their payroll is long. 
And so it also gives employees a visibility into what their check is going to be. A lot of people live check to check. I mean over 80%, 85% of the U.S. employee lives check to check and they need to know exactly what their pay is going to be. And if it's $30 off, that's a big difference for them. And so BETI gives them visibility long before check date and gives them the ability to interact with their check to make sure it's accurate, which again increases ROI for the business. It also lowers the business's exposure and certain risks associated with paying people. There's some pretty specific laws on making sure you pay your employees correctly and that you pay them on time. And with BETI, that's easily achieved."

But I'm sure that we will have our internal sales group, our client relations group continuing to reach out to clients of all characteristics, whether they have the products currently required or just partial. So there is an opportunity there for us. 
As far as handicapping it, again, we consider our pricing competitive in nature. But there are opportunities for us out there. I do want to say this, though. Our revenue gains are going to be primarily driven by new business wins, just because of what the -- and I'm saying new logo wins just because of the size of a new logo compared to the potential upsell of that same logo."

Yes, I mean, because it's the way we're training and setting them up. We're not training you on the old model now. I mean when you're going through conversion and training, we're training you on how employees do their own payroll. We're not training you how and you input your employees data into our system. And so yes, it's part of the conversion. And so it would be illogical for me to think that anybody would even try to do it the old way. 
And also, it's included in the ROI. I mean now our ROI cases include BETI, and it's an important part of the ROI. I mean you can use BETI and actually, it'll -- it can help pay for the entire system, depending upon how many true issues you've been having in payroll. Payroll is -- it's a high risk, low reward activity. If you get it right, who cares, employees expect it. And if you get it wrong, you upset employees. They have NSF fees and then you get to pay tax penalties. And so having perfect payroll is extremely important, and it just wouldn't make any sense to me that any client would buy our product without BETI. And it wouldn't make any sense that they would -- since they bought it, make any sense that they wouldn't use it because their employees want to use it."

I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our second quarter 2021 results and the opportunities we are pursuing as we look ahead. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.  
We delivered very strong second quarter 2021 results with revenue of $242 million that grew 33.3%, our fastest quarterly growth rate compared to the prior year period since Q4 of 2016 and well above the top end of our guidance range. The upside from the quarter was primarily a result of broad-based demand strength from new client adds and consistent cross-selling to existing clients.  
Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $87 million, representing an increase of 42% over the prior year period. With these strong results, we are once again raising our full year guidance, which Craig will discuss in more detail. The investments we make in our products generate tremendous value for our clients and drive our differentiated employee strategy. Our newest employee innovation is BETI, the industry's first self-service payroll technology, allowing employees to do their own payroll, which we officially rolled out to the market in early July. BETI, which stands for Better Employee Transaction Interface, is an employee-driven payroll experience and represents one of the most important advances we've made to date.  
With BETI, employees do their own payroll, which allows our clients to benefit from increased payroll accuracy while employees gain full insight to their paycheck, including advanced knowledge of take-home pay and how it's calculated. Employees have a direct connection to their paycheck to resolve errors well before payday, so they don't have to wait on or contact anyone for assistance. The additional clarity on how their pay changes and is calculated combined with automatic alerts when items require their action gives employees and clients confidence in the accuracy of their payroll. 
I'm very pleased with the launch so far. We are receiving tremendous feedback, including a VP of HR who said BETI's the most revolutionary payroll product I've ever seen.  Another comment from a Chief HR Officer noted that BETI is giving ownership of payroll to employees and managers which is great because they know better than anyone what their paychecks should be.  
As we said during our Q1 earnings call, we are planning to have 100 pilot clients on BETI in the second quarter, and we easily achieved that goal. On July 6, we opened up BETI to all clients. And through the end of July, we've already sold BETI to over 1,000 new and existing clients. I continue to expect that all Paycom clients will eventually deploy BETI. It's the only way payroll should be done.  
Our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads, and we intend to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to fuel future revenue and further expand our market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. Our messaging continues to resonate with prospects as we contrast the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution and self-service capabilities that are stronger than ever.  
Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. And once again, we had record high employee usage rates in Q2 as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. We continue to enjoy increasing traction with both smaller and larger companies. As a reminder, we added multiple inside sales teams as we have continued to have success below our target range. Due to the technological advances we've made and the demand that's building around our employee self-service initiatives, we continue to be pulled further upmarket as well.  
As a result, we are pleased to announce that we are expanding our proactive outside sales efforts from targeting firms with 50 to 5,000 employees to targeting firms with 50 to 10,000 employees. We've had success selling to organizations above our historic range, driven by larger company demand. This change we are announcing today empowers our sales representatives to proactively target in this expanded segment, and we are excited by this incremental opportunity. We have clients in this segment already, so we're confident that our solution will compete and serve these clients effectively.  
On the Paycom branding front, we recently signed a 15-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder that will transform their downtown home into the Paycom Center. Oklahoma City is home to thousands of our employees, and I'm happy that the Paycom Center will be home of the Thunder.  
We have now lapped a tough prepandemic year-over-year comparison, and Q2 is more reflective of our historical growth profile, record new client additions over this past year driving our growth. While we saw a very small headcount improvement in our prepandemic client revenue base, our guidance and future growth initiatives are not reliant on any employment improvement.  
In summary, Q2 was a very strong quarter that reflects the strength of our execution throughout the pandemic and the investments we've made to further distance ourselves from the competition. Innovation, customer service and new client growth represent the foundation of our long-term revenue growth strategy. And with only approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM, we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees for their resilience and commitment to winning.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

We are very pleased with our second quarter results with total revenues of $242.1 million, representing growth of 33.3% over the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by broad-based strength with new client wins and consistent cross-selling to existing clients.  
Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $237.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33.5% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $206.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.4%. For 2021, we remain on target for adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 86%.  
Adjusted total administrative expenses were $136 million for the second quarter as compared to $106 million in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $64.3 million or 26.6% of revenues.  
Our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads, both within and outside our historical target market range of 50 to 5,000 employees. We plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. And as Chad mentioned, we have increased our target market range to 50 to 10,000, thus empowering our outside sales representatives to proactively target larger companies.  
Adjusted R&D expense was $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 10.8% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $38 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $27.7 million in the prior year period. We continue to be very pleased with the high-quality innovation we are seeing from our investments in R&D, and we'll continue to aggressively recruit talent in R&D to drive our future growth.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $87 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 35.9% of total revenues compared to $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 33.7% of total revenues.  
Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share versus $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods.  
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $56.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share versus $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2021 to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $95 million to $100 million.  
For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 24% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 26% to 27%.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $202.4 million and total debt of $30 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $57 million for the second quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021. 
During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 94,000 shares for a total of roughly $32 million. Through June 30, 2021, Paycom has repurchased over 4.2 million shares since 2016, for a total of approximately $455 million, and we currently have roughly $300 million remaining in our buyback program.  
Shifting to guidance. We are pleased to provide strong third quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance we achieved in the first half of 2021, and we are raising our full year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q3 and full year guidance are as follows: for the third quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $249 million to $251 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range; we expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $87 million to $89 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35.2% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion, up from $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion or approximately 23.2% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $410 million to $412 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. When combined, we now expect revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin to easily exceed the Rule of 60 this year. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter, which gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the launch of BETI, an expanded target market and a deep product development pipeline, we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come.

And so employees, like I've been saying, employees pretty much fly blind into every payroll. They do the work. They clock in, clock out, put in their expenses, manage benefits, manage time off and everything else. And then they get blindfolded before payday. And then they get to find out on payday what it meant. I mean it's similar to blinding the pilots right before they land. 
And so what we've done is taken that blindfold off to where employees understand how their checks are calculated, and they can help the payroll department have perfect payrolls because there's not a payroll person out there that doesn't have anxiety going into each payroll day because they want it to be perfect. And so what BETI does is help everybody get to the right level of accuracy. 
And it also eliminates a lot of the after fact manual checks, voids and adjustments that oftentimes clients have to do after an employee's check is incorrect, and we know how important it is for employees' checks to be perfect. They expect it. So we're having a lot of success with it, and I would expect us to continue that."

As far as macro, we've been going through this now for a little bit. I've been talking a little bit about us having some improvement with the prepandemic client base as far as this quarter. I'd say we saw an improvement in hiring during this past quarter and the impact that it had on our revenue for this quarter from our prepandemic client base was $1 million to $1.5 million for the quarter.

So I don't know that there's some major differences between the 2 of those as far as what their sales cycles would be. 
We're still not looking to engage with a long sales cycle that requires us to link up with multiple disparate systems, so somebody has to be a fit for us to go into that. Something else I would say is we continue to have strength in downmarket. We continue to aggressively achieve our lead volumes, and they continue to go up. And oftentimes, those leads are also small business. 
And so first of this year, we had 4 sales teams, and that was up from 1 the previous year. Throughout this year, we've added another 6 inside sales teams. And so now we're at 10 inside sales teams which sell the emerging business, so that would be the below 50 market. So we continue to do extremely well below 50. And we continue to be pulled upmarket because, again, it's the same employee interface, whether you work for a 15-employee company or whether you work for a 10,000-employee company, those employees expect ease of use and easy access to their system. And so we're seeing a lot of momentum being created based off of employee usage needs and how much it makes it easier for them."

And so well, with BETI, you're already on it, it's something that we turn on for you, but what we have to work with you to convert are your processes. You've got a lot of these processes that happen after the fact. We need to have those happen at the beginning or during the payroll transaction. And once you do that, a lot of the processes you'd normally do after the fact are irrelevant. We're able to displace those. And so we eliminate a lot of processes. And then with some of the processes, we move them into -- earlier in the processing phase. 
And so -- but in answer to your question, we haven't had anybody turn it off. Once you turn it on and that's what your employees are doing, you have a very high satisfaction rate with employees. And you have a very strong ROI. BETI, itself, 100% pays for itself. And it actually helps even pay for the payroll -- the entire payroll module because there's an incredible amount of ROI when you're not having to do manual checks, voids, adjustments, and wire money into employees' accounts to cover NSF fees they may have because their payroll is wrong. 
And so it also gives employees a visibility into what their check is going to be. A lot of people live check to check. I mean over 80%, 85% of the U.S. employee lives check to check, and they need to know exactly what their pay is going to be. And if it's $30 off, that's a big difference for them. And so BETI gives them visibility long before check date and gives them the ability to interact with their check to make sure it's accurate, which again increases ROI for the business. It also lowers the business's exposure and certain risks associated with paying people. There's some pretty specific laws on making sure you pay your employees correctly and that you pay them on time. And with BETI, that's easily achieved."

But there are modules that would be required to use BETI, like pay time off, time and attendance, expense management, benefits administration. There are some of them definitely that you're going to want to use them because without them, you wouldn't be able to use BETI. 
A lot of those are fairly popular products to us. But we have several clients that don't have them. And so I would like to thank our sales reps who're probably out there right now. Our CRRs are probably working with a lot of those clients that are already ready to go where we just go and click a button, eliminate most of your processes and shift a few to the beginning. But I'm sure that we will have our internal sales group, our client relations group continuing to reach out to clients of all characteristics, whether they have all of the products currently required or just partial. So there is an opportunity there for us.

And also, it's included in the ROI. I mean now our ROI cases include BETI, and it's an important part of the ROI. I mean you can use BETI and actually, it'll pay -- it can help pay for the entire system, depending upon how many true issues you've been having in payroll. Payroll is a -- it's a high risk, low-reward activity. If you get it right, who cares, employees expect it. And if you get it wrong, you upset employees. They have NSF fees, and then you get to pay tax penalties. And so having perfect payroll is extremely important, and it just wouldn't make any sense to me that any client would buy our product without BETI.

I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our third quarter 2021 results and our progress on key initiatives. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
We delivered very strong third quarter 2021 results with revenue of $256 million, representing robust year-over-year revenue growth of 30.4%, which was above the top end of our guidance range. We continue to see strong demand for our products across our target market, and we are having great success attracting new clients. We have reinvested and will continue to reinvest revenue upside into the business while still delivering attractive adjusted EBITDA margins. With these strong results, we are once again raising our full year guidance, which Craig will discuss in more detail. 
Our innovative solutions continue to gain popularity and we are being recognized by industry organizations for their impact on the human capital management industry. In September, Paycom was once again awarded the 2021 top HR product honor at the HR Technology Conference for our newest innovation BETI. This marks the third consecutive year for Paycom to receive such honors, which included the Direct Data Exchange in 2019, Manager on-the-Go in 2020 and now BETI in 2021. It is precisely the combination of these 3 industry first, coupled with our comprehensive single database, that is transforming the human capital management industry and turning employee usage and easy-to-use solutions into key buying criteria for clients. 
BETI is a self-service payroll technology that allows employees to do their own payroll, and we are having great success in the market. As a reminder, with BETI, employees submit their own time work, and make their own benefit selections, schedule deductions, manage tax statuses, remit expenses, request time off and do all the things that an employee does to calculate a check. BETI does the rest and works with the employee to ensure a perfect payroll for them, prior to the payroll. Employees doing their own payroll is the only way payroll should be done. I'm very pleased with the market response to BETI, and I continue to expect all clients to eventually deploy BETI. 
Our advertising and marketing efforts continue to deliver strong demo leads that are fueling our revenue growth. And we will intend to continue to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to further expand our market share in the large and expanding HCM TAM. Our advertising strategy is working, and we are deliberately reinvesting revenue upside into advertising, marketing and product innovation. You've heard me say consistently that we are willing to trade a point of margin for a point of growth, but we are unwilling to trade a point of margin for a point of nothing. And that philosophy has served us well over the years, and you can see it in our results. 
On the sales front, we are seeing success with both smaller and larger companies. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we are having in our recently expanded target market range of companies with up to 10,000 employees, where our messaging around ease of use and the employee self-service is resonating. Finally, it's great to see all the Paycom faces back in the office, even if behind masks. 
We have successfully transitioned nearly all employees back to our offices around the country, and it is great to see we are getting our office culture back. While we accomplished extraordinary things working remotely, I believe we're even better together. Many of our new hires are experiencing for the first time, the daily buzz and enthusiasm that makes Paycom a unique place to work. While our sales teams are still selling virtually, we are already seeing the benefits of everyone being safely back in the office, sharing best practices and collaborating more closely. 
In summary, Q3 was a very strong quarter, driven by record new client revenue. The investments we've made throughout 2020 and to date in 2021 have made Paycom more differentiated than ever, and we are seeing the benefits across the sales, service and product organizations. As a reminder, we have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM and a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees for their grit and commitment to success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $251.3 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30.4% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $214.8 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.8%. Third quarter margins were impacted by both our returns, our current and future growth. 
For 2021, we expect to deliver a very strong adjusted gross

As Chad suggested, growth remains a top priority, and advertising is a productive lever that we have continued to deploy to drive revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expense was $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 11.4% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $29.8 million in the prior year period. Even in this tight labor market, we are having good success attracting and retaining talent. Adjusted EBITDA was $89.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 35% of total revenues compared to $67.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 
[Audio Gap] 
for the third quarter was $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share versus $27.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share versus $40.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2021 to be approximately $22 million to $24 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $98 million to $100 million. For [Audio Gap] 23% to 25% rate to be 25% to 27%. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $230.9 million and total debt of $29.6 million. Cash from operations was $83.2 million for the third quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we've repurchased approximately 61,000 shares for a total of roughly $29 million. Through September 30, 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of approximately $484 million, and we currently have roughly $271 million remaining in our buyback program. 
Shifting to guidance. We are pleased to provide strong fourth quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance year-to-date, and we are raising our full year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q4 and full year guidance are as follows: for the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $274.5 million to $276.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 25% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $103 million to $105 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37.7% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.045 billion to $1.047 billion, up from $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $413 million to $415 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter and how the full year has been shaping up. Product differentiation, outstanding customer service and our use of effective advertising and sales levers are all contributing to our strong results, and we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come. 
With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?"

So BETI itself, it's incremental to our overall revenue, and it will prove very positive. But really, where it's making the impact, it's driving an incredible amount of value for the client. I mean, it's a very nominal spend for them to add it. But the value multiple that they're receiving, just by adding BETI, really makes all the other products that we've already provided to the much more valuable with the stronger return, and it's very measurable for both them and the employee. 
One thing we are starting to receive a lot more of right now, are employee referrals who have used BETI even at one company, they go to another company, and we're continuing to have strong referrals from rank-and-file employees that have used our technology and now are at a different location or business."

I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our third quarter 2021 results and our progress on key initiatives. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 
We delivered very strong third quarter 2021 results with revenue of $256 million, representing robust year-over-year revenue growth of 30.4%, which was above the top end of our guidance range. We continue to see strong demand for our products across our target market, and we are having great success attracting new clients. We have reinvested and will continue to reinvest revenue upside into the business while still delivering attractive adjusted EBITDA margins. With these strong results, we are once again raising our full year guidance, which Craig will discuss in more detail. 
Our innovative solutions continue to gain popularity and we are being recognized by industry organizations for their impact on the human capital management industry. In September, Paycom was once again awarded the 2021 top HR product honor at the HR Technology Conference for our newest innovation BETI. This marks the third consecutive year for Paycom to receive such honors, which included the Direct Data Exchange in 2019, Manager on-the-Go in 2020 and now BETI in 2021. It is precisely the combination of these 3 industry first, coupled with our comprehensive single database, that is transforming the human capital management industry and turning employee usage and easy-to-use solutions into key buying criteria for clients. 
BETI is a self-service payroll technology that allows employees to do their own payroll, and we are having great success in the market. As a reminder, with BETI, employees submit their own time work, and make their own benefit selections, schedule deductions, manage tax statuses, remit expenses, request time off and do all the things that an employee does to calculate a check. BETI does the rest and works with the employee to ensure a perfect payroll for them, prior to the payroll. Employees doing their own payroll is the only way payroll should be done. I'm very pleased with the market response to BETI, and I continue to expect all clients to eventually deploy BETI. 
Our advertising and marketing efforts continue to deliver strong demo leads that are fueling our revenue growth. And we will intend to continue to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to further expand our market share in the large and expanding HCM TAM. Our advertising strategy is working, and we are deliberately reinvesting revenue upside into advertising, marketing and product innovation. You've heard me say consistently that we are willing to trade a point of margin for a point of growth, but we are unwilling to trade a point of margin for a point of nothing. And that philosophy has served us well over the years, and you can see it in our results. 
On the sales front, we are seeing success with both smaller and larger companies. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we are having in our recently expanded target market range of companies with up to 10,000 employees, where our messaging around ease of use and the employee self-service is resonating. Finally, it's great to see all the Paycom faces back in the office, even if behind masks. 
We have successfully transitioned nearly all employees back to our offices around the country, and it is great to see we are getting our office culture back. While we accomplished extraordinary things working remotely, I believe we're even better together. Many of our new hires are experiencing for the first time, the daily buzz and enthusiasm that makes Paycom a unique place to work. While our sales teams are still selling virtually, we are already seeing the benefits of everyone being safely back in the office, sharing best practices and collaborating more closely. 
In summary, Q3 was a very strong quarter, driven by record new client revenue. The investments we've made throughout 2020 and to date in 2021 have made Paycom more differentiated than ever, and we are seeing the benefits across the sales, service and product organizations. As a reminder, we have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM and a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees for their grit and commitment to success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?"

We are very pleased with our third quarter results, with total revenues of $256.2 million, representing growth of 30.4% over the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by strong new client revenue growth. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $251.3 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30.4% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $214.8 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.8%. Third quarter margins were impacted by both our return to office and our aggressive hiring of the individuals needed to service our current and future growth. 
For 2021, we expect to deliver a very strong adjusted gross  margin of approximately 85%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $142.5 million for the third quarter as compared to $113.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2021  was $66.3 million or 25.9% of revenues. Our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads, and we plan to continue to invest in advertising, given the strong return on our investment we are seeing. 
As Chad suggested, growth remains a top priority, and advertising is a productive lever that we have continued to deploy to drive revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expense was $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 11.4% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $29.8 million in the prior year period. Even in this tight labor market, we are having good success attracting and retaining talent. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $89.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 35% of total revenues compared to $67.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 or 34.3% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share versus $27.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share versus $40.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior year period. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2021 to be approximately $22 million to $24 million. For the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $98 million to $100 million. For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 23% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 27%. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $230.9 million and total debt of $29.6 million. Cash from operations was $83.2 million for the third quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we've repurchased approximately 61,000 shares for a total of roughly $29 million. Through September 30, 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of approximately $484 million, and we currently have roughly $271 million remaining in our buyback program. 
Shifting to guidance. We are pleased to provide strong fourth quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance year-to-date, and we are raising our full year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q4 and full year guidance are as follows: for the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $274.5 million to $276.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 25% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $103 million to $105 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37.7% at the midpoint of the range. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.045 billion to $1.047 billion, up from $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $413 million to $415 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter and how the full year has been shaping up. Product differentiation, outstanding customer service and our use of effective advertising and sales levers are all contributing to our strong results, and we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come.

We've never been a company that's been dependent upon that nor have we really looked at that as any type of driver for us. And probably still today, wouldn't even have thought of it as a question, except for we did go through the pandemic and lost a significant amount through our client base. But from a macro standpoint of what we see amongst our client base, we see stability and our growth is coming from our ability to add new clients onto our platform."

We've always -- clients have always sold against us with different pricing discounting and different people accentuate their positives. The positive we accentuate is the fact that we drive significant return on investment for those in a low-cost total ownership, for those businesses that choose Paycom, and that's all experienced through employee usage and an easy-to-use product."

I would say every client that's deployed BETI would have to have the full solution set that BETI requires to be able to even implement BETI. So that would have happened upfront. Again, I do want to state that most all of the products required or necessary to work BETI are our most popular products. And we're always pretty -- we've always been pretty good at selling the value to both the client and the employee for them taking that product and using it. 
So BETI itself, it's incremental to our overall revenue, and it will prove very positive. But really, where it's making the impact, it's driving an incredible amount of value for the client. I mean, it's a very nominal spend for them to add it. But the value multiple that they're receiving, just by adding BETI, really makes all the other products that we've already provided to have been much more valuable with the stronger return, and it's very measurable for both them and the employee. 
One thing we are starting to receive a lot more of right now, are employee referrals who have used BETI even at one company, they go to another company, and we're continuing to have strong referrals from rank-and-file employees that have used our technology and now are at a different location or business."
