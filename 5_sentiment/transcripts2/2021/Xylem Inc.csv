As you'll see from our release this morning, the team delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum entering 2021. Every segment and every end market made considerable gains on a quarter sequential basis. And for Xylem overall, the team outperformed expectations across the major metrics. Those being revenue, earnings and cash. As the year came to a close, we took full advantage of stabilizing markets, both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water Systems showed quicker resilience than anticipated. And we also affirmed our growth trajectory in Measurement & Control Solutions, building on the large project wins we talked about last quarter by adding other headline AMI deal in Houston, Texas.
We also gathered pace with our industry-leading digital portfolio as the pandemic accelerated customer adoption of digital transformation. Revenue and orders trends both improved significantly. One caveat is that orders were still down slightly due to a scope reduction and a previous large win in India. Otherwise, orders grew in all 3 of our segments.
Xylem's large installed base of core products and established markets provided exceptional resilience on underlying demand for essential services. At the same time, our global presence allowed us to capture the benefits of early recovery in places like China, which grew 18% in the quarter; and also in Europe, where we grew 6%. As a result of that positioning on a large and resilient installed base, combined with a vibrant growth platform, we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs. They're up 16% overall, and up 30% shippable in 2022 and beyond.
We know growth really happens in a straight line. And clearly, the global challenges of 2020 put a hitch in year-on-year numbers, including margin. But I am very pleased with how we responded given these conditions. We took quick action on spending and on structural cost, and we also made significant productivity improvements. As a result, we returned to progress on margins in the third and fourth quarters, although we didn't entirely offset COVID's effects. Our supply chain execution and customers serve with pandemic, and we help them deliver the essential services their communities depend upon.
Our operational discipline delivered favorable bottom line outcomes, even in unfavorable market conditions, strengthening our financial position through the year. The team corrected for the volatile conditions so quickly that, in fact, we delivered free cash flow conversion north of 180%. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by early signs of market recovery. The ramp-up of vaccinations offers hope for an eventual return to normalcy, but we're not there yet. We are still in uncertain times. But we've nevertheless entered 2021 in a very strong position, and we are on course to capitalize on our increased competitiveness, financial strength and commercial momentum.
With that, I now want to hand it over to Sandy for more detail on how our segments performed."
118218449,692432990,2191730,"Xylem Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically ver",1154,"Thanks, Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically versus the same period last year. That performance exceeded our expectations with upside in all of our end markets and geographically strong growth in China and Europe.
I will touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities and industrial were both down 3%. Commercial was flat and residential was up 15%. We also saw quarter sequential improvement in orders. Organic orders were down 1% in the quarter as we delivered a second consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. This result most notably reflects the return to growth in M&CS orders, which delivered double-digit gains, including the large win in Houston, which Patrick mentioned. Applied Water contributed solid mid single-digit growth, and Water Infrastructure orders grew mid-single digits, excluding the scope reduction of a project in India. We're still negotiating with the customer, but felt it was most prudent to reflect the scope reduction now. Otherwise, orders growth would have been high single digits for Xylem overall.
With orders accelerating and several large contract wins contributing to double-digit growth in backlog, we have good visibility of future revenue streams heading into 2021. I'm very pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline. Fourth quarter operating margin and EBITDA margin of 13.8% and 18.8%, respectively, are above our forecasted range.
Compared to the prior year, lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partly offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. I'll review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.81 due to higher-than-forecasted revenue and earnings and from a lower tax rate due to favorable jurisdictional mix.
Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 16% organically versus last year. As I mentioned a moment ago, that decline was driven by the descoped India project. Otherwise, orders would have been up mid-single digits, reflecting healthy momentum in the segment as a whole, particularly in the wastewater utility businesses. Notably, treatment was up 10% as wastewater utility CapEx budgets continue to show resilience globally.
Water Infrastructure revenue was flat organically in the quarter. Modest growth in wastewater utilities was offset by modest declines in our industrial businesses. Geographically, results were mixed. The U.S. was down high single digits, while Europe and emerging markets were up low single digits and mid-single digits, respectively. These results generally reflect the stage of COVID recovery in each region.
Operating margin and EBITDA margin for the segment were down a modest 60 to 70 basis points, respectively. Significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation, the recognition of reserves and negative mix from declines in our U.S. dewatering rental business.
Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 4% organically in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets, partly offset by modest softness in the U.S. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter. Mid-teens growth in residential was offset by softness in industrial. Commercial revenue was flat. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. was down mid-single digits as COVID impacts drove declines in the industrial and commercial businesses, offset by that strong residential growth that I just mentioned.
Europe delivered high single-digit growth, primarily driven by good pace in commercial and modest growth in residential. Emerging markets were down low single digits. Softness in industrial markets in the Middle East were partially offset by strength in the residential and industrial markets in China. Segment operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 90 and 170 basis points, respectively. Volume declines in the industrial end market and overall inflation more than offset solid productivity gains, favorable mix and some price realization in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders returned to growth in the quarter, up 13% organically. This was largely driven by double-digit growth in both water and energy. Orders in our test business were up low mid -- were up low single digits. Revenue improved considerably on a sequential basis. From the mid-teen declines we experienced in the second and third quarters, this quarter, we finished the quarter down 5%. While our core U.S. metrology business continued to experience COVID-19 related softness, the largest decline is related to the timing of project deployments. Large-scale projects that were in process, pre pandemic in both the U.S. and the Middle East have been completed. And new projects, which are part of our backlog, have been temporarily delayed due to site access restrictions. We expect that large project deployments will resume towards the end of the second quarter and further accelerate in the back half of the year. These declines were partly offset by high single-digit growth in our Analytics and Advanced Digital Solutions businesses.
Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits for the reasons I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down double digits due to the timing of prior year project deployments in the Middle East. And Europe grew double digits from demand in the test business and from the start of the Anglian water metrology project in the U.K. Segment operating income and EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 330 and 350 basis points, respectively. Lower volume, inflation and unfavorable mix were partially offset by strong productivity and cost discipline.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. I was particularly pleased with our strong cash performance for the year. We grew free cash flow by 5% for the full year, exceeding our pre-pandemic free cash flow outlook, and delivered free cash flow conversion of 181%.
Our team has been focused on driving continuous improvement on working capital for a number of years. In the difficult operating environment of 2020, they took that work another step forward, finishing at 17.6% of revenue. This is a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts, and reflects the team's progress in managing inventories and driving solid improvements in accounts receivable collections.
We benefited from favorable timing related to the settlement of restructuring, tax, interest and payroll liabilities, some of which will reverse in 2021. Our balance sheet is well positioned and includes a $1.9 billion cash balance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.
As a reminder, we'll take advantage of our cash position to repay one of our senior notes amounting to $600 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we announced an annual dividend increase of 8%. This is our tenth consecutive annual increase.
Please turn to Page 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to look forward at 2021."
118218449,692432990,2191730,"Xylem Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sandy. 2020 reminded us all that it's prudent to be humble about the fidelity of our foresight.

When COVID first began to spread around the world, we said we would focus on managing what we could control, while maintaining our investment for growth, and that's exactly what we've done. So with 2021 still presenting some uncertainty, we will apply the same kind of focus that guided us throughout 2020. In our earnings call almost exactly a year ago, I said that I expected operational discipline would be a key capability for us. I couldn't have anticipated then how much we could benefit from that capability. When 2020's big challenges arrived, the team delivered on cost, on working capital, on free cash flow and on driving commercial value from our large installed base. We're still in a challenging environment, so we'll continue to face spending until we further see improvement in our markets. We'll keep executing the structural cost program begun in 2020, which is going to deliver savings through 2021. And given some of the inflationary headwinds we're already seeing, we are redoubling our efforts to manage the price cost dynamic. We're keeping a very close eye on our supply chains, and proactively managing potential inflationary and logistics impacts.
Despite varying by market and geography, there are clearly opportunities for growth in a recovering environment. In digital transformation, the pandemic demonstrated the imperative of operational and financial resilience for utilities, which is precisely the value proposition of our advanced digital solutions. Pre-pandemic, the business case was already very compelling. But as utility operators worked heroically to keep essential services running, the stresses of the pandemic made it clear that new approaches are required. Remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly continue to see increased demand. Backlog in our advanced digital solutions grew 70% year-on-year. Although it's from a small base, the trajectory is clear. It puts us in a very attractive position as we grow not only in software platforms, but in all of the digitally enabled parts of our portfolio.
Geographically, India and China will continue to drive high growth. Despite experiencing COVID's earliest impacts, china actually grew last year. And in the 3 years leading up to 2020, India and China posed a combined average annual growth rates in the double digits. With localization strategies well advanced in both countries, our China and India teams are set to continue delivering impressive growth.
It's also worth mentioning a very solid financial foundation underpinning our growth. With the current cash balance of nearly $1.9 billion, capital deployment is clearly top of mind for us. Even with some debt repayment during the fourth quarter, that number still offers a lot of capacity. Alongside organic investment, M&A remains a top priority, and we intend to be proactive in our deployment of capital, wherever the investment case warrants. We remain disciplined about valuations, but we do see opportunity for additional investments over the next 18 months. Growth is also important to our creation of social value. We are in the very privileged position that sustainability is baked into our business model and strategy. Our portfolio of solutions has a net positive impact, not only on water, but on a wide range of sustainability outcomes. We took several bold steps on sustainability in 2020, most notably, our grand bond offering. And performance across these metrics continues to put us in a unique leadership position, both in the water sector and more broadly.
The team's progress has strengthened our position on a number of sustainability indices. We were recently added to Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index. Despite that gratifying recognition, we have so much more work to do to achieve our 2025 sustainability goals and to deliver on our mission.
I'm now going to turn it over to Sandy to provide end market and segment outlook."

Through 2020, utilities have been reassuringly resilient, down only mid-single digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results, M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still, our outlook for 2021 reflects",965,"Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020, utilities have been reassuringly resilient, down only mid-single digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results, M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still, our outlook for 2021 reflects a tempered view that utilities have not seen the end of the pandemic impacts quite yet. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues, will grow in the low to mid-single digits in 2021. We expect that same growth rate on the wastewater side as utilities continue to focus on mission-critical applications. And we expect modest recovery in OpEx growth on a global basis through the year.
In the U.S., wastewater CapEx is likely to be down modestly. However, the decline should reflect postponements rather than reductions in projects. As you would expect, we have kept close to our utility customers to understand how they are thinking about budgets and funding for this year. And while some uncertainty remains, their deepest concerns have largely abated since the low point of the pandemic.
On the clean water side, we anticipate mid single-digit growth. As I mentioned, large project deployments should begin ramping again from the second quarter, accelerating through the end of the year. The large multiyear metrology deals that we won in 2020 set us up for solid growth this year and beyond.
In industrial markets, we've seen good sequential improvement. Short-cycle orders and project activity are definitely beginning to pick up, but are still likely to be limited by COVID impacts in the near term. We expect industrial to be flattish to up low single digits. Our commercial end market outlook varies quite a bit by geography. The U.S. will continue to be sluggish. Europe, on the other hand, should continue recovering, although not at the double-digit pace we saw in the fourth quarter. And overall, we anticipate the commercial market to be flattish to down slightly for the year.
On Slide 12, you will see that we are reinstating annual guidance. While uncertainty remains especially regarding the timing and cadence of recovery, we are confident our team will deliver results in line with the following framework. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: low to mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, with solid growth in wastewater utilities being partially offset by flattish performance in the industrial markets, predominantly in our dewatering business; low single-digit growth in Applied Water. While we see pockets of recovery in this segment globally, particularly in residential, the outlook for growth in the commercial building end market is more muted. On top of that, our exposure to North America is heavier and the region has lagged on pandemic recovery.
In Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect mid- single-digit growth. Customers indicate project deployments will likely resume late in the second quarter and further accelerate through the second half of the year. We also expect to see our test assessment Services and Advanced Digital Solutions businesses, building on the momentum they delivered finishing 2020.
While we have typically provided you with both the adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the past, you will notice that we are increasing our focus and reporting around adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this measure more accurately reflects the cash performance of our businesses and will enable us to more transparently report margin performance after M&A without purchase accounting impacts. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 40 to 140 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we expect to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, up 70 to 170 basis points. This predominantly reflects the benefits from our restructuring savings, combined with volume leverage and favorable price/mix, more than offsetting inflation and investments. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.60, an increase of 14% to 26%.
Free cash flow conversion is expected to be in the range of 80% to 90%, following free cash flow conversion of 181% in 2020 and 124% in 2019. While we continue to drive continuous improvement, we expect to see increases in working capital as we return to growth, and some of the timing benefits we realized in 2020 related to the settlement of liabilities will reverse in 2021.
We believe this is purely a dynamic related to 2021, and we expect to drive 100% cash conversion in 2022 and beyond. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. One key item that I do want to draw your attention to is foreign exchange. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. FX can be volatile, and so an FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix, which will help you if we continue to see variations in the rates.
Now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate that total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This includes low single-digit growth in Applied Water and low to mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure. M&CS is expected to decline low to mid-single digits as we anticipate continuing delays from COVID before projects begin to deployment in Q2.
We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%, representing a 170 to 270 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, with the largest expansion coming from M&CS due to operational improvements and a prior year warranty charge.
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

Turning to your question on working capital. I think that the team did a terrific job on that this year. In years where your revenue growth declines, it's difficult to make improvements on a percentage basis. And the team did a super job on collections, bringing down our past dues. And we need to shout out and recognize our operations team on how they effectively managed and controlled inventory. So as we return to growth next year, working capital will be a little bit of a headwind.

Let me try to break it down for you in a couple of different pieces. So I'll start with restructuring. This year, we did take aggressive restructuring actions, and we realized about $70 million of savings from those structural programs. As we look forward into 2021, we're expecting a similar level. We have some further programs in Europe that haven't been completed yet, both related to footprint migration as well as overall efficiencies. But we do certainly expect to get those done in 2021, and that will help us from a year-over-year perspective.
Discretionary costs is another bucket that we are focused on. And as we look year-over-year, we took about $60 million of costs out from discretionary categories like travel and entertainment, services, marketing, et cetera. And our 2021 plan contemplates that about 40% of those costs will return. And then I would say that the third part of your question, you're starting to touch on inflation, which is probably the most challenging part of the equation. As you know, we saw a very stable inflationary environment for most of 2020. We did start to see that pick up at the end of 2020, and we're seeing that pressure continue in 2021. Our teams have gotten a little bit in front of that. So we have announced price actions that have been implemented in the first quarter.

We've been here before, think back to the tariff time frame. Our price realization, we're expecting that, along with productivity, will offset material and labor inflation. We've got a very strong and proven procurement team, and they are in lockstep with our commercial teams on making sure that we've got that highlighted. So again, as Sandy said, we're already using pricing actions. The impacts are different across each one of the segments based upon the impact on commodities.

Let me take the first crack at that, and then Patrick can chime in. I think as we think about the quarter sequential trends through 2021, you almost have to think about how the pandemic impacted our businesses and regions throughout the year. And so",166,"Yes. Let me take the first crack at that, and then Patrick can chime in. I think as we think about the quarter sequential trends through 2021, you almost have to think about how the pandemic impacted our businesses and regions throughout the year. And so I think right out of the gate in Q1, I think what's important is that we're going to return to growth, and you're going to see meaningful margin expansion. From a margin perspective, the biggest growth happens in the first half of the year because as you saw, our margins were much stronger in Q3 and Q4 than they were in the earlier part of the year. And then I think as we focus and drill down on M&CS, it's the deployments in the second half that from a dollar value perspective starts to accelerate. And as we exit 2021, again, I think our revenue and margin levels will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2019."

We talked about resuming CapEx to be more in line with historical levels. And I think the third one is more unique to 2020 and 2021, and that is -- there were a number of liability categories that we benefited from the timing on, and that benefit was about $75 million in 2020. 2/3 of that will reverse next year.

As you'll see from our release this morning, the team delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum entering 2021. Every segment and every end market made considerable gains on a quarter sequential basis. And for Xylem overall, the team outperformed expectations across the major metrics. Those being revenue, earnings and cash. 
As the year came to a close, we took full advantage of stabilizing markets. Both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water Systems showed quicker resilience than anticipated. And we also affirmed our growth trajectory in Measurement & Control Solutions, building on the large project wins we talked about last quarter by adding another headline AMI deal in Houston, Texas. We also gathered pace with our industry-leading digital portfolio as the pandemic accelerated customer adoption of digital transformation. Revenue and orders trends both improved significantly. One caveat is that orders were still down slightly due to a scope reduction and a previous large win in India. Otherwise, orders grew in all 3 of our segments.
Xylem's large installed base of core products and established markets provided exceptional resilience on underlying demand for essential services. At the same time, our global presence allowed us to capture the benefits of early recovery in places like China, which grew 18% in the quarter; and also in Europe, where we grew 6%. As a result of that positioning on a large and resilient installed base, combined with a vibrant growth platform, we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs. They're up 16% overall, and up 30% shippable in 2022 and beyond.
We know growth really happens in a straight line. And clearly, the global challenges of 2020 put a hitch in year-on-year numbers, including margin. But I am very pleased with how we responded given these conditions. We took quick action on spending and on structural cost, and we also made significant productivity improvements. As a result, we returned to progress on margins in the third and fourth quarters, although we didn't entirely offset COVID's effects. Our supply chain execution ensured we kept customers served in pandemic, and we help them to deliver the essential services their communities depend upon.
Our operational discipline delivered favorable bottom line outcomes, even in unfavorable market conditions, strengthening our financial position through the year. The team corrected for the volatile conditions so quickly that, in fact, we delivered free cash flow conversion north of 180%. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by early signs of market recovery. The ramp-up of vaccinations offers hope for an eventual return to normalcy, but we're not there yet. We are still in uncertain times. But we've nevertheless entered 2021 in a very strong position, and we are on course to capitalize on our increased competitiveness, financial strength and commercial momentum.
With that, I now want to hand it over to Sandy for more detail on how our segments performed."

We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically ver",1154,"Thanks, Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically versus the same period last year. That performance exceeded our expectations with upside in all of our end markets and geographically strong growth in China and Europe.
I will touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities and industrial were both down 3%. Commercial was flat and residential was up 15%. We also saw quarter sequential improvement in orders. Organic orders were down 1% in the quarter as we delivered a second consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. This result most notably reflects the return to growth in M&CS orders, which delivered double-digit gains, including the large win in Houston, which Patrick mentioned. Applied Water contributed solid mid single-digit growth, and Water Infrastructure orders grew mid-single digits, excluding the scope reduction of a project in India. 
We're still negotiating with the customer, but felt it was most prudent to reflect the scope reduction now. Otherwise, orders growth would have been high single digits for Xylem overall. With orders accelerating and several large contract wins contributing to double-digit growth in backlog, we have good visibility of future revenue streams heading into 2021. I'm very pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline. 
Fourth quarter operating margin and EBITDA margin of 13.8% and 18.8%, respectively, are above our forecasted range. Compared to the prior year, lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partly offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. I'll review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.81 due to higher-than-forecasted revenue and earnings and from a lower tax rate due to favorable jurisdictional mix.
Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 16% organically versus last year. As I mentioned a moment ago, that decline was driven by the descoped India project. Otherwise, orders would have been up mid-single digits, reflecting healthy momentum in the segment as a whole, particularly in the wastewater utility businesses. Notably, treatment was up 10% as wastewater utility CapEx budgets continue to show resilience globally. Water Infrastructure revenue was flat organically in the quarter. Modest growth in wastewater utilities was offset by modest declines in our industrial businesses. 
Geographically, results were mixed. The U.S. was down high single digits, while Europe and emerging markets were up low single digits and mid-single digits, respectively. These results generally reflect the stage of COVID recovery in each region. Operating margin and EBITDA margin for the segment were down a modest 60 to 70 basis points, respectively. Significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation, the recognition of reserves and negative mix from declines in our U.S. dewatering rental business.
Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 4% organically in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets, partly offset by modest softness in the U.S. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter. Mid-teens growth in residential was offset by softness in industrial. Commercial revenue was flat. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. was down mid-single digits as COVID impacts drove declines in the industrial and commercial businesses, offset by that strong residential growth that I just mentioned.
Europe delivered high single-digit growth, primarily driven by good pace in commercial and modest growth in residential. Emerging markets were down low single digits. Softness in industrial markets in the Middle East were partially offset by strength in the residential and industrial markets in China. Segment operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 90 and 170 basis points, respectively. Volume declines in the industrial end market and overall inflation more than offset solid productivity gains, favorable mix and some price realization in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders returned to growth in the quarter, up 13% organically. This was largely driven by double-digit growth in both water and energy. Orders in our test business were up low mid -- were up low single digits. Revenue improved considerably on a sequential basis. From the mid-teen declines we experienced in the second and third quarters, this quarter we finished the quarter down 5%. While our core U.S. metrology business continued to experience COVID-19 related softness, the largest decline is related to the timing of project deployments. 
Large-scale projects that were in process pre pandemic in both the U.S. and the Middle East have been completed. And new projects, which are part of our backlog, have been temporarily delayed due to site access restrictions. We expect that large project deployments will resume towards the end of the second quarter and further accelerate in the back half of the year. These declines were partly offset by high single-digit growth in our analytics and advanced digital solutions businesses.
Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits for the reasons I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down double digits due to the timing of prior year project deployments in the Middle East. And Europe grew double digits from demand in the test business and from the start of the Anglian Water metrology project in the U.K. Segment operating income and EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 330 and 350 basis points, respectively. Lower volume, inflation and unfavorable mix were partially offset by strong productivity and cost discipline.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. I was particularly pleased with our strong cash performance for the year. We grew free cash flow by 5% for the full year, exceeding our pre-pandemic free cash flow outlook, and delivered free cash flow conversion of 181%. Our team has been focused on driving continuous improvement on working capital for a number of years. In the difficult operating environment of 2020, they took that work another step forward, finishing at 17.6% of revenue. This is a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts, and reflects the team's progress in managing inventories and driving solid improvements in accounts receivable collections.
We benefited from favorable timing related to the settlement of restructuring, tax, interest and payroll liabilities, some of which will reverse in 2021. Our balance sheet is well positioned and includes a $1.9 billion cash balance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x. As a reminder, we'll take advantage of our cash position to repay one of our senior notes amounting to $600 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we announced an annual dividend increase of 8%. This is our tenth consecutive annual increase.
Please turn to Page 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to look forward at 2021."

When COVID first began to spread around the world, we said we would focus on managing what we could control, while maintaining our investment for growth. And that's exactly what we've done. So with 2021 still presenting some uncertainty, we will apply the same kind of focus that guided us throughout 2020. 
In our earnings call almost exactly a year ago, I said that I expected operational discipline would be a key capability for us. I couldn't have anticipated then how much we could benefit from that capability. When 2020's big challenges arrived, the team delivered on cost, on working capital, on free cash flow and on driving commercial value from our large installed base. We're still in a challenging environment, so we'll continue to face spending until we further see improvement in our markets. We'll keep executing the structural cost program begun in 2020, which is going to deliver savings through 2021. 
And given some of the inflationary headwinds we're already seeing, we are redoubling our efforts to manage the price-cost dynamic. We're keeping a very close eye on our supply chains, and proactively managing potential inflationary and logistics impacts. Despite varying by market and geography, there are clearly opportunities for growth in a recovering environment. In digital transformation, the pandemic demonstrated the imperative of operational and financial resilience for utilities, which is precisely the value proposition of our advanced digital solutions. 
Pre-pandemic, the business case was already very compelling. But as utility operators worked heroically to keep essential services running, the stresses of the pandemic made it clear that new approaches are required. Remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly continue to see increased demand. Backlog in our advanced digital solutions grew 70% year-on-year. Although it's from a small base, the trajectory is clear. It puts us in a very attractive position as we grow not only in software platforms, but in all of the digitally enabled parts of our portfolio.
Geographically, India and China will continue to drive high growth. Despite experiencing COVID's earliest impacts, China actually grew last year. And in the 3 years leading up to 2020, India and China posed a combined average annual growth rates in the double digits. With localization strategies well advanced in both countries, our China and India teams are set to continue delivering impressive growth.
It's also worth mentioning a very solid financial foundation underpinning our growth. With the current cash balance of nearly $1.9 billion, capital deployment is clearly top of mind for us. Even with some debt repayment during the fourth quarter, that number still offers a lot of capacity. Alongside organic investment, M&A remains a top priority, and we intend to be proactive in our deployment of capital, wherever the investment case warrants. We remain disciplined about valuations, but we do see opportunity for additional investments over the next 18 months. 
Growth is also important to our creation of social value. We are in the very privileged position that sustainability is baked into our business model and strategy. Our portfolio of solutions has a net positive impact, not only on water, but on a wide range of sustainability outcomes. We took several bold steps on sustainability in 2020, most notably, our green bond offering. And performance across these metrics continues to put us in a unique leadership position, both in the water sector and more broadly.
The team's progress has strengthened our position on a number of sustainability indices. We were recently added to Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index. Despite that gratifying recognition, we have so much more work to do to achieve our 2025 sustainability goals and to deliver on our mission.
I'm now going to turn it over to Sandy to provide end market and segment outlook."
118218449,692432990,2192081,"Xylem Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020, utilities have been reassuringly resilient, down only mid-single digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results, M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still, our outlook for 2021 reflects",963,"Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020, utilities have been reassuringly resilient, down only mid-single digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results, M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still, our outlook for 2021 reflects a tempered view that utilities have not seen the end of the pandemic impacts quite yet. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues, will grow in the low to mid-single digits in 2021. We expect that same growth rate on the wastewater side as utilities continue to focus on mission-critical applications. And we expect modest recovery in OpEx growth on a global basis through the year.
In the U.S., wastewater CapEx is likely to be down modestly. However, the decline should reflect postponements rather than reductions in projects. As you would expect, we have kept close to our utility customers to understand how they are thinking about budgets and funding for this year. And while some uncertainty remains, their deepest concerns have largely abated since the low point of the pandemic. On the clean water side, we anticipate mid single-digit growth. As I mentioned, large project deployments should begin ramping again from the second quarter, accelerating through the end of the year. The large multiyear metrology deals that we won in 2020 set us up for solid growth this year and beyond.
In industrial markets, we've seen good sequential improvement. Short-cycle orders and project activity are definitely beginning to pick up, but are still likely to be limited by COVID impacts in the near term. We expect industrial to be flattish to up low single digits. Our commercial end market outlook varies quite a bit by geography. The U.S. will continue to be sluggish. Europe, on the other hand, should continue recovering, although not at the double-digit pace we saw in the fourth quarter. And overall, we anticipate the commercial market to be flattish to down slightly for the year.
On Slide 12, you will see that we are reinstating annual guidance. While uncertainty remains especially regarding the timing and cadence of recovery, we are confident our team will deliver results in line with the following framework. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: low to mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, with solid growth in wastewater utilities being partially offset by flattish performance in the industrial markets, predominantly in our dewatering business; low single-digit growth in Applied Water. 
While we see pockets of recovery in this segment globally, particularly in residential, the outlook for growth in the commercial building end market is more muted. On top of that, our exposure to North America is heavier and the region has lagged on pandemic recovery. In Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect mid- single-digit growth. Customers indicate project deployments will likely resume late in the second quarter and further accelerate through the second half of the year. We also expect to see our test assessment services and advanced digital solutions businesses, building on the momentum they delivered finishing 2020.
While we have typically provided you with both the adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the past, you will notice that we are increasing our focus in reporting around adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this measure more accurately reflects the cash performance of our businesses and will enable us to more transparently report margin performance after M&A without purchase accounting impacts. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 40 to 140 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we're also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we expect to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, up 70 to 170 basis points. 
This predominantly reflects the benefits from our restructuring savings, combined with volume leverage and favorable price/mix, more than offsetting inflation and investments. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.60, an increase of 14% to 26%. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be in the range of 80% to 90%, following free cash flow conversion of 181% in 2020 and 124% in 2019. While we continue to drive continuous improvement, we expect to see increases in working capital as we return to growth, and some of the timing benefits we realized in 2020 related to the settlement of liabilities will reverse in 2021.
We believe this is purely a dynamic related to 2021, and we expect to drive 100% cash conversion in 2022 and beyond. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. One key item that I do want to draw your attention to is foreign exchange. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. FX can be volatile, and so an FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix, which will help you if we continue to see variations in the rates.
Now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate that total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This includes low single-digit growth in Applied Water and low to mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure. M&CS is expected to decline low to mid-single digits as we anticipate continuing delays from COVID before projects begin to deployment in Q2. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%, representing 170 to 270 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, with the largest expansion coming from M&CS due to operational improvements and a prior year warranty charge.
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

So it's not just about the artist known as Xylem Vue in our digital revenue. It's also the impact that has on pulling through other deals. Houston being a good example of that. We talked about Columbus, Winston-Salem late last year. So we're taking a broader view on this theme than just the digital revenue component. It really is the impact it has on our broader portfolio."

Also think your work is never done around continuous improvement. And so there certainly is opportunity for us to continue to drive margin expansion, whether it's through conversion cost projects, further optimizing our footprint. There's opportunity there.
Turning to your question on working capital. I think that the team did a terrific job on that this year. In years where your revenue growth declines, it's difficult to make improvements on a percentage basis. And the team did a super job on collections, bringing down our past dues. And we need to shout out and recognize our operations team on how they effectively managed and controlled inventory. So as we return to growth next year, working capital will be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to then continue to drive continuous improvement initiatives, whether it's scaling our -- some of our financing programs with our suppliers and other efforts. But I think we're exiting in a pretty good spot there."

Let me try to break it down for you in a couple of different pieces. So I'll start with restructuring. This year, we did take aggressive restructuring actions, and we realized about $70 million of savings from those structural programs. As we look forward into 2021, we're expecting a similar level. We have some further programs in Europe that haven't been completed yet, both related to footprint migration as well as overall efficiencies. But we do certainly expect to get those done in 2021, and that will help us from a year-over-year perspective.
Discretionary costs is another bucket that we are focused on. And as we look year-over-year, we took about $60 million of costs out from discretionary categories like travel and entertainment, services, marketing, et cetera. And our 2021 plan contemplates that about 40% of those costs will return. And then I would say that the third part of your question, you're starting to touch on inflation, which is probably the most challenging part of the equation. As you know, we saw a very stable inflationary environment for most of 2020. We did start to see that pick up at the end of 2020, and we're seeing that pressure continue in 2021. Our teams have gotten a little bit in front of that. So we have announced price actions that have been implemented in the first quarter.

We've got a very strong and proven procurement team, and they are in lockstep with our commercial teams on making sure that we've got that highlighted. So again, as Sandy said, we're already using pricing actions. The impacts are different across each one of the segments based upon the impact on commodities.

We talked about resuming CapEx to be more in line with historical levels. And I think the third one is more unique to 2020 and 2021. And that is there were a number of liability categories that we benefited from the timing on, and that benefit was about $75 million in 2020. 2/3 of that will reverse next year.

We announced earlier this morning that our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations on orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies.
Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter, with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets. Orders were up double digits in all 3 of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically. Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year-on-year, and with momentum up strong sequentially.
U.S. demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%. Alongside top line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion. I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020. Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Therefore, we are raising our full year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS.
I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter."

The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets. Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year, with performance better than our expectations across the board. Strong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery. Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%. I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%.
Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all 3 business segments contributed double-digit order gains. Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement.
Looking at the key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%. The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%.
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%. And geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year. The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance. EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation.
Please turn to Slide 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe. Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies. Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets. By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential. Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior year COVID shutdowns as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margin grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively. The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity.
And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects. Segment backlog is up 29%. As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement, but finished flat year-on-year. Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business. In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half.
Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively. Modest price realization and strong productivity savings as well as a prior year warranty charge more than offset inflation.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations as well as our historical seasonality patterns. Managing working capital remains an enterprise-wide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6x at the end of the quarter.
Now please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."
118218449,711222996,2268318,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already",792,"Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already heard about our emerging markets teams exceptional first quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively. Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight. In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth. But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us. Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in Water Infrastructure. And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher growth nations continue to urbanize. We expect emerging markets overall will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.
The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy. Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated endpoints. Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic. We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio. In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks. All of these projects deliver network-as-a-service, software-as-a-service and advanced analytics. In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning. And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with ESRI. ESRI is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short. These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment. By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability. And with last week's agreement, Xylem and ESRI are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together. Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world. We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together.
Turning next to operating discipline. Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations. As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost. And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions. In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation. The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%.
Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover. That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors. Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation. Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time.
The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability. I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020. However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability. As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our Signature 2025 sustainability goals. We'll be those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June. We'll be reporting, for example, that in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways. Now the report is largely retrospective, but of course, we continue to move forward.
In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance. It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives. Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team. That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose.
With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year."
118218449,711222996,2268318,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck.

Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck. The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes. First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits.
On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and OpEx needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there.
On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again. Before I move on from utilities, let me briefly touch on the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan. We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure. More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets. We are encouraged by those possibilities. But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations.
Please turn to Slide 11. The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market. We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all 3 of our business segments. We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth. And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares. Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals. And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year.
Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged. We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits. We are gaining share in Europe on healthy demand, and the U.S. replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021.
In residential, we now anticipate high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half due largely to prior year comparisons.
Now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid to high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from low to mid single-digit growth previously; mid to high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single-digit growth; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid single-digit growth. While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges.
For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points. This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation. Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year.
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward. Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment.
We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, and therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix.
Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%. This includes high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low teens growth in Applied Water and mid-single digits growth in M&CS. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year.
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

Xylem is clearly in a strong position coming out of Q1, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and beyond. Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth. Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion. And a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy. More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today. The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever. Not only it is critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity. From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future. In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term.
We look forward to providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our next Investor Day, which is currently planned for September 30. It will most likely be a combined virtual and physical format, but we do hope to host as many of you as possible COVID restrictions permitting. Matt and the team will follow up with more details as soon as they're pinned down. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have. So operator, please lead us into Q&A."

And so really building off of that long-term partnership, but really expanding now across the rest of our portfolio that is sold into the utility. So it really is about harnessing the power of the geographical data that ESRI has -- they've got a very large share base of utilities around the world. This is not limited to a U.S. opportunity. We think that the power of the collective. I know they are very, very excited about working with us because what they don't have right now -- we don't have access to the weather data they do. At the same time, they don't have the deep subject matter expertise of being able to advise the utility on how to use this data to go address pipeline issues or water treatment plan issues, whatever challenges that utility may be facing and that's what they're looking for us to really bring in. And they see it's the power and breadth of our portfolio since we're not limited on a few offerings in terms of equipment. The case study example of the 1 utility that we talked about in the Mid-Atlantic, we help them reduce their non-revenue water through a 4x reduction in pipe failures. And that 1 project is going to end up cutting their pipe replacement cost by $70 million. On the commercial side of the relationship, I'd rather not get into details on that right now.

So it's not limited to treatment or transport or utilities even -- part of that is, again, there has been improvement in China in terms of side access, kind of an opening up more broadly of the economy. And so we see that investment flowing. From a long-term perspective, there really are -- we see a couple of key drivers here. The whole focus on sustainability and environmental impact by the central government there, which has been part of their long-range plan for a while now, is driving real investment, and we see that in our bidding pipeline and our project backlog. Secondly, it is really being driven also, from a competitive standpoint, by all of the work that we've done over the number of years to localize our supply chain as well as strengthening our engineering capabilities on the ground there and our selling capabilities.

I think first of all, when we went out with our guidance for the full year of 2021, we did expect that the margin expansion would be stronger first half, second half. And there's multiple reasons for that. So starting with the restructuring actions that we took in 2020, we realized about $70 million of restructuring and structural cost benefit last year. About $50 million of that was in the back half of the year. And we're calling for about $60 million of restructuring savings in 2021, and that will be more front-end loaded. So 2/3 of that should come in the first half. So you have a little bit of a difference from a timing perspective on the restructuring side. And then the other thing is some of our discretionary costs. We took out about $60 million of discretionary costs last year. And in our plan, we have about 40% of that returning. That actually was a tailwind for us in Q1 because we've had travel and other items going on last year in Q1. That will start to flip in the second half of the year and become a headwind. And the other area, I think that it's really important is, we've strategically staggered the timing and phase, the timing of our investments. And so those are to support our growth platform. So things like building out our digital platform, continuing to -- we just talked about the emerging markets. We're expanding our channel in the emerging markets. We're continuing to focus on localization. And so those investments will come in higher in the second half of the year. And I think the new thing is that inflation and -- has continued to tick up. And while we're taking pricing actions, they don't always perfectly offset from a timing perspective. And certainly, we're watching the supply chain constraints closely."

So I don't consider them being boring. But I know that's a bit tongue and shake on your part. The -- but if we think about our -- kind of our core businesses over the history of Xylem, we continue to invest organically in those businesses, and we've done some small tuck-in bolt-ons like in treatment, et cetera, as well. But we're increasing that investment in the second half of the year to where about 2/3 of the investment that we're going to be making in the second half is weighted towards kind of the core equipment product offerings that we need to do. The remainder really being in more the digital side.
From an M&A standpoint, we are open. We evaluate opportunities across the spectrum for each one of our businesses in this segment because, hereby, it's really important that we maintain and extend our market share leadership in those businesses and not be purely fixated on just what's going on within M&CS. So that's a big theme across the company right now.
In terms of the dynamics of slower ramp in top line growth and margin expansion in M&CS. I know we said this before, and you began to see that here in the first quarter. That really is a function of timing. I mean as these large deals begin to get deployed over the course of this year, second half and then next year and beyond, you're going to see that turn, especially when we look at it from an EBITDA standpoint relative to the rest of Xylem."

And then my second one was, again, another big picture question, Patrick. You're an important kind of voice in this industry. And I want to get your response to something as it relates to federal dollars, right? So we've seen some great progress in the last decade on full cost pricing by local water systems. We've seen great progress on consolidation and acquisitions by investor-owned players who are great customers for you, as you've demonstrated in your past Analyst Day's and so forth. So my question is, to what extent does a big infusion of sort of no strings attached to federal money into that sector put those sustainable drivers of full cost progress and consolidation at risk? In other words, you throw a lifeline, they don't have to increase price, they can even lower price, they don't have to sell through investor-owned. What are your thoughts on that and the risks associated with federal money coming in, in a big way?"

And the answer right now is no one really knows because nothing has been approved yet. But I think directionally, as you well know, historically, CapEx in the U.S. water utility space, which is really what we're talking about is more on the CapEx side, has not been funded by federal legislation. And so if this pilot money comes through -- I mean quite frankly, on a relative basis, right now, the number is around $110 billion, I believe. That to me personally is underwhelming relative to the price tag of the rest of infrastructure was being kicked around. And so I think by the time you spread that out across the utilities in the states or at a local level, I don't think it's going to put as much pressure on utilities, as you pointed out. Moving away from otherwise progress they would be forced to make to protect their investments. So we'll see when we get there. That's not the rumbling that we're getting. I mean we stay close, for example, to NACA, which you will know is the North American Clean Water Association. And that's one of the questions we ask of those large utility players, is what do they think about the proposed bill? They're encouraged, but they're not making any plans based on it right now.

There is a reminder that we've got this $600 million note that's due in early Q4. So we -- that's not going to constrain us. But as you all are modeling cash and balance sheet, just make sure that you keep that in mind."

The",249,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We announced earlier this morning that our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations on orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies.
Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter, with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets. Orders were up double digits in all 3 of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically. Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year-on-year and with momentum up strong sequentially. U.S. demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%.
Alongside top line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion. I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020. Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Therefore, we are raising our full year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS.
I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter."
118218449,711222996,2268503,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Patrick.

The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets. Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year, with performance better than our expectations across the board. Strong double-digit revenue growth in Wastewater Utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery. Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%. I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, Utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial up 5%; and residential was up 31%.
Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all 3 business segments contributed double-digit order gains. Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement.
Looking at the key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%. The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%.
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%. Geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year. The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance. EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation.
Please turn to Slide 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe. Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies. Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets. By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential. Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior year COVID shutdowns as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively. The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity.
And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects. Segment backlog is up 29%. As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement, but finished flat year-on-year. Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business. In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half.
Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively. Modest price realization and strong productivity savings as well as a prior year warranty charge more than offset inflation.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations as well as our historical seasonality patterns. Managing working capital remains an enterprise-wide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6x at the end of the quarter.
Now please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."
118218449,711222996,2268503,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already",799,"Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already heard about our emerging markets team's exceptional first quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively. Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight.
In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth. But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us. Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in Water Infrastructure. And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher growth nations continue to urbanize. We expect emerging markets overall will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.
The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy. Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated endpoints. Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic. We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio.
In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks. All of these projects deliver Network as a Service, Software as a Service and advanced analytics. In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning. And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with Esri.
Esri is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short. These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment. By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability. And with last week's agreement, Xylem and Esri are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together. Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world. We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together.
Turning next to operating discipline. Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations. As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost. And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions. In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation. The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%.
Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover. That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors. Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation. Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time.
The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability. I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020. However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability.
As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our signature 2025 sustainability goals. We'll be highlighting those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June. We'll be reporting, for example, that in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways. Now the report is largely retrospective, but, of course, we continue to move forward.
In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance. It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives. Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team. That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose.
With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year."
118218449,711222996,2268503,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick.

Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck. The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes. First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits.
On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and OpEx needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there. On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again.
Before I move on from utilities, let me briefly touch on the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan. We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure. More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets. We are encouraged by those possibilities. But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations.
Please turn to Slide 11. The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market. We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all 3 of our business segments. We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth. And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares. Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals. And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year.
Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged. We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits. We are gaining share in Europe on healthy demand, and the U.S. replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021.
In residential, we now anticipate high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half due largely to prior year comparisons.
Now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid- to high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from low to mid-single-digit growth previously; mid- to high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single-digit growth; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth. While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges.
For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be at 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points. This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation. Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year.
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward. Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment.
We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile and, therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix.
Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%. This includes high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low teens growth in Applied Water and mid-single-digits growth in M&CS. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year.
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth. Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion. And a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy. More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today.
The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever. Not only is it critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity. From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future. In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term.

So on the -- in terms of what problem are we trying to solve for here, particularly with the utilities, we already had some of our businesses working with Esri. That was our pipeline condition assessment business, the artist formally known as Pure as well as Wachs Water, which does a lot of the kind of valve pipe replacement work for utilities. And so really building off of that long-term partnership, but really expanding now across the rest of our portfolio that is sold into the utility.
So it really is about harnessing the power of the geographical data that Esri has -- they've got a very large share base of utilities around the world. This is not limited to a U.S. opportunity. We think that the power of the collective. I know they are very, very excited about working with us because what they don't have right now -- we don't have access to the weather data they do. At the same time, they don't have the deep subject matter expertise of being able to advise the utility on how to use this data to go address pipeline issues or water treatment plan issues, whatever challenges that utility may be facing and that's what they're looking for us to really bring in.
And they see it's the power and breadth of our portfolio since we're not limited on a few offerings in terms of equipment. The case study example of the one utility that we talked about in the Mid-Atlantic, we help them reduce their nonrevenue water buying through a 4x reduction in pipe failures. And that one project is going to end up cutting their pipe replacement cost by $70 million. On the commercial side of the relationship, I'd rather not get into details on that right now. We can perhaps cover that maybe at our Investor Day later in the year."

From a long-term perspective, there really are -- we see a couple of key drivers here. The whole focus on sustainability and environmental impact by the central government there, which has been part of their long-range plan for a while now, is driving real investment. And we see that in our bidding pipeline and our project backlog.

I think first of all, when we went out with our guidance for the full year of 2021, we did expect that the margin expansion would be stronger first half, second half. And there's multiple reasons for that. So starting with the restructuring actions that we took in 2020, we realized about $70 million of restructuring and structural cost benefit last year. About $50 million of that was in the back half of the year. And we're calling for about $60 million of restructuring savings in 2021, and that will be more front-end loaded. So 2/3 of that should come in the first half. So you have a little bit of a difference from a timing perspective on the restructuring side.
And then the other thing is some of our discretionary costs. We took out about $60 million of discretionary costs last year. And in our plan, we have about 40% of that returning. That actually was a tailwind for us in Q1 because we've had travel and other items going on last year in Q1. That will start to flip in the second half of the year and become a headwind. And the other area, I think that it's really important is, we've strategically staggered the timing and phase, the timing of our investments. And so those are to support our growth platform.
So things like building out our digital platform, continuing to -- we just talked about the emerging markets. We're expanding our channel in the emerging markets. We're continuing to focus on localization. And so those investments will come in higher in the second half of the year. And I think the new thing is that inflation and -- has continued to tick up. And while we're taking pricing actions, they don't always perfectly offset from a timing perspective. And certainly, we're watching the supply chain constraints closely."

So we will make the investment, and we'll lease it back to them. It does address the affordability issues for the utility for the customer. But that's not the only model we do.

From an M&A standpoint, we are open. We evaluate opportunities across the spectrum for each one of our businesses in this segment because, hereby, it's really important that we maintain and extend our market share leadership in those businesses and not be purely fixated on just what's going on within M&CS. So that's a big theme across the company right now.
In terms of the dynamics of slower ramp in top line growth and margin expansion in M&CS, I know we said this before. And you began to see that here in the first quarter.

We've seen great progress on consolidation and acquisitions by investor-owned players who are great customers for you, as you've demonstrated in your past Analyst Day's and so forth.
So my question is, to what extent does a big infusion of sort of no strings attached to federal money into that sector put those sustainable drivers of full cost progress and consolidation at risk? In other words, you throw a lifeline, they don't have to increase price, they can even lower price, they don't have to sell through investor-owned.

And the answer right now is no one really knows because nothing has been approved yet. But I think directionally, as you well know, historically, CapEx in the U.S. water utility space, which is really what we're talking about, is more on the CapEx side, has not been funded by federal legislation. And so if this pilot money comes through, I mean quite frankly, on a relative basis, right now, the number is around $110 billion, I believe. That to me personally is underwhelming relative to the price tag of the rest of infrastructure was being kicked around.
And so I think by the time you spread that out across the utilities in the states or at a local level, I don't think it's going to put as much pressure on utilities, as you pointed out. Moving away from otherwise progress, they would be forced to make to protect their investments. So we'll see when we get there. That's not the rumbling that we're getting. I mean we stay close, for example, to NACWA, which, you will know, is the North American Clean Water Association. And that's one of the questions we ask of those large utility players, is what do they think about the proposed bill.

We saw nice momentum in both businesses. Matt can share the detailed numbers. But really good look at bidding activity on the digital side, order growth, backlog growth, margins, strong incremental margins on that business.

They both are kind of on target for what our plan was. That will ramp. We're seeing good activity, good interest, bidding around both of the businesses. Some good orders, good momentum on the BU side. And we'll have more to share about that, digital strategy and the component that is view at Investor Day.
But I think importantly, too, it's also their synergies with that view business into other parts of the business. And so for example, we highlighted that Greensboro win that we had this quarter. And that is an AMI deployment, but it also comes with some digital components in terms of pipeline condition assessment service, on the Wachs Water piece. So it addresses nonrevenue water. And also our Valor Analytics technology that goes at the meters that need to be replaced and targeted first to address. So both of those are in that deal.

But the situation on the electronics components is very, very dynamic. And so we want to continue to monitor and see how that plays out over the next few months. And we've taken extra inventory where it was possible. It takes a little bit of time to substitute parts out and get those certified, but that's something that our team is also working on.

In terms of valuation, we have seen some multiple inflation there, but really tends to be around things in the digital space of scale. We've not been actively participating in some of those deals that have been announced here recently because we like the portfolio that we've got. But we're always in the game on those in terms of looking at it. But we do want to be disciplined on valuation.

The call is starting a bit later in the morning than usual this quarter. So by now, you will have seen that second quarter performance exceeded our expectations on all major metrics, including orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. I'm very beating the healthy pace we set in the first quarter and to delivering a very strong first half of the year. 
Underlying demand for our solutions was robust across all segments and end markets and [indiscernible] did a great job converting that into better-than-expected performance and continuing to expand margin. They delivered even more exceptional results on orders, which grew 29% on an underlying demand across all regions. In addition, backlog is up 35% versus this point last year. That broad expansion reflects commercial momentum that puts us in a strong position, both now and into the future as we continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
At the end of the first quarter, we raised full year guidance on revenue and earnings. The second quarter's performance shows a continuing strong trajectory into the second half, and we're reflecting that by further raising full year revenue guidance. The top line benefits are likely to be moderated somewhat by inflation and a challenging supply chain environment. But we've been proactive on price and are working with our supply chain partners to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. So we are also raising the midpoint on earnings per share guidance for the full year. In a moment, I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing globally. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter."
118218449,1673836585,2360755,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Patrick.

The second quarter offered a strong story of continuing demand recovery as revenue grew 11% organically compared to the prior year. We also saw momentum across most end markets on a quarter sequential basis. 
Utilities, our largest end market, was up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by clean water applications and continued wastewater utility OpEx demand. Industrial was up 17% on broad-based strength as economies reopened and activity continued to ramp. Commercial grew 12% and also improved sequentially, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. While residential, our smallest end market, grew 29%. Geographically, Western Europe and China were both up mid-teens with increasing demand seen across all end markets. The U.S. returned to growth with site access restrictions easing during the quarter. 
As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 29% on strong underlying demand across all segments and regions, with particular pace in M&CS, which grew orders 70% on large water metrology contracts. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential order improvement and reflects higher orders growth than in the same period in 2019. Importantly, we exit the quarter with overall backlog up 35%. 
Looking at the key financial metrics, margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.3%. The 200 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion came largely from productivity, volume and favorable mix, partially offset by inflation and investments. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, which is up 65%.  
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure delivered strong results during the quarter. Orders were flat, but up 22%, excluding the large prior year deal in Telangana India, order intake was robust in treatment globally. Revenues were up 6% organically. Wastewater Utilities remained resilient, and we are now seeing recovery in the industrial end markets. 
Geographically, emerging markets delivered mid-teens growth from industrial recovery, driven in part by increasing mining demand in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe delivered double-digit growth from continued strong utility OpEx activity. In the U.S., healthy utilities OpEx demand reflected in strong orders growth was offset by the lapping of prior year treatment project delivery. EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year as strong productivity savings and volume effects offset inflation and investments. 
Now please turn to Slide 6. The Applied Water segment had a very strong quarter, driven by continuing market recovery across all regions and end markets. Orders were up 43% organically in the quarter, with particular strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenue grew 18% in the quarter with double-digit industrial demand driven by reopening activity and especially in marine and food and beverage applications. Residential growth continues to be robust and strong market demand. 
Geographically, the U.S. was up double digits, while Western Europe contributed 27% growth on increasing industrial demand. Emerging markets were up 24%, due in part to broad industrial recovery and momentum in China. Segment EBITDA margin grew 200 basis points compared to the prior year. The expansion came from strong volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting material and freight inflation. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. M&CS delivered a strong quarter as large project deployments began to ramp. We also realized gains in our industrial water quality testing business. Orders for the segment were up 70% organically on strong demand. Our M&CS backlog now stands at $1.5 billion, which is a historic high and almost 50% higher than at this time last year. We have secured more than $400 million in large contracts in the last 18 months. That reflects a number of major projects, which increasingly include our broader digital solutions in combination with our core metrology applications. 
Revenue was up 11%, led by 17% growth in water applications, driven by large project deployments and double-digit growth in water quality applications. Energy applications were down modestly due to project timing and supply chain constraints. 
Unpacking the results by geography, emerging markets in Western Europe were up 20% and 25%, respectively. The U.S. was up mid-single digits on strong demand for water quality applications and assessment services. As a reminder, for this segment in particular, growth rates can be uneven due to the impact of project timing. 
Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was up 460 basis points compared to the prior year. Strong productivity savings from prior year restructuring actions favorable mix and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, $600 million of senior notes will mature to be paid with cash. Free cash flow conversion was 172% in the quarter, in line with our expectations and historical seasonality patterns. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."

Our operating discipline, our growth platforms and sustainability. On operating discipline, the team did an excellent job on margins in the quarter, delivering 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion year-on-year in addition to quarter sequential improvement. We do anticipate some inflation and component supply challenges in the second half, but we're confident in our ability to manage through them and to mitigate their impact. 
Earlier, I noted our extremely healthy backlog. As we work through these volumes, the team is doing a great job making sure we manage the pressure on working capital this can create. In fact, despite serving spiking demand, we've improved working capital both year-over-year and quarter sequentially. As Sandy just mentioned, that performance puts us firmly on track to deliver our commitment on attractive free cash flow conversion. 
We clearly have significant capacity for capital deployment. On top of strong organic growth investment options, we have an attractive and active pipeline of M&A opportunities. Our growth platforms are an area we'll be delving into at our Investor Day in September, so I'm going to refrain from too much detail here today. I do want to draw attention to 2 things, however. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the pace of growth in emerging markets. This quarter, that pace has continued, despite India's hard acceleration through the quarter due to COVID impact there. I'm very proud of the entire Xylem team's discipline and compassionate response in all countries affected by COVID, both in terms of our own operations and also how we've leaned in to support customers and help serve our communities. 
I also want to take a moment to draw a connecting line between our portfolio and some of the dramatic water-centric events we've been seeing recently around the world, by which I mean the flooding in Europe, China and Central Asia and the drought in American West. These events reflect a trend as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent. And that trend requires an affordable response to keep communities safe, resilient and water secure. So we continue to invest in specific technologies in our portfolio that respond to these challenges. 
As an example, automated wastewater network optimization is amongst our most advanced digital solutions. Its job is to manage overflows and prevent flooding. And our customer deployments are already preventing 1.4 billion cubic meters of water from flooding communities. Similarly, we also continue to innovate in the technologies that make communities more resilient to drought, technologies like leak detection, smart metering and especially water reuse. Already 1 trillion gallons of water are being recycled using Xylem technology, which brings me to the topic of sustainability more broadly. 
The numbers I just quoted come from our Annual Sustainability Report, which we published in June. And I think they bear out what we've said for some time. Our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our business strategy. We were pleased to report, for example, that almost half of our major facilities are now operating on 100% renewable energy, helping reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by more than 7% year-over-year. 
Beyond our own footprint, our solutions have enabled our customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 700,000 metric tons last year. The report details progress on all of our signature sustainability goals and shows how sustainability is deeply embedded in who we are as a company. Now with that, I'll hand it back over to Sandy to provide commentary on our end markets and guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both",988,"Thanks, Patrick. Our full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water, affirming our anticipated growth of mid- to high single digits. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady demand in Western Europe and North America as operators continue to focus on mission-critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets. Bid activity and long-term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid, though some COVID concerns linger in certain markets. 
On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery. Consistent with other technology companies, the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half, given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components. Our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year, we are now anticipated growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions. We're seeing upticks in demand, particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets. We're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage, driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. 
We are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well. The U.S. replacement business is growing at a first pace. New commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat, but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector. With growth in Western Europe and China sustained through the second half, along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency, we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid- to high single digits, up from the low single digits previously. In residential, we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year, up modestly from our previous expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. 
And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are further raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, up from our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. This confidence is based on clear demand recovery, combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation. 
This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For water infrastructure, we expect mid-single-digit growth from a previous expectation of mid- to high single digits. We expect low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid- to high single digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect mid-single-digit growth. We also expect EBITDA margins in the range of 17.2% to 17.7%.  
This guidance represents full year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint. That's grounded in a strong first half performance, with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year as well as volume leverage from the top line growth. The third quarter is more challenging, primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization. However, price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters. 
Overall, we expect strong second half margins compared to the first half of the year. This yields an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70, reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges. That range now reflects a 28% increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint over last year. 
We continue to expect full year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. 
However, 1 item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year. Because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results, we've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18. This change, along with some other currency movements has a $0.04 negative impact on our second half outlook. 
As you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Also, we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from $50 million to $60 million to now $30 million to $40 million, while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to high natural attrition and the timing of actions. 
And now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our third quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5% to 7%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water and low single-digit growth in M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, largely in line with our strong second quarter. While inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter, we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments."

We expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand. And the team will manage through the near-term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year. 
Looking forward, trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand-in-hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way. Those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis, that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies, addressing scarcity, resilience and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins, and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment. 
This puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term. We are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our upcoming Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 30. It will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team, especially those who joined us over the past year. So it's a great chance to provide a full strategic update, including our long-term financial targets, and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers, including discussions with a few of those customers who've deployed some of our most advanced technologies. Matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days.

The day-to-day business grew quite nicely in the quarter, and we see good momentum there. We feel that the site access issues have certainly eased. I wouldn't say they're completely resolved, but they're certainly trending in the right direction. Where we're really seeing -- and really, the primary challenge out there right now, which the team is all over working hard to mitigate that is some of the component shortages. And that's not limited to us. That really is not just across our sector, but as you all well know, broader sectors as well. But the team is all over. We're doing everything we can, whether it be kind of paying up for some components, making sure we lock in commitments around that. So we're very -- we feel very good about the momentum. It really does feel like that part of our business is turning the corner in terms of converting things into backlog. We look at the margin in backlog, especially as we go into 2022 and feel very good about that, not just what they've achieved already this year. Again, challenges aside in the second half around component shortages, and those are real. They're not insignificant, but we're confident we can work through that.

And so we are getting better, I think, at pricing for value. I would say in these kinds of interesting environments, we were not really doing surcharges. So it's not like we're putting it out there where we have to dial it back later. And so we're trying to be disciplined in that regard. At the same time, we also dealt with this. It wasn't that long ago, we were talking about the tariffs and all the other interesting pricing challenges that we had to overcome. So again, I don't want to minimize the incredible hard work the teams are doing to deal with this pricing environment. But I'm very pleased and very proud of what they've accomplished thus far."

When you shift over and look at AWS and M&CS where I think we're up 43% in AWS in the quarter and 70% in M&CS there is true demand returning. But we are seeing customers try to get in line a little bit, whether it's ahead of longer lead times that we published, some incremental pricing actions that we've announced, or importantly, the supply chain components that we've talked about extensively on the call. All of that in combination is certainly impacting some of the buying behaviors.

We've -- the -- really, I mean, despite the sharp deceleration in India in the quarter because of the Delta variant there, we still saw very strong growth in emerging markets collectively. China, most notably, but Eastern Europe and others are performing extremely well. So we're keeping a close eye. But again, we really haven't seen any meaningful impact as of now on the Delta variant."

Certainly, second half of this year and onward, we will continue to look at and do bolt-ons and tuck-ins from a technology standpoint to round out that utility offering and feel very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline there. We've talked a lot in the past about industrial. And certainly, that continues to be something we're very interested in and we've got an active pipeline there. As I always say, it takes 2 to tango. And so we can't control the timing of when these things happen, but we continue to cultivate those opportunities. And then there are other verticals, I mean, in commercial and resi and ag that we certainly keep on our radar screen to look at. So we feel good about the pipeline.

We're going to continue to remain disciplined on valuation. And as I mentioned earlier to one of the earlier questions, we certainly are open to using our stock as a currency, where it makes sense.

The call is starting a bit later in the morning than usual this quarter. So by now, you will have seen that second quarter performance exceeded our expectations on all major metrics, including orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. I'm very proud beating the healthy pace we set in the first quarter and to delivering a very strong first half of the year. 
Underlying demand for our solutions was robust across all segments and end markets. Our team did a great job converting that into better-than-expected performance and continuing to expand margin. They delivered even more exceptional results on orders, which grew 29% on an underlying demand across all regions. In addition, backlog is up 35% versus this point last year. That broad expansion reflects commercial momentum that puts us in a strong position, both now and into the future as we continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
At the end of the first quarter, we raised full year guidance on revenue and earnings. The second quarter's performance shows a continuing strong trajectory into the second half, and we're reflecting that by further raising full year revenue guidance. The top line benefits are likely to be moderated somewhat by inflation and a challenging supply chain environment. But we've been proactive on price and are working with our supply chain partners to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. So we are also raising the midpoint on earnings per share guidance for the full year. In a moment, I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing globally. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter."
118218449,1673836585,2361010,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Patrick.

The second quarter offered a strong story of continuing demand recovery as revenue grew 11% organically compared to the prior year. We also saw momentum across most end markets on a quarter sequential basis. 
Utilities, our largest end market, was up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by clean water applications and continued wastewater utility OpEx demand. Industrial was up 17% on broad-based strength as economies reopened and activity continued to ramp. Commercial grew 12% and also improved sequentially, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. While residential, our smallest end market, grew 29%. Geographically, Western Europe and China were both up mid-teens with increasing demand seen across all end markets. The U.S. returned to growth with site access restrictions easing during the quarter. 
As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 29% on strong underlying demand across all segments and regions, with particular pace in M&CS, which grew orders 70% on large water metrology contracts. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement and reflects higher orders growth than in the same period in 2019. Importantly, we exit the quarter with overall backlog up 35%. 
Looking at the key financial metrics, margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.3%. The 200 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion came largely from productivity, volume and favorable mix, partially offset by inflation and investments. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, which is up 65%.  
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure delivered strong results during the quarter. Orders were flat, but up 22%, excluding the large prior year deal in Telangana, India, order intake was robust in treatment globally. Revenues were up 6% organically. Wastewater Utilities remained resilient, and we are now seeing recovery in the industrial end markets. 
Geographically, emerging markets delivered mid-teens growth from industrial recovery, driven in part by increasing mining demand in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe delivered double-digit growth from continued strong utility OpEx activity. In the U.S., healthy utilities OpEx demand, reflected in strong orders growth, was offset by the lapping of prior year treatment project delivery. EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year as strong productivity savings and volume effects offset inflation and investments. 
Now please turn to Slide 6. The Applied Water segment had a very strong quarter, driven by continuing market recovery across all regions and end markets. Orders were up 43% organically in the quarter, with particular strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenue grew 18% in the quarter with double-digit industrial demand driven by reopening activity and especially in marine and food and beverage applications. Residential growth continues to be robust and strong market demand. 
Geographically, the U.S. was up double digits, while Western Europe contributed 27% growth on increasing industrial demand. Emerging markets were up 24%, due in part to broad industrial recovery and momentum in China. Segment EBITDA margin grew 200 basis points compared to the prior year. The expansion came from strong volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting material and freight inflation. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. M&CS delivered a strong quarter as large project deployments began to ramp. We also realized gains in our industrial water quality testing business. Orders for the segment were up 70% organically on strong demand. Our M&CS backlog now stands at $1.5 billion, which is a historic high and almost 50% higher than at this time last year. We have secured more than $400 million in large contracts in the last 18 months. That reflects a number of major projects, which increasingly include our broader digital solutions in combination with our core metrology applications. 
Revenue was up 11%, led by 17% growth in water applications, driven by large project deployments and double-digit growth in water quality applications. Energy applications were down modestly due to project timing and supply chain constraints. 
Unpacking the results by geography, emerging markets in Western Europe were up 20% and 25%, respectively. The U.S. was up mid-single digits on strong demand for water quality applications and assessment services. As a reminder, for this segment in particular, growth rates can be uneven due to the impact of project timing. 
Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was up 460 basis points compared to the prior year. Strong productivity savings from prior year restructuring actions, favorable mix and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, $600 million of senior notes will mature to be paid with cash. Free cash flow conversion was 172% in the quarter, in line with our expectations and historical seasonality patterns. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."

Our operating discipline, our growth platforms and sustainability. On operating discipline, the team did an excellent job on margins in the quarter, delivering 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion year-on-year in addition to quarter sequential improvement. We do anticipate some inflation and component supply challenges in the second half, but we're confident in our ability to manage through them and to mitigate their impact. 
Earlier, I noted our extremely healthy backlogs. As we work through these volumes, the team is doing a great job making sure we manage the pressure on working capital this can create. In fact, despite serving spiking demand, we've improved working capital both year-over-year and quarter sequentially. As Sandy just mentioned, that performance puts us firmly on track to deliver our commitment on attractive free cash flow conversion. 
We clearly have significant capacity for capital deployment. On top of strong organic growth investment options, we have an attractive and active pipeline of M&A opportunities. Our growth platforms are an area we'll be delving into at our Investor Day in September, so I'm going to refrain from too much detail here today. I do want to draw attention to 2 things, however. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the pace of growth in emerging markets. This quarter, that pace has continued, despite India's hard acceleration through the quarter due to COVID impact there. I'm very proud of the entire Xylem team's discipline and compassionate response in all countries affected by COVID, both in terms of our own operations and also how we've leaned in to support customers and help serve our communities. 
I also want to take a moment to draw a connecting line between our portfolio and some of the dramatic water-centric events we've been seeing recently around the world, by which I mean the flooding in Europe, China and Central Asia and the drought in American West. These events reflect a trend as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent. And that trend requires an affordable response to keep communities safe, resilient and water secure. So we continue to invest in specific technologies in our portfolio that respond to these challenges. 
As an example, automated wastewater network optimization is amongst our most advanced digital solutions. Its job is to manage overflows and prevent flooding. And our customer deployments are already preventing 1.4 billion cubic meters of water from flooding communities. Similarly, we also continue to innovate in the technologies that make communities more resilient to drought, technologies like leak detection, smart metering and especially water reuse. Already, 1 trillion gallons of water are being recycled using Xylem technology, which brings me to the topic of sustainability more broadly. 
The numbers I just quoted come from our Annual Sustainability Report, which we published in June. And I think they bear out what we've said for some time. Our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our business strategy. We were pleased to report, for example, that almost half of our major facilities are now operating on 100% renewable energy, helping reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by more than 7% year-over-year. 
Beyond our own footprint, our solutions have enabled our customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 700,000 metric tons last year. The report details progress on all of our signature sustainability goals and shows how sustainability is deeply embedded in who we are as a company. Now with that, I'll hand it back over to Sandy to provide commentary on our end markets and guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both",988,"Thanks, Patrick. Our full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water, affirming our anticipated growth of mid- to high single digits. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady demand in Western Europe and North America as operators continue to focus on mission-critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets. Bid activity and long-term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid, though some COVID concerns linger in certain markets. 
On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery. Consistent with other technology companies, the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half, given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components. Our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year, we are now anticipating growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions. We're seeing upticks in demand, particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets. We're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage, driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. 
We are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well. The U.S. replacement business is growing at a brisk pace. New commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat, but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector. With growth in Western Europe and China sustained through the second half, along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency, we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid- to high single digits, up from the low single digits previously. In residential, we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year, up modestly from our previous expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to a more difficult year-over-year comparison. 
And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are further raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, up from our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. This confidence is based on clear demand recovery, combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation. 
This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For water infrastructure, we expect mid-single-digit growth from a previous expectation of mid- to high single digits. We expect low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid- to high single digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect mid-single-digit growth. We also expect EBITDA margins in the range of 17.2% to 17.7%.  
This guidance represents full year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint. That's grounded in a strong first half performance, with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year as well as volume leverage from the top line growth. The third quarter is more challenging, primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization. However, price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters. 
Overall, we expect strong second half margins compared to the first half of the year. This yields an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70, reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges. That range now reflects a 28% increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint over last year. 
We continue to expect full year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. 
However, 1 item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year. Because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results, we've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18. This change, along with some other currency movements has a $0.04 negative impact on our second half outlook. 
As you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Also, we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from $50 million to $60 million to now $30 million to $40 million, while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to higher natural attrition and the timing of actions. 
And now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our third quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5% to 7%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water and low single-digit growth in M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, largely in line with our strong second quarter. While inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter, we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments."

We expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand. And the team will manage through the near-term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year. 
Looking forward, trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand-in-hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way. Those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis, that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies, addressing scarcity, resilience and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins, and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment. 
This puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term. We are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our upcoming Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 30. It will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team, especially those who joined us over the past year. So it's a great chance to provide a full strategic update, including our long-term financial targets, and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers, including discussions with a few of those customers who've deployed some of our most advanced technologies. Matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days.

So yes, the backlog growth in M&CS specifically was about 49% in this past quarter. So a really good uptick. Really encouraged by a number of not just the large deal wins that the team has achieved there, but also the base business. The day-to-day business grew quite nicely in the quarter, and we see good momentum there. We feel that the site access issues have certainly eased. I wouldn't say they're completely resolved, but they're certainly trending in the right direction. 
Where we're really seeing -- and really, the primary challenge out there right now, which the team is all over working hard to mitigate that is some of the component shortages. And that's not limited to us. That really is not just across our sector, but as you all well know, broader sectors as well. But the team is all over. We're doing everything we can, whether it be kind of paying up for some components, making sure we lock in commitments around that. So we're very -- we feel very good about the momentum. 
It really does feel like that part of our business is turning the corner in terms of converting things into backlog. We look at the margin in backlog, especially as we go into 2022 and feel very good about that, not just what they've achieved already this year. Again, challenges aside in the second half around component shortages, and those are real. They're not insignificant, but we're confident we can work through that.

Just as a reminder, we're now up on our third price increase for the year. We got out of the gate early with a price increase in the first quarter because of the continuous rise in the commodity prices. We've then taken that decision to take 2 additional price increases. I think there is one unique dynamic that we're working through. The backlogs are a little higher than we typically find at any given period of time. And so the realizations, there's a little bit of a timing issue. But net-net, I think we're doing a good job here, and it will continue to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter."

But your question around using stock as a currency, that is something that we are very much open to in a disciplined way. And I like the point you made. 
I do believe that -- and again, I'm very proud of what the entire team has done here on making sure that sustainability for us and the broader ESG is not just some kind of stand-alone thing.

When you shift over and look at AWS and M&CS where I think we're up 43% in AWS in the quarter and 70% in M&CS, there is true demand returning. But we are seeing customers try to get in line a little bit, whether it's ahead of longer lead times that we published, some incremental pricing actions that we've announced, or importantly, the supply chain components that we've talked about extensively on the call. All of that in combination is certainly impacting some of the buying behaviors.

As we look into the second half, we don't have that same tailwind. Last year, we had restructuring.

And then I look at it and we look at it from a technology and kind of application standpoint. 
I'd say on the utility side, we will continue. Certainly, second half of this year and onward, we will continue to look at and do bolt-ons and tuck-ins from a technology standpoint to round out that utility offering and feel very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline there. We've talked a lot in the past about industrial. And certainly, that continues to be something we're very interested in and we've got an active pipeline there. As I always say, it takes 2 to tango. And so we can't control the timing of when these things happen, but we continue to cultivate those opportunities. 
And then there are other verticals, I mean, in commercial and resi and ag that we certainly keep on our radar screen to look at. So we feel good about the pipeline. And you'll see some things there that we'll continue to do on the bolt-on front, and we'll continue to cultivate some of the larger opportunities here over time. We're going to continue to remain disciplined on valuation. And as I mentioned earlier to one of the earlier questions, we certainly are open to using our stock as a currency, where it makes sense. So that will not be a disabler. It's an enabler when and if that makes sense to do."

I would say that one of the things, and you probably heard this elsewhere, Joe, at least from a deal flow standpoint, I think we've all kind of learned how to negotiate these projects and do these deals without being in front of each other all the time.

On the inventory front, actually, we'd actually like to carry a little bit more inventory right now to manage through some of the supply chain challenges. And we had actually built into our plan building up a little more inventory. But the reality is, as soon as we are getting that in, it's going back out the door to meet demand, which is a good thing. 
And we have an active supply chain financing program that helps us take advantage of our strong credit rating, and we're seeing good adoption with some of our suppliers onboarding into that program, and that's giving us some benefits. So it's really across the board, and we're going to continue to drive it through the rest of the year."

Obviously, it's a short-cycle business. So as we've gone out with successive price increases, there has been some pull in and buy in there, no doubt. But we do feel good about the momentum. I would say also, one of the things that we're very pleased about there is the team has made an increasing number of investments in new product development in that business to refresh some product lines. And so we're seeing the impact and success of that, and we're going to continue to make those investments. 
Really focused on things like energy efficiency as one example. But again, I think that it's a similar rebound right now that we're seeing from previous downturns on a global scale.

We've also seen healthy activity in Europe, where we had double-digit growth in the first quarter. that's come from some modest share gains as well as, we believe, the resilience of our supply chain versus some of our peers.

By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. 
Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem, so we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. 
Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above-market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. 
This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year.

Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. 
Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits while the U.S. declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad-based across all segments and regions. In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19-impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. 
Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. 
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad-based across all regions. 
Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single-digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The U.S. was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. 
And now please turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. 
By geography, Western Europe was up 1%, while Emerging Markets was flat. The U.S. was down mid-single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. 
And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
And now please turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."

I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments, with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carry reliability is at an all-time low. 
We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the U.S. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short-term mitigations and longer-term actions. In the short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly 2 months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and thus improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. 
To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life, and we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. 
One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross-border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well-established localization strategies there. So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A."

Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be at risk and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. 
Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach User Conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry-wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. 
On longer-term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and to Science-based Targets. Over the next 2 weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. 
Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP to the utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net zero commitments with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just 1 reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. 
Turning back to the near-term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year."
118218449,1685196359,2421318,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick.

The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid- to high single digits to flat. 
On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the U.S.,  but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentary, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. 
And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial dewatering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid-single-digit outlook in the commercial end market. 
The U.S. business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp, and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. 
And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows: for Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid-single-digit growth. We expect high single-digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid-single digits rather than up mid-single digits. 
We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50 which, at the midpoint, reflects a 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. 
We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. 
Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter. This includes flattish growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS down high teens. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 
Ten years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. 
The immediate challenge around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose-driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions. And we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization, all of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day. 
So I'm confident that our current market momentum will carry us strongly into 2022 and beyond and keep us on pace to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial milestones. Now let's turn the call over to you, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Operator, please lead us into Q&A."

So I do want to shout-out Emerging Markets doing really well in this business. We're seeing good strength in mining and some of the other industrial markets. And that's been a part of -- a key part of our growth."

Just in general, there's been a lot of discussion here on the call around the chip shortages you're seeing. In terms of inflation, it does sound like it's less of an impact in that segment versus the others. Can you kind of give us a sense of what you're seeing there?

Would you say that's the same sort of time frame for M&CS or is that more into 2022 as you see price read out?"

And so we feel like in the first part of 2022, we'll continue to see that trend as  well. 
So our teams have worked really hard to be thoughtful and responsible as it comes down to price. This year, we've taken multiple price actions. When we look sort of at our expectations around where we thought inflation would be, we thought it would be around -- across the company around 3% at the beginning of the year, and it's going to turn out to be closer to 5% on an annual basis. And so that's been the reason we've gone out with these price increases to keep that in balance."

By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance, with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. 
Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem. So we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. 
Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. 
Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above-market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. 
Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year. 
Sandy, over to you."

Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. 
Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits, while the U.S. declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad-based across all segments and regions. 
In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19-impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. 
Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range, with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. 
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad-based across all regions. 
Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single-digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The U.S. was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. 
Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. 
And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically, as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. 
Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. 
By geography, Western Europe was up 1%, while Emerging Markets was flat. The U.S. was down mid-single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. 
And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
And now please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."

I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments, with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carry reliability is at an all-time low. 
We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the U.S. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short-term mitigations and longer-term actions. In the short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly 2 months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and, thus, improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. 
To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life. And we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. 
One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross-border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that, in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well-established localization strategies there. 
So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail, but perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A."

Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be brisk, and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. 
Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach user conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry-wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. 
On a longer-term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to Science-Based Targets. 
Over the next 2 weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP to the utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net-zero commitments, with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. 
More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so, and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just one reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. Turning back to the near-term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year."

The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid- to high single digits to flat. 
On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the U.S.,  but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentaries, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. 
And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based, with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial dewatering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid-single-digit outlook in the commercial end market. 
The U.S. business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. 
And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows: for Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid-single-digit growth; we expect high single-digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid-single digits rather than up mid-single digits. 
We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50, which, at the midpoint, reflects a 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. 
We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro-to-dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. 
Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter.

The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 
Ten years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. 
The immediate challenge around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying, and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose-driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions. And we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization, all of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day. 
So I'm confident that our current market momentum will carry us strongly into 2022 and beyond and keep us on pace to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial milestones. Now let's turn the call over to you, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. 
Operator, please lead us into Q&A."

I've said before, I think that there is, historically, not really ever been of reliance at the utility level on federal government subsidization or funding.

It's hard to put a specific number on it. 
But the order growth, I think, certainly in Water Infrastructure and, most notably, Applied Water, some of that, certainly, which is largely book-and-ship business, has been people trying to get ahead of the supply chain delays. Not that we aren't seeing any of that within M&CS, but the large majority of that business, again, is driven really by some of these large deals and those orders converting.

By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance, with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. 
Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem. So we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. 
Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. 
Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above-market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. 
Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year. 
Sandy, over to you."

Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. 
Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits, while the U.S. declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad-based across all segments and regions. 
In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19-impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. 
Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range, with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. 
Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad-based across all regions. 
Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single-digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The U.S. was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. 
Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. 
And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically, as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. 
Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. 
By geography, Western Europe was up 1%, while Emerging Markets was flat. The U.S. was down mid-single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. 
And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3x at the end of the quarter. 
And now please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick."

I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments, with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carrier reliability is at an all-time low. 
We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the U.S. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short-term mitigations and longer-term actions. In the short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly 2 months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and, thus, improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. 
To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life. And we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. 
One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross-border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that, in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well-established localization strategies there. 
So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail, but perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A."

Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be brisk, and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. 
Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach user conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry-wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. 
On a longer-term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to Science-Based Targets. 
Over the next 2 weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP to the utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net-zero commitments, with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. 
More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so, and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just one reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. Turning back to the near-term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year."
118218449,1685196359,2454728,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick.

The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid- to high single digits to flat. 
On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the U.S.,  but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentaries, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. 
And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based, with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial dewatering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid-single-digit outlook in the commercial end market. 
The U.S. business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. 
And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows: for Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid-single-digit growth; we expect high single-digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid-single digits rather than up mid-single digits. 
We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50, which, at the midpoint, reflects a 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. 
We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro-to-dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. 
Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter. This includes flattish growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS down high teens. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments."

The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 
Ten years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. 
The immediate challenges around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying, and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose-driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions. And we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization, all of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day.
