The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely.",4374,"Thank you, Tom. The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. 
Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. 
Certain of the company's bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company's products remain generally available to consumers. 
In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in foodservice on-premise consumption. 
The company's sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company's largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020, third and fourth quarters. The company's sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages and its supply chain remains intact. 
Company is continually addressing the increase in its aluminum can requirements, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with [ $1.02 ] billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning 1 product in Japan. 
We will refer to this on our call as product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. 
Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared to $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily Q2 decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. 
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing. 
Operating income increased 26.9% to $402.3 million, up from $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 35.5% to $429.6 million from $317 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the companies foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets. 
Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 28.9% to $328.6 million from $255 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5% to $0.88 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 30.6% to $0.62 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. 
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen for the month of December 2020 compared to December 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 34% to 45.5%; in Brazil from 25.2% to 32.2%; and in Chile from 40.3% to 47.2%. 
Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.8% to 15.4% in Belgium; from 28.3% to 31.1% in France; from 22% to 27.3% in Great Britain; and from 6.1% to 7.9% in the Netherlands.

Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain markets statistics cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
We are seeing some recent softness in the performance in the Energy category in the U.S., which we are reviewing. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $384.8 million, 32.2% of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $319.5 million or 31.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019.

Gross profit percentage for the region was negatively impacted by the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs, foreign exchange rates as well as geographic mix. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourht quarter compared with 38.7% in the same quarter of 2019.

We're also pleased that the fourth -- in the fourth quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2.1% in dollars and 5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% in dollars and [ 2.5% ] in local currency over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% versus 40.2% over the same period in 2019.

Since our last earnings call in November 2020, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the maker of Bang Energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
In early October 2020, in the United States, we launched Ultra Water Melon and Juice Monster Papillon to the trade. We also refreshed our Juice Monster Chaos SKU into the new Juice Monster Chaotic. Initial results are positive. In late January 2021 in the United States, we launched rain, Cherry Limeade and Rain White Gummy Bear as well as Rain in Ferno, Watermelon Warlord to the trade.

February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, and we launched Mean Green -- and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. 
We were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the 2020 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets have recently reintroduced lockdowns which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. 
[indiscernible] Monster Mango Loco was launched in Botswana in November 2020 and in Israel in January 2021 and is now available in 40 markets across EMEA. 
Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Italy in February 2021 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra was launched in Serbia and Ukraine in October 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets.

The Monster Ultra black was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020, it is now available in 2 EMEA markets. 
[ Monster, The Doctor ] was launched in Kenya in December 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. [ Monster Mule ] was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020 and in Great Britain and Iceland in January 2021 and in Austria, Belgium and Norway in February 2021.

Burn 0 [ Rasberry ] was launched in Hungary in October 2020. Ultra 0 Raspberry was launched in Serbia in November 2020. Predator Purple Rain was launched in Namibia in December 2020 and is now available in 3 EMEA markets. 
Rain Sour Apple variant was launched in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland in October 2020. In November 2020, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Rosa in Australia and New Zealand, in addition to [ Bu ] Energy Island Punch in Papua New Guinea. China, we piloted our new noncarbonated [ Monster Energy Dragons! Gold ] in a number of provinces during the fourth quarter of 2020. Initial consumer feedback has been positive and we will commence with the national rollout of [ Monster Energy Dragons! Gold ] during 2021. 
During the 2020 fourth quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon team along with Monster Energy Green and Monster Energy Ultra. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra and Monster Mango Loco in Singapore, Monster Mango Loco in Vietnam and Monster Energy Ultra in the Philippines. 
We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets in 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. 
As of February 25, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate January 2021 sales to be approximately 18.2% higher than in January 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, January 2021 sales would have been approximately 17.2% higher than comparable January 2020 sales. 
January 2021 has had 2 fewer selling days in January 2020. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and UNI at redetermined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facility, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Two, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. 
[indiscernible] we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year.

I mean in previous calls like this, I've spoken about the fact that we engage in contracts with aluminum can suppliers from time to time to fix some of our aluminum costs. And we've done a little bit of that for 2021. 
Obviously, we monitor aluminum costs every morning. And we've seen, as you've seen and the rest of the group have seen an increasing situation with regard to aluminum and also with the Midwest premium, which I think has taken a lot of us by surprise. The aluminum, the Midwest premium was in the upper single digits some months ago and with the imposition of the tariffs on aluminum went up and everyone expected that to fall, and it hasn't. 
It's just sitting at just below $0.16. So where we are, we're doing our best to manage our aluminum costs and I'm not sure there's much more I can say other than, yes, we will -- aluminum costs will increase over -- in 2021 over 2020. So that is -- that's a fact of life, and it will impact us as it will impact many other beverage companies."

[Audio Gap] But there are a whole bunch of products that we manufacture that cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. We do a wide range of products from hot fold [indiscernible] and those products cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. So where we can, we try and work with the system. And obviously, that's our major focus. And that's been improving over the years. We've opened up a number of Coca-Cola facilities to produce Monster. On the other hand, on procurement, which is a question you asked, that's been a longer-term project, and we haven't resolve that situation yet. 
The Coke bottlers have their own organization, which is for the Coca-Cola bottling situation. We are not a bottler, and we don't fall within that mandate. So that's been a difficult discussion, and it's something that I'm hoping that we'll be able to progress in the future.

On the second one, it var from country to country, Mark. But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. And so we are continuing to expand the number of SKUS, but it does vary. 
And in some countries, we're trying to start accelerating that instead of doing just 1 a year. We're actually increasing the pace of innovation going on shelves, but it does vary quite dramatically from country to country. 
And where we can get receptiveness from retailers to increase the energy space, we obviously take advantage of that and increase more. And so we did, as you would have noticed from the call, we went into quite a lot of depth in EMEA in places like of new products and where we're introducing new flavors because that pace is accelerating, but there is quite a long runway internationally for international markets to get up to the U.S. levels. 
And there are many products that haven't yet been launched at all in the international market. So the rehab products are in very few markets internationally. Just starting to launch some of the Hydro products. 
So there are a number of product lines or we call them as subfamilies that aren't yet -- don't appear in many international markets at all. So there is opportunity there. But it all depends on the appetite of retailers and their willingness to grant additional space. 
But I think that as we've seen everywhere, the category does increase sales -- on a sales per unit basis, it is a hiring than other -- a lot of other comparable beverages, competitive beverages. 
And so we are seeing a receptiveness from retailers to continually recognizing the category and increasing the allocation of space."

The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely.",4335,"Thank you, Tom. The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants.
Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating.
Certain of the company's bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company's products remain generally available to consumers.
In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption.  
The company's sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company's largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third and fourth quarters. The company's sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages and its supply chain remains intact.
Company is continually addressing the increase in its aluminum can requirements, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan.  
We will refer to this on our call as product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which was partially offset by favorable product mix.  
Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared with $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily due to decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing.
Operating income increased 26.9% to $402.3 million, up from $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 35.5% to $429.6 million from $317 million in the 2019 fourth quarter.
Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets.
Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 28.9% to $328.6 million from $255 million in the 2019 fourth quarter.  
Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5% to $0.88 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. 
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen for the month of December 2020 compared to December 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 34% to 45.5%; in Brazil from 25.2% to 32.2%; and in Chile from 40.3% to 47.2%. 
Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.8% to 15.4% in Belgium; from 28.3% to 31.1% in France; from 22% to 27.3% in Great Britain; and from 6.1% to 7.9% in the Netherlands.

Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of December 2020 decreased from 55.5% to 49.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the impact of the product returns in Japan as well as initial trial sales following the launch of new products by 2 large competitors. 
Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain markets statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
We are seeing some recent softness in the performance Energy category in the U.S., which we are reviewing. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $384.8 million, 32.2% of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $319.5 million or 31.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the product returns. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.1 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. 
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Net sales adjusted for the product returns in this region increased 30.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currencies. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 30.2% compared to 38.7% in the same quarter in 2019. 
Gross profit percentage for the region was negatively impacted by the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs, foreign exchange rates as well as geographic mix.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourth quarter compared with 38.7% in the same quarter of 2019. 
In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 31.7%. We're also pleased that the fourth -- in the fourth quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2.1% in dollars and 5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019.
In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% in dollars and 2.5% in local currency over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% versus 40.2% over the same period in 2019.
Excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and related costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.3% versus 40.2% in the comparable period in 2019.
Japan net sales in the quarter decreased 16.4% in dollars and 18.4% in local currency without the impact of the product returns in Japan, net sales decreased 6.7%.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 38.6% compared to 42.6% over the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 74.9% in dollars and 133.6% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 72.9% in dollars and 80.3% in local currency in the quarter. Since our last earnings call in November 2020, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the maker of Bang Energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
In early October 2020, in the United States, we launched Ultra Watermelon and Juice Monster Papillon to the trade. We also refreshed our Juice Monster Khaos SKU into the new Juice Monster Khaotic. Initial results are positive. In late January 2021 in the United States, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno, Watermelon Warlord to the trade. 
We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4 pack. In late February 2021, we launched our core 4 flavors, Monster Green, Lo-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise, in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service. 
In Canada, in January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta and Java Monster with Oat Milk. February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, and we launched Mean Green -- and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. 
We were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the 2020 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets have recently reintroduced lockdowns which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. 
Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Botswana in November 2020 and in Israel in January 2021 and is now available in 40 markets across EMEA. 
Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Italy in February 2021 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra was launched in Serbia and Ukraine in October 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. 
Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is now available in 22 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Fiesta was launched in Great Britain and Sweden in January 2021 and in Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland and Spain in February 2021. The Monster Ultra Black was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020, it is now available in 2 EMEA markets. 
Monster, The Doctor was launched in Kenya in December 2020. It is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Mule was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020 and in Great Britain and Iceland in January 2021 and in Austria, Belgium and Norway in February 2021. Monster Mule is now available in 10 EMEA markets.
Burn Zero Rasberry was launched in Hungary in October 2020. Ultra Zero Raspberry was launched in Serbia in November 2020. Predator Purple Rain was launched in Namibia in December 2020, and it is now available in 3 EMEA markets. 
Rain Sour Apple variant was launched in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland in October 2020. In November 2020, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Rosa in Australia and New Zealand, in addition to BU Energy Island Punch in Papua New Guinea. China, we piloted our new noncarbonated Monster Energy Dragon's Gold in a number of provinces during the fourth quarter of 2020. Initial consumer feedback has been positive, and we will commence with the national rollout of Monster Energy Dragon's Gold during 2021. 
During the 2020 fourth quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon Tea along with Monster Energy Green and Monster Energy Ultra. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra and Monster Mango Loco in Singapore, Monster Mango Loco in Vietnam and Monster Energy Ultra in the Philippines. 
We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets in 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program.
As of February 25, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate January 2021 sales to be approximately 18.2% higher than in January 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, January 2021 sales would have been approximately 17.2% higher than comparable January 2020 sales.
January 2021 has had 2 fewer selling days in January 2020. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Two, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. 
Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year."

I mean in previous calls like this, I've spoken about the fact that we engage in contracts with aluminum can suppliers from time to time to fix some of our aluminum costs. And we've done a little bit of that for 2021. 
Obviously, we monitor aluminum costs every morning. And we've seen, as you've seen and the rest of the group have seen an increasing situation with regard to aluminum and also with the Midwest Premium, which I think has taken a lot of us by surprise. The aluminum, the Midwest Premium was in the upper single digits some months ago and with the imposition of the tariffs on aluminum went up and we -- everyone expected that to fall, and it hasn't.
It's just sitting at just below $0.16. So where we are, we're doing our best to manage our aluminum costs and I'm not sure there's much more I can say other than, yes, we will -- aluminum costs will increase over -- in 2021 over 2020. So that is -- that's a fact of life, and it will impact us as it will impact many other beverage companies. 
And regarding your second question about take your price increase. We're not -- at this time, we haven't been looking at taking a price increase. However, one never rules out, take your price increase when the right opportunity presents itself, and right now, none of our competitors have been looking at price increases. I know we led the market last time. But this time, we're cautious, as indeed, we should be with our market share. And we're examining the opportunities to take price up, and we will, if we find there's an opportunity to do so."

I guess on the follow-up what prevents you from working more with the Coke system in procuring aluminum and manufacturing in general so that you have a bit more of sharing of ability to supply bottlers? And second separate question is just could you update us, Rodney, probably on where you are from an SKU standpoint in terms of international markets sort of broadly versus where you are in the U.S., meaning how many do you have on a typical shelf outside the U.S.? And what's the opportunity going forward for that?"

In terms of working with the Coca-Cola bottlers and working with the Coca-Cola system on procurement of cans, we're doing what we can to produce within the Coca-Cola network. Obviously, that's something that we like to do because it reduces shipping costs and improves efficiencies. 
But there are a whole bunch of products that we manufacture that cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. We do a wide range of products from hot fold to retort and those products cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. So where we can, we try and work with the system. And obviously, that's our major focus. And that's been improving over the years. We've opened up a number of Coca-Cola facilities to produce Monster. On the other hand, on procurement, which is a question you asked, that's been a longer-term project, and we haven't resolved that situation yet.
The Coke bottlers have their own organization, which is for the Coca-Cola bottling situation. We are not a bottler, and we don't fall within that mandate. So that's been a difficult discussion, and it's something that I'm hoping that we'll be able to progress in the future.
But right now, we're doing our own procurement of all our raw materials, including aluminum and including cans. So Rodney, you asked that you answer the second question, so go ahead."

But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. A",319,"Yes. On the second one, it varies from country to country, Mark. But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. And so we are continuing to expand the number of SKUs, but it does vary.
And in some countries, we're trying to start accelerating that instead of doing just one a year. We're actually increasing the pace of innovation going on shelves, but it does vary quite dramatically from country to country. 
And where we can get receptiveness from retailers to increase the energy space, we obviously take advantage of that and increase more. And so we did, as you would have noticed from the call, we went into quite a lot of depth in EMEA in places like of new products and where we're introducing new flavors because that pace is accelerating, but there is quite a long runway internationally for international markets to get up to the U.S. levels.
And there are many products that haven't yet been launched at all in the international market. So the rehab products are in very few markets internationally. We're just starting to launch some of the Hydro products. 
So there are a number of product lines or we call them as subfamilies that aren't yet in -- don't appear in many international markets at all. So there is opportunity there. But it all depends on the appetite of retailers and their willingness to grant additional space.
But I think that as we've seen everywhere, the category does increase sales -- on a sales per unit basis, it is a hiring in other -- a lot of other comparable beverages, competitive beverages. 
And so we are seeing a receptiveness from retailers to continually recognizing the category and increasing the allocation of space."

But as the energy category grows, there is a huge opportunity to be able to do that. And then in some countries like in China, we've actually launched unique items that are not available in the U.S. In Brazil, we have a tea product, for example, that's also not available in the U.S. So there are a bunch of products under the Monster brand that are not available in the U.S. that are distributed internationally and of course, our strategic brands are in various countries in the world, many of those -- many of the flavors that we sell in other parts of the world are not available in the U.S. So it really is a mixed bag.

The company's top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company's bottlers or distributors have in part be negatively affected for varying periods of time.
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum care industry. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia. However, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. Furthermore, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment.
In the first quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.24 billion compared to $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 first quarter would have been up 16.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5%, and compared with 60% in this 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily the result of increased input costs mainly increased raw material freight in costs, geographical sales mix and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales.
Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2% compared with 25.6% in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income increased 13.5% to $414.1 million up from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased 13% to $315.2 million as compared to $278.8 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2% to $0.59 from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2021 compared to March 2020, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 37.9% to 45.2% and in Brazil from 25.4% to 34.7%. In Chile, Monster's retail market share decreased from 42.1% to 40%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in Vale in Argentina.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended April 4, 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.8% to 16% in Germany, from 19.7% to 28.1% in Italy and from 17.3% to 20.6% in South Africa.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period till the end of March 2021. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.1% in Belgium; from 12.6% to 14.8% in the Czech Republic; from 24.5% to 26.4% in Denmark; from 28% to 31.8% in France; from 22.7% to 27.9% in Great Britain; from 34% to 37.7% in Greece; from 6.4% to 8% in the Netherlands; from 24.7% to 29.1% in Norway; from 15.3% to 18.2% in Poland; from 23.8% to 28% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 34% to 36% in Spain; and from 13.5% to 14.9% in Sweden. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021, and increased from 10% to 13.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.6% to 11.8% during the same period. The market share of the company's brands in Australia for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021, increased from 23.6% to 24.9%.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of March 2021 decreased from 62.1% to 50.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. However, our share was negatively impacted by the labeling issue of a product referenced in our fourth quarter 2020 release, which was relisted on retail shelves in April 2021 by the introduction of new SKUs by a new competitor and by the timing of our 2021 innovation. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.

Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.3 million in the 2021 first quarter.

Since our last earnings call in February 2021 and there have been no significant updates on our litigation with vital pharmaceuticals and the maker of Bang energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subdued okay. We will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, during early January 2021, we converted our 10-pack Monster portfolio into 12 packs. In late January 2021, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Rain and Ferno Watermill and Warlord. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4-pack. In late February 2021, we launched 4 core flavors: Monster Green, Low-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service channel.
In late March 2021, we converted our entire Monster Hydro portfolio into 20-ounce PET containers and added 2 new Monster Hydro Super Sport SKUs, Kilokiwi and Macho Mango. In late March 2021, we also launched Rehab Monster Strawberry Lemonade as the first non tea option in the Rehab Monster brand family. We refreshed 2 SKUs during the first quarter of 2021, Monster Max Super Dry into Monster Nitro Super dry in a 16-ounce can as well as a refreshed design on Monster Result.
This summer, we are also planning to launch a line -- a new line of energy drinks under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which will contain an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. Initially, True North will have a limited target in 2021, with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. We are planning to launch additional new products later in 2021. The in Canada, during early January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fester, Java Monster Oat Milk as well as Monster Ultra Paradise 4 pack.
Later in February 2021, we launched Monster Ultra paradise in singles as a 310 ml option. In early March 2021, we launched Reign Lillico Lice singles and Rain Orange Dreamsicle in singles and a 4-pack. We also launched NOS Turbo in March 2021. In February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury which is one of our affordable energy brands. In March 2021, we launched Ultra Watermellon in Puerto Rico and Ultra Paradise and Aruba.
We introduced a number of SKUs across EMA in the 2021 first quarter. Highlights include the geographical expansion of a number of existing Monster, Reign and strategic brand products into new countries, including Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Monarch, which is Papillon in non-EMEA markets, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Monster Ultra Paradise, Monster Ultra Fiesta, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Ultra Blue, Black Monster Ultra Sunrise in Russia, Monster Mule, Burn Zero Peach and Play Zero Peach. Various Reign SKUS, including Reign Melania, Sour Apple, Rosebery, pitchers, Orange Dreamsicle and Lemon Heads were launched in Belgium. The Netherlands, South Africa, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2021.
In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors.
During the 2021 first quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi soft drinks. Additionally, we began shipments in the quarter in Japan for the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise in April 2021. During the 2021 first quarter, we launched pipeline Punch in Hong Kong and Macau, and began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or market lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.
During the 2021 first quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate April 2021 sales to be approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2021 sales would have been approximately 67.8% higher than comparable April 2020 sales. April 2021 had the same number of selling days as April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative April 2020 sales will materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we reported that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales with the same number of selling days in both periods. In this regard, we are caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Five, finally, please note that similar to last year in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual stockholders' meeting exclusively as a viral meeting via live webcast. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the company's proxy statement.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So what happened when we set our can requirements with our can companies about a year ago, we estimated that our sales would be 10% to 12% or up this year. In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that. So whatever we contracted for, we've got. What happened with our sales in January and February, ourselves were doing okay. And then in March, they've spiked up. And as Rodney quoted, in April, they are spiked up yet again. So what we've done is we've procured additional cans from South America and from Asia that will start coming in late in the second quarter. We also have new can companies that are opening their doors later this year, and we will be drawing cans from those companies as well. So to answer your question about the first quarter, yes, there was an impact. And the big impact, as we mentioned, in the release and on this call is that the bigger impact was these freight in costs where we were drawing product, for example, from Canada, and we were shipping product from various locations to our distribution center that impacted cost of sales. We also had -- we broke our orbits. In other words, we've always tried to manufacture and sell within regions to avoid excessive shipping costs. We had to break that this year to satisfy consumer demand and so that was another factor that impinged on the results. But the margin was impacted by -- not only by those freight costs, but as we mentioned by the promotional allowances that were higher in the second quarter across the board. And also from our geographical sales mix because, as you know, we sold a significantly higher percentage of product overseas than we did in the U.S. So it's the same story that we've experienced and we've spoken to shareholders, the more we sell overseas, the lower is our gross margin percentage. But again, I must caution shareholders that we bank dollars, we don't bank gross profit percentages. And in taking the decisions we took in the first quarter, it was important to do so to satisfy demand. We knew the profitability would be higher, but the percentage may, in fact, be lower, which it was."

In the first quarter, the impact of the aluminum can costs were not a major factor. And as you know, and everyone else on the call probably knows as well that we have suffered significant and will set a significant increases in aluminum costs going forward. So for example, it's no secret. But if you look back on a year ago, aluminum costs are up 83.6%, including the Midwest premium in the U.S., and they're up 71%, 71.1% in Europe. So as we go forward, we may not have some of the cost impacts on gross margin, but we certainly will have impacts on aluminum in the second and subsequent quarters. So for me to talk more about the first quarter, we don't actually give the numbers out that you're asking for. But what I can say is that I don't expect the margins to improve going forward this year. I expect that we will not -- that our margins will not improve as we go into the second, third. Possibly the fourth quarter, I think things will be better. That's my analysis. But certainly in the second and third quarter, we will continue to suffer gross margin percentage in our stress gross margin percentage erosion."

Remember, they're importing a substantial amount of their cans and product from overseas. So we'll be watching that. But there are other ways to take price up, for example, we can reassess, which we are doing, structure of promotional allowances to move margins in a more positive direction. But again, we don't want to disturb the business that is doing very well. Our share is -- we're happy with where the business is going. We're happy with our share, and we know when to disturb what we already have. So we bring in cans from abroad, as I said, we're getting new cans in the system later on in the year.

We've decided a strategy, and we've developed products. And align, and we are going to launch that line. As regards to alcoholic sensing, we are still looking at the market. I think if you have been watching the market, I'm sure the analysts have been. I think you've seen quite a lot of -- a fortune of new products being launched. Many -- in cases from the same companies, just different variants. Throwing them against the wall and seeing what's going to stick. What you've also seen in the last 3 months, what we've noticed is quite a falloff in the rate of increase in the category. And as the category is maturing, so the increase is also tempering. So we are involved in looking at that category in developing products and as I think I've said in the last call, we simply don't want to launch a product. That's me-too and that follows everyone else. It's just no point in that and taking the time and effort and detracting from our focus on our core energy brands and portfolio, where we get a better return and have, obviously, it's much easier for us to get meaningful sales. But we are continuing to monitor the alcoholic energy seltzer category. And we may well do something in that.

Just -- it does sound like there's a little bit of demand impact from the lack of full supply on the aluminum side. Are you expecting that to be a significant issue in Q2 before it gets better and you get some of this incremental supply in? Just trying to understand that in the short term. And then just a broader question, we've obviously seen an acceleration in U.S. energy category growth the last few quarters after the initial weakness for a few months post-COVID. Can you just review what you think the key factors have been behind that acceleration in U.S. category growth? How sustainable they are going forward as we sort of look to that cycling that higher category growth in the back half of the year?"

So Dara, if you look at April sales, for example, and you take out -- you strip out what happened in 2020. And you can see that there was a very big impact in sales in the second quarter and a very positive impact. So it is presenting challenges to the supply chain team, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we're able to keep as much as possible in stock. In fact, we're focusing on the SKUs that are generating the significant part of our volumes at the expense of SKUs that are not performing as well. So that's really where we're at with regard to the second quarter. We will be getting cans in. If these port issues resolve themselves, and we'll -- we're trying as best as we can to get back in stock as soon as possible."

The uncertainty that we've got is, obviously, for cans that we're reporting, we are also incurring freight costs above the aluminum cost or can price. So that's why those costs will go up the shorter term. As the additional plants in the U.S. come on stream, we will get back to a more normalized pricing structure for cans and get the additional volume. So it's a little difficult now to predict exactly where we're going to go on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis, but we think it will normalize, as Hilton said, towards the fourth quarter.
With regard to the increased category. I think we're already in a world of just unknowns. The category had a really steep hit [indiscernible] in late March, early April last year. Different in different parts of the world, when a lot of the bottlers literally took their staff and people teams out of the markets. But it has come back and the growth has come back really, really nicely. And so one of the things that we were -- which were sort of unusual, we found that the growth was generally, historically has always been led by the convenience channel at a higher rate than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And that sort of reversed itself with COVID. So again, you're looking at factors that are just not normal. What we have seen, as you can see from the last 4 weeks numbers, we quoted in Nielsen from convenience, that started to pick up again quite nicely. So again, we're in a very uncertain period because of what happened last year and your comps on last year. But even if you look at the 2-year stack sort of set of numbers, you're getting some healthy growth back, where the category had slowed a little bit towards the end of '19, the growth was -- they were still growing a bit slower. So we think that we will see continued growth regardless of how we come out of COVID and how our people come back into the markets. And we are hopeful for that. But again, it's -- we just can't predict that at this stage. Our numbers are good. The numbers are strong. And Red Bull's numbers have been strong again, a little bit, we think, skewed by the switch from on-premise to off-premise, but continue to grow. And obviously, we are the main players in the category. And so the category growth is driven by our -- respectively, by our 2 brands respective sales. So I think it all goes well for us, but we just don't have any -- I can't give you any further color on it because we would be guessing, I think we all are."

The company's top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company's bottlers or distributors have in part be negatively affected for varying periods of time.
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum care industry. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia. 
However, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. Furthermore, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment.
In the first quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.24 billion compared to $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 first quarter would have been up 16.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5%, and compared with 60% in this 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily the result of increased input costs mainly increased raw material freight in costs, geographical sales mix and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales.
Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2% compared with 25.6% in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income increased 13.5% to $414.1 million up from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased 13% to $315.2 million as compared to $278.8 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2% to $0.59 from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2021 compared to March 2020, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 37.9% to 45.2% and in Brazil from 25.4% to 34.7%. In Chile, Monster's retail market share decreased from 42.1% to 40%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

Monster remains the market leader in Japan. However, our share was negatively impacted by the labeling issue of a product referenced in our fourth quarter 2020 release, which was relisted on retail shelves in April 2021 by the introduction of new SKUs by a new competitor and by the timing of our 2021 innovation. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.

Since our last earnings call in February 2021, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice. We will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
In the United States, during early January 2021, we converted our 10-pack Monster portfolio into 12 packs. In late January 2021, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno Watermelon Warlord. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4-pack. In late February 2021, we launched 4 core flavors: Monster Green, Low-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service channel.
In late March 2021, we converted our entire Monster Hydro portfolio into 20-ounce PET containers and added 2 new Monster Hydro Super Sport SKUs, Killer Kiwi and Macho Mango. In late March 2021, we also launched Rehab Monster Strawberry Lemonade as the first non-tea option in the Rehab Monster brand family. We refreshed 2 SKUs during the first quarter of 2021, Monster Max Super Dry into Monster Nitro Super Dry in a 16-ounce can as well as a refreshed design on Monster Assault.
This summer, we are also planning to launch a line -- a new line of energy drinks under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which will contain an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. Initially, True North will have a limited target in 2021, with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. We are planning to launch additional new products later in 2021. 
In Canada, during early January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta, Java Monster Oat Milk as well as Monster Ultra Paradise 4 pack. Later in February 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in singles as a 310 ml option. In early March 2021, we launched Reign Lilikoi Lychee singles and Reign Orange Dreamsicle in singles and a 4-pack. We also launched NOS Turbo in March 2021. In February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico. And in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury which is one of our affordable energy brands. In March 2021, we launched Ultra Watermelon in Puerto Rico and Ultra Paradise and Aruba.
We introduced a number of SKUs across EMA in the 2021 first quarter. Highlights include the geographical expansion of a number of existing Monster, Reign and strategic brand products into new countries, including Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Monarch, which is Papillon in non-EMEA markets, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Monster Ultra Paradise, Monster Ultra Fiesta, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Ultra Blue, Black Monster Ultra Sunrise in Russia, Monster Mule, Burn Zero Peach and Play Zero Peach. Various Reign SKUs, including Reign Melon Mania, Sour Apple, Razzle Berry, Peach Fizz, Orange Dreamsicle and Lemon HDZ were launched in Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2021.
In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with One Chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors.
During the 2021 first quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we began shipments in the quarter in Japan for the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise in April 2021. During the 2021 first quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Hong Kong and Macau, and began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or market lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.
During the 2021 first quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate April 2021 sales to be approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2021 sales would have been approximately 67.8% higher than comparable April 2020 sales. April 2021 had the same number of selling days as April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative April 2020 sales will materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we reported that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales with the same number of selling days in both periods. In this regard, we are cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, it's co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. 
Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Five, finally, please note that similar to last year in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual stockholders' meeting exclusively as a viral meeting via live webcast. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the company's proxy statement.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that.",386,"Okay. So maybe I can get that, Bonnie. So what happened when we set our can requirements with our can companies about a year ago, we estimated that our sales would be 10% to 12% or up this year. In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that. So whatever we contracted for, we've got. What happened with our sales in January and February, our sales were doing okay. And then in March, they've spiked up. And as Rodney quoted, in April, they are spiked up yet again. 
So what we've done is we've procured additional cans from South America and from Asia that will start coming in late in the second quarter. We also have new can companies that are opening their doors later this year, and we will be drawing cans from those companies as well. So to answer your question about the first quarter, yes, there was an impact. And the big impact, as we mentioned, in the release and on this call is that the bigger impact was these freight-in costs where we were drawing product, for example, from Canada, and we were shipping product from various locations to our distribution center that impacted cost of sales. We also had -- we broke our orbits. 
In other words, we've always tried to manufacture and sell within regions to avoid excessive shipping costs. We had to break that this year to satisfy consumer demand and so that was another factor that impinged on the results. But the margin was impacted by -- not only by those freight costs, but as we mentioned by the promotional allowances that were higher in the second quarter across the board. And also from our geographical sales mix because, as you know, we sold a significantly higher percentage of product overseas than we did in the U.S. 
So it's the same story that we've experienced and we've spoken to shareholders, the more we sell overseas, the lower is our gross margin percentage. But again, I must caution shareholders that we bank dollars, we don't bank gross profit percentages. And in taking the decisions we took in the first quarter, it was important to do so to satisfy demand. We knew the profitability would be higher, but the percentage may, in fact, be lower, which it was."

In the first quarter, the impact of the aluminum can costs were not a major factor. And as you know, and everyone else on the call probably knows as well that we have suffered significant and will suffer significant increases in aluminum costs going forward. So for example, it's no secret. But if you look back on a year ago, aluminum costs are up 83.6%, including the Midwest Premium in the U.S., and they're up 71%, 71.1% in Europe. So as we go forward, we may not have some of the cost impacts on gross margin, but we certainly will have impacts on aluminum in the second and subsequent quarters. 
So for me to talk more about the first quarter, we don't actually give the numbers out that you're asking for. But what I can say is that I don't expect the margins to improve going forward this year. I expect that we will not -- that our margins will not improve as we go into the second, third. Possibly the fourth quarter, I think things will be better. That's my analysis. But certainly in the second and third quarter, we will continue to suffer gross margin percentage in our stress gross margin percentage erosion."

Remember, they're importing a substantial amount of their cans and product from overseas. So we'll be watching that. 
But there are other ways to take price up, for example, we can reassess, which we are doing, structure of promotional allowances to move margins in a more positive direction. But again, we don't want to disturb the business that is doing very well. Our share is -- we're happy with where the business is going. We're happy with our share, and we don't want to disturb what we already have. So we bring in cans from abroad, as I said, we're getting new cans in the system later on in the year.

I think if you have been watching the market, I'm sure the analysts have been. I think you've seen quite a lot of -- a fortune of new products being launched. Many -- in cases from the same companies, just different variants. Throwing them against the wall and seeing what's going to stick. 
What you've also seen in the last 3 months, what we've noticed is quite a falloff in the rate of increase in the category. And as the category is maturing, so the increase is also tempering. So we are involved in looking at that category in developing products and as I think I've said in the last call, we simply don't want to launch a product. That's me-too and that follows everyone else. It's just no point in that in taking the time and effort and detracting from our focus on our core energy brands and portfolio, where we get a better return and obviously, it's much easier for us to get meaningful sales. 
But we are continuing to monitor the alcoholic energy seltzer category. And we may well do something in that. But how we do it and what we do it is still not being determined and still not -- we don't have a firm direction.

There's no question about that. I think we underestimated the impact of their on-premise business moving into major channels. However, our share is doing nicely. Our sales are growing very nicely. And frankly, we are selling everything that we can make. 
And what you guys are not seeing or not addressing is things like Amazon. We spoke about the Stackline data and our other unmeasured channels, for example, the Home Depots and the Lowe's and the home improvement stores and all those other parts of the business that are very strong for us are continuing to grow and continue to gain share in those particular channels.

And then just a broader question, we've obviously seen an acceleration in U.S. energy category growth the last few quarters after the initial weakness for a few months post-COVID. Can you just review what you think the key factors have been behind that acceleration in U.S. category growth? How sustainable they are going forward as we sort of look to that cycling that higher category growth in the back half of the year?"

So that's really where we're at with regard to the second quarter. We will be getting cans in. If these port issues resolve themselves, and we'll -- we're trying as best as we can to get back in stock as soon as possible."

The uncertainty that we've got is, obviously, for cans that we're reporting, we are also incurring freight costs above the aluminum cost or can price. So that's why those costs will go up the shorter term. As the additional plants in the U.S. come on stream, we will get back to a more normalized pricing structure for cans and get the additional volume. So it's a little difficult now to predict exactly where we're going to go on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis, but we think it will normalize, as Hilton said, towards the fourth quarter.
With regard to the increased category. I think we're already in a world of just unknowns. The category had a really steep hit awards in late March, early April last year. Different in different parts of the world, when a lot of the bottlers literally took their staff and people teams out of the markets. But it has come back and the growth has come back really, really nicely. 
And so one of the things that we were -- which were sort of unusual, we found that the growth was generally, historically has always been led by the convenience channel at a higher rate than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And that sort of reversed itself with COVID. So again, you're looking at factors that are just not normal. What we have seen, as you can see from the last 4 weeks numbers, we quoted in Nielsen from convenience, that started to pick up again quite nicely. So again, we're in a very uncertain period because of what happened last year and your comps on last year. But even if you look at the 2-year stack sort of set of numbers, you're getting some healthy growth back, where the category had slowed a little bit towards the end of '19, the growth was -- they were still growing a bit slower. 
So we think that we will see continued growth regardless of how we come out of COVID and how our people come back into the markets. And we are hopeful for that. But again, it's -- we just can't predict that at this stage. Our numbers are good. The numbers are strong. And Red Bull's numbers have been strong again, a little bit, we think, skewed by the switch from on-premise to off-premise, but continue to grow. And obviously, we are the main players in the category. And so the category growth is driven by our -- respectively, by our 2 brands respective sales. So I think it all goes well for us, but we just don't have any -- I can't give you any further color on it because we would be guessing, I think we all are."

The company's top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees.

The company's top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company's bottlers and distributors have in part been negatively affected for varying periods of time. 
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The company's supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months. 
The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with 2 new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year. Logistical issues, including shortages of shipping containers and port of entry congestion could delay ongoing international supply of aluminum cans. 
Separately, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies as well as significant increases in domestic and international freight costs and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment, all of which in addition to other factors, will continue to adversely impact gross margin percentages. 
In the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.46 billion compared with $1.09 billion in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 33.6%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 second quarter would have been up 30.1%. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 second quarter was 57.2% compared with 60.3% in the 2020 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021, was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and increased input costs, mainly increased raw material freight in costs and aluminum can costs. 
Operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were $310.9 million compared with $252.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were 21.3% compared with 23.1% in the 2020 second quarter. Operating income increased 29.1% to $526 million, up from $407.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. 
Net income increased to 29.7% and to $403.8 million compared to $311.4 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 second quarter increased to 28.6% and to $0.75 from $0.59 in the second quarter of 2020.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2021 compared to June 2020, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 40.1% to 46.9% and in Brazil from 29.6% to 35.4%. In Chile, Monster's retail market share decreased from 45.7% to 41.9%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.

In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased to 105.7% in dollars and increased 86.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 39.8% compared to 38.1% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a favorable country and product mix. 
We're also pleased that in the 2021 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased 5.2% in dollars and decreased 0.1 pf a percent in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China.

In Japan, net sales in the 2021 second quarter decreased 15.1% in dollars and 13.9% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments.

In China, net sales decreased to 21.4% in dollars and 27.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In this regard, we note that sales in the second quarter of 2020 included the initial launch of Dragon Tea. We are reevaluating the viability of this SKU and the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased to 146.5% in dollars and 98.2% in local currencies.

In March 2019, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks, sued Monster, alleging that its Reign products infringed VPX's Bang trademarks and trade risk. A trial was held last year. And on August 3, 2021, the court issued an order denying all of VPX's claims and holding that VPX is entitled to no relief whatsoever. In fact, the court specifically found that VPX copied its bank trade risk from the original Monster Energy cans. The court's decision confirms that Monster and Poland retail partners are free to continue to sell our Reign products without any changes and without any restrictions. Monster always believed and maintained that VPX's claims were frivolous, and we are extremely pleased that the court projected all of VPX's claims while vindicating Monster's rights. As other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
Our new product introductions in the United States in the first half of 2021 were primarily focused in the first quarter. In the United States, during the second quarter of 2021 and we refreshed our can graphics on our rehab Monster brand family as well as our Full Throttle line, also updating the name for Blue Agave to TrueBlue. Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta received a refresh and updated CAM graphics as well as the name change to Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Manga. 
In May 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta in a 24-ounce option with an update to our Ultra Fiesta Manga plan for later this year. We are in the process of launching a new line of nonalcoholic pure energy sales under the True North brand name in 12-ounce lead cans, which contained an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. True North is being offered in 6 flavors, Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Lemonade, Water Mellon Mist, White Peach pair and Mandarin [indiscernible]. True North has a limited customer target in 2021 and with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. 
While cognizant of the can shortages, we believe that it is important to continue with our innovation plans. And to this end, we will be launching our new Flavors reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in Water Mellon and White Pine Apple in October 2021. We have deferred the launch of our new line of Java Monster cold brew coffee plus energy drinks until early 2022. 
In Canada, during the second quarter, we launched 2 new products: Monster Punch Papelon and Monster Punch chaotic, both in a 473 ml can. In April 2021, we launched RainOrange Dreamsicle in Puerto Rico and our second SKU in Bolivia with Monster Energy Zero Ultra. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Mean Green in May 2021. 
In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Juice Monster Pacific Punch and Monarch in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Paradise and Ultra Fiesta in a number of countries during the quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our strategic brand innovation and Predator in additional countries. 
In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market [indiscernible] ad in Australia following an exclusive lead launch with 1 chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Superfuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. 
During the 2021 second quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Sai or soft drinks. Additionally, we effected the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise and began shipments in anticipation of the launch of Super Fuel early in the 2021 third quarter. Super Fuel has just gone on the shelves in Japan this week. 
We also launched Mango Loco in Korea in July 2021. 
During the 2021 second quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. We also began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter of 2021, in China, we extended the national rollout of our new Monster Dragon Gold, which is noncarbonated. Our national summer on-pack promotion began in May with one of China's top consumer ambassadors. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our planned launches and innovation of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred for a few months. However, we still anticipate such launches taking place towards the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. 
We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had 1 less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. 
Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible. 
Additionally, the company also experienced delays in certain ingredients, which impacted supply. Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy drinks in a number of international countries during the year. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And then maybe, b, from a longer-term standpoint, it has been a couple of quarters now where the share losses have reaccelerated year-over-year just some progress in the beginning of the year. So I was just hoping you could review some of the key factors that have been driving the share losses in the U.S.?

We are not keeping up with our share, but our business is certainly growing. And you can track that from Nielsen. You can also track that from the nonmeasured channels, which are growing really very nicely. So while we're not keeping up necessarily with Red Bull in the in the major channels. As I've spoken on previous calls, Red Bull had a very large on-premise business, which has moved to off-premise and moved to off-premise during COVID. And that led to an acceleration in their share. 
However, we mentioned that we had and are continuing to sustain can issues and result in supply. And of course, that's having an impact on the share numbers that you are seeing. So I think on balance, the business is growing. You've seen the results. It's continuing to grow. And we are growing, but not at the extent of the market. I think with the full deck of cards, the situation may well be very different. But right now, we really are struggling with sufficient supplies of aluminum cans really to keep up with demand, which is, I suppose, a good position to be in. And on the other hand, is not such a good position to be in. The business is growing. And, that's the message I want to leave you with and other investors."

So those haven't got on to shelf. And then the 1 additional thing that I think that has negatively affected our distribution sales and distribution levels in the U.S. is labor shortages. And I think that what we've seen is that many of the bottlers, Coke bottlers are experiencing labor shortages. 
And while one would ordinarily say, well, everybody is going to have the same problem. I think that where you have Red Bull is I'm a competitor, they have a dedicated system. I think they've been able to address their labor shortages just more effectively than the larger bottlers with large labor pools. And that has also, I think, detrimentally affected our distribution levels going forward. 
But again, I think those are things that once things start settling down and things will get back to normality, that's something that I think that will also, in due course, rise itself."

Hilton, you just mentioned that you're optimistic. So just wanted to verify that you still expect some of these pressures to ease by Q4? Or do you think it's going to take a little bit longer, especially in light of the recent spike in aluminum prices. So trying to understand how that factors in? 
And then just a clarification on the can shortages that you mentioned that you're still experiencing, I guess it sounds like it's getting worse, but I really did want to clarify that. And is there any way that you guys could quantify how big of an impact the supply shortages had on your top line either in the quarter or in July? Just trying to understand how much you think your shipments would have been up in July without these shortages, for instance?"

I spoke about optimistic about can supplies. I really didn't talk about margins. You'll recall on the last call, I spoke about the issues that we were confronting with margin pressures like most other beverage companies. And where we are right now with aluminum, I mean, nobody knows. So you can talk to the leading banks in the field, which we do on a regular basis, and they really are pulls apart about their projections for aluminum in 2022, let alone 2021. 
So the last couple of days, you've seen a spike in the Midwest premium from this tax that is expected to be imposed on Russian aluminum. And as you know, the Midwest premium is strongly factors the last ton of aluminum to enter the U.S. and the cost of that. And so we've seen a spike in the Midwest premium. And we continue to see spikes in aluminum. 
So from that score, I think we just are in uncharted territory. I've been in this business for a long time, as you know, and I've never seen aluminum where it's at right now. And I've never seen the Midwest premium at these kind of levels. So aluminum, I really cannot talk about. 
And also when you look at our business and you look at the factors that really have affected gross margin, number one, the fact that we're selling a lot more internationally. So I talked earlier about 37.4% of our sales in the quarter outside of the U.S., 30% last year, that obviously impacts margins. 
We are importing cans from a number of cities, that obviously impacts margins. In fact, the China and India cans that we are using in the United States and in EMEA will only be filed in August in July, and they will be filled the [indiscernible]. So that in itself, the imputation will impact gross margins. 
And then to cap everything else, we have ingredient issues. We had ingredient issues, as we mentioned, in July, which again reduced the amount that we would actually sell because we didn't have sufficient ingredients to meet themselves, particularly with NOS. And so there are a number of factors that are increasing that are increasing our cost of goods. 
And last quarter, I said I didn't think that margins would get better in the second and third quarters. I read they will not -- I think margins will deteriorate in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're getting some relief in terms of supplies from the U.S. on cans that are -- have been contracted for and they were contracted for 2 years ago. And we saw the opportunity to work with 2 major suppliers to get additional cans produced in the U.S., and that's why we have 2 new supplies opening, and we are an important and an anchor customer of both those facilities. 
But even that, you're still dependent on aluminum. We have some hedges in place, but obviously not enough to take into consideration the amount of sales and the amount of consumer demand that is out there. 
So that's a long-winded way of saying, I think, answering your question as best as I can. 
And then just getting to your second question because you're really only allowed one. But to get to your second question, we have quantified or try to quantify the impact on can shortages in July and in this quarter and in the -- potentially in the third quarter, but I really don't want to -- I'm not comfortable with those numbers yet. A lot of detailed work is being done on them. And I just -- I can't in good contents give those numbers because we still are in the throes of kind of finalizing what we think is probably correct. 
Rodney mentioned in his script earlier that a number of the bottlers, he mentioned particularly in EMEA, but there were cases in the U.S. as well, and there was a substantial case in the U.S. where the bottlers were obviously focused on other things in the quarter and were producing Coca-Cola brands. And as a result, I think we -- our production got moved from July to August. 
So when I look at July, it doesn't -- I don't get overly concerned because I know the sales are going into August."

And we used the first half of the year to build up can inventories and finished product inventories with ourselves and our bottlers. Earlier this year, obviously, demand sort of was strong, and so we really didn't have that opportunity. 
So what has happened is that in June and July, which is your normal peak months, the demand has been higher, but our supply has been more level until we can get more can inventories into the market. So what happened is just that we have had a sort of a heartened increased shortage in the last month and July and probably will be a little bit in August. And then obviously, as we start increasing our -- the cans we're getting in, and then we're able to balance it more and our demand balances more, we'll start to have less of a different delta between these demand and supplier and eventually be able to -- we're hoping to able to build up our inventories and supply back to normal by the end of the fourth quarter -- or during or by the end of the fourth quarter."

The company's top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company's bottlers and distributors have in part been negatively affected for varying periods of time.
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months.
The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with 2 new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year. Logistical issues, including shortages of shipping containers and port of entry congestion could delay ongoing international supply of aluminum cans.
Separately, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies as well as significant increases in domestic and international freight costs and, like other beverage companies, are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment, all of which in addition to other factors, will continue to adversely impact gross margin percentages.
In the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.46 billion compared with $1.09 billion in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 33.6%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 second quarter would have been up 30.1%.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 second quarter was 57.2% compared with 60.3% in the 2020 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021, was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and increased input costs, mainly increased raw material freight-in costs and aluminum can costs.
Operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were $310.9 million compared with $252.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were 21.3% compared with 23.1% in the 2020 second quarter. Operating income increased 29.1% to $526 million, up from $407.3 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Net income increased 29.7% and to $403.8 million compared to $311.4 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 second quarter increased 28.6% and to $0.75 from $0.59 in the second quarter of 2020.
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 24, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 14.2% versus the same period a year ago.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were $546.3 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 second quarter compared to $328.3 million or 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $38.6 million in the 2021 second quarter.
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased 105.7% in dollars and increased 86.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 39.8% compared to 38.1% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a favorable country and product mix.
We're also pleased that in the 2021 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased 5.2% in dollars and decreased 0.1 of a percent in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.4% versus 43.3% over the same period in 2020.
In Japan, net sales in the 2021 second quarter decreased 15.1% in dollars and 13.9% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. Depletions increased 7% during the quarter. Monster remains the market leader in Japan for the month of June 2021. In South Korea, net sales increased 63% in dollars and 50.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020.

In this regard, we note that sales in the second quarter of 2020 included the initial launch of Dragon Tea. We are reevaluating the viability of this SKU and the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased to 146.5% in dollars and 98.2% in local currencies.

In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased by 194.9% in dollars and 201.7% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 77.5% in dollars and 52% in local currency in the 2021 second quarter.

In March 2019, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks, sued Monster, alleging that its Reign products infringed VPX's Bang trademarks and trade dress. A trial was held last year. And on August 3, 2021, the court issued an order denying all of VPX's claims and holding that VPX is entitled to no relief whatsoever. In fact, the court specifically found that VPX copied its Bang trade dress from the original Monster Energy cans. The court's decision confirms that Monster and its bottler and retail partners are free to continue to sell our Reign products without any changes and without any restrictions.
Monster always believed and maintained that VPX's claims were frivolous, and we are extremely pleased that the court projected all of VPX's claims while vindicating Monster's rights. As other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.
Our new product introductions in the United States in the first half of 2021 were primarily focused in the first quarter. In the United States, during the second quarter of 2021 and we refreshed our can graphics on our Rehab Monster brand family as well as our Full Throttle line, also updating the name for Blue Agave to TrueBlue. Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta received a refresh and updated can graphics as well as the name change to Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango.
In May 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta in a 24-ounce option with an update to our Ultra Fiesta Mango plan for later this year. We are in the process of launching a new line of nonalcoholic Pure Energy Seltzer under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which contained an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. True North is being offered in 6 flavors, Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Lemonade, Watermelon Mist, White Peach Pear and Mandarin Yuzu. True North has a limited customer target in 2021 and with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022.
While cognizant of the can shortages, we believe that it is important to continue with our innovation plans. And to this end, we will be launching our new flavorsome reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in Watermelon and White Pineapple in October 2021. We have deferred the launch of our new line of Java Monster cold brew coffee plus energy drinks until early 2022.
In Canada, during the second quarter, we launched 2 new products: Monster Punch Papillon and Monster Punch Khaotic, both in a 473 ml can. In April 2021, we launched Reign Orange Dreamsicle in Puerto Rico and our second SKU in Bolivia with Monster Energy Zero Ultra. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Mean Green in May 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Juice Monster Pacific Punch and Monarch in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Paradise and Ultra Fiesta in a number of countries during the quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our strategic brand innovation and Predator in additional countries.
In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia following an exclusive lead launch with 1 chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors.
During the 2021 second quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we effected the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise and began shipments in anticipation of the launch of Super Fuel early in the 2021 third quarter. Super Fuel has just gone on the shelves in Japan this week.
We also launched Mango Loco in Korea in July 2021.
During the 2021 second quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. We also began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter of 2021, in China, we extended the national rollout of our new Monster Dragon Gold, which is noncarbonated. Our national summer on-pack promotion began in May with one of China's top consumer ambassadors.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our planned launches and innovation of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred for a few months. However, we still anticipate such launches taking place towards the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.
We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had 1 less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis.
Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible.
Additionally, the company also experienced delays in certain ingredients, which impacted supply. Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. 
We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy drinks in a number of international countries during the year.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And then maybe, b, from a longer-term standpoint, it has been a couple of quarters now where the share losses have reaccelerated year-over-year just some progress in the beginning of the year.

We are not keeping up with our share, but our business is certainly growing. And you can track that from Nielsen. You can also track that from the nonmeasured channels, which are growing really very nicely. So while we're not keeping up necessarily with Red Bull in the in the major channels. As I've spoken on previous calls, Red Bull had a very large on-premise business, which has moved to off-premise and moved to off-premise during COVID. And that led to an acceleration in their share.
However, we mentioned that we had and are continuing to sustain can issues and result in supply. And of course, that's having an impact on the share numbers that you are seeing. So I think on balance, the business is growing. You've seen the results. It's continuing to grow. And we are growing, but not at the extent of the market. I think with the full deck of cards, the situation may well be very different. But right now, we really are struggling with sufficient supplies of aluminum cans really to keep up with demand, which is, I suppose, a good position to be in. And on the other hand, is not such a good position to be in. The business is growing. And, that's the message I want to leave you with and other investors."

So those haven't got on to shelf. And then the one additional thing that I think that has negatively affected our distribution -- sales and distribution levels in the U.S. is labor shortages. And I think that what we've seen is that many of the bottlers, Coke bottlers are experiencing labor shortages.
And while one would ordinarily say, well, everybody is going to have the same problem. I think that where you have Red Bull as our main competitor, they have a dedicated system. I think they've been able to address their labor shortages just more effectively than the larger bottlers with large labor pools. And that has also, I think, detrimentally affected our distribution levels going forward.
But again, I think those are things that once things start settling down and things will get back to normality, that's something that I think that will also, in due course, rights itself."

Hilton, you just mentioned that you're optimistic. So just wanted to verify that you still expect some of these pressures to ease by Q4. Or do you think it's going to take a little bit longer, especially in light of the recent spike in aluminum prices? So trying to understand how that factors in.
And then just a clarification on the can shortages that you mentioned that you're still experiencing, I guess it sounds like it's getting worse, but I really did want to clarify that. And is there any way that you guys could quantify how big of an impact the supply shortages had on your top line either in the quarter or in July? Just trying to understand how much you think your shipments would have been up in July without these shortages, for instance."

So let me deal with the first issue first, if I may. I spoke about optimistic about can supplies. I really didn't talk about margins. You'll recall on the last call, I spoke about the issues that we were confronting with margin pressures like most o",735,"Okay. So let me deal with the first issue first, if I may. I spoke about optimistic about can supplies. I really didn't talk about margins. You'll recall on the last call, I spoke about the issues that we were confronting with margin pressures like most other beverage companies. And where we are right now with aluminum, I mean, nobody knows. So you can talk to the leading banks in the field, which we do on a regular basis, and they really are poles apart about their projections for aluminum in 2022, let alone 2021.
So the last couple of days, you've seen a spike in the Midwest Premium from this tax that is expected to be imposed on Russian Aluminum. And as you know, the Midwest Premium is strongly factors the last ton of aluminum to enter the U.S. and the cost of that. And so we've seen a spike in the Midwest Premium. And we continue to see spikes in aluminum.
So from that score, I think we just are in uncharted territory. I've been in this business for a long time, as you know, and I've never seen aluminum where it's at right now. And I've never seen the Midwest Premium at these kind of levels. So aluminum, I really cannot talk about.
And also when you look at our business and you look at the factors that really have affected gross margin, number one, the fact that we're selling a lot more internationally. So I talked earlier about 37.4% of our sales in this quarter outside of the U.S., 30% last year, that obviously impacts margins.
We are importing cans from a number of countries, that obviously impacts margins. In fact, the China and India cans that we are using in the United States and in EMEA will only be filed in August in July, and they will be filled the this month. So that in itself, the imputation will impact gross margins.
And then to cap everything else, we have ingredient issues. We had ingredient issues, as we mentioned, in July, which again reduced the amount that we would actually sell because we didn't have sufficient ingredients to meet themselves, particularly with NOS. And so there are a number of factors that are increasing our cost of goods.
And last quarter, I said I didn't think that margins would get better in the second and third quarters. I read they will not -- I think margins will deteriorate in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're getting some relief in terms of supplies from the U.S. on cans that are -- have been contracted for and they were contracted for 2 years ago. And we saw the opportunity to work with 2 major suppliers to get additional cans produced in the U.S., and that's why we have 2 new supplies opening, and we are an important and an anchor customer of both those facilities.
But even that, you're still dependent on aluminum. We have some hedges in place, but obviously not enough to take into consideration the amount of sales and the amount of consumer demand that is out there. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I think, answering your question as best as I can.
And then just getting to your second question because you're really only allowed one. But to get to your second question, we have quantified or try to quantify the impact on can shortages in July and in this quarter and in the -- potentially in the third quarter, but I really don't want to -- I'm not comfortable with those numbers yet. A lot of detailed work is being done on them. And I just -- I can't in good conscience give those numbers because we still are in the throes of kind of finalizing what we think is probably correct.
Rodney mentioned in his script earlier that a number of the bottlers, he mentioned particularly in EMEA, but there were cases in the U.S. as well, and there was a substantial case in the U.S. where the bottlers were obviously focused on other things in the quarter and were producing Coca-Cola brands. And as a result, I think we -- our production got moved from July to August. So when I look at July, it doesn't -- I don't get overly concerned because I know the sales are going into August."

When we buy cans in contracted for our annual amounts, they usually are sort of reasonably flat lined across the year. And we use the first half of the year to build up can inventories and finished product inventories with ourselves and our bottlers. Earlier this year, obviously, demand sort of was strong, and so we really didn't have that opportunity.
So what has happened is that in June and July, which is your normal peak months, the demand has been higher, but our supply has been more level until we can get more can inventories into the market. So what happened is just that we have had a sort of a heartened increased shortage in the last month, in July and probably will be a little bit in August. And then obviously, as we start increasing our -- the cans we're getting in, and then we're able to balance it more and our demand balances more, we'll start to have less of a different delta between these demand and supplier, and eventually be able to -- we're hoping to able to build up our inventories and supply back to normal by the end of the fourth quarter -- or during or by the end of the fourth quarter."

And obviously, the one goes into cost of sales and freight out goes into operating expenses. So that's why you'll see freight really hitting both of those line items."

Last time around, as I mentioned on previous calls, we went out alone, and we would like to be in a situation this time where we followed our competitor, but we have to evaluate, obviously, the business as we see it and the impact for us.
What we've done is we're reducing our promotional allowances. So we're taking a price increase the other way through reducing promotional allowances, but the impact of that reduction in the second quarter was not as we would have liked. So we are -- we really put the accelerator down and are more aggressive in reducing our promotional allowances. But we are continuing to evaluate the pricing and price increases.
And then I have to leave this call with my favorite saying, and that is, we don't bank gross profit margins, we bank gross profit dollars. And to me, the fact that we're doing everything we can to satisfy our customers as best as we can is impacting gross profit margins. But at the end of the day, we don't want to lose gross profit dollars, which is really important to ensure the sustainability of the brand. And that's the most important thing for us right now."

Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South",3795,"Thank you, Tom. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However, the company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA. As a result, the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand in the United States and EMEA in the 2021 third quarter. 
During the 2021 third quarter, the company continued to experience increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing and costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the company experienced increased ingredient and input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials and increased outbound freight costs, all of which resulted in increased cost of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 third quarter. 
The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory. And we have and are in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs. 
In the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.41 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 13.2%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 third quarter would have been up 11.9%. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 third quarter was 55.9% compared with 59.1% in the 2020 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans, logistical costs and geographical sales mix. 
Operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter was $344.7 million compared with $277.9 million in the 2020 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were 24.4% compared with 22.3% in the 2020 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. In particular, operating costs were adversely affected by increased logistical inefficiencies, including higher freight out and warehousing costs, a onetime distributor termination fee of $5.3 million and increased selling and marketing expenses, including the resumption of certain sponsorship and event activities as compared to the same quarter last year. A number of sponsorship activities were canceled in the comparable quarter last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Operating income increased 3.1% to $444.5 million from $458.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased input costs, increased transportation, increased selling expenses and a onetime distributed termination fee of $5.3 million. Net income decreased 3% to $337.2 million as compared to $347.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 third quarter decreased 3.5% to $0.63 from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2020. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 23, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 12.8% versus the same period a year ago.

It is important to note that with regard to the decrease in sales of NOS, during the third quarter, we experienced shortages in the supply of concentrate for NOS, which resulted in reduced production, reduced sales and lack of product availability at retail. 
The nonsupplier issues are improving. Sales of Red Bull increased 15.6%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 12.5% and sales of 5-Hour increased 3%. VPX Bang sales increased 5.1%.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300, was 7.1% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 5% lower.

Monster's market share in value decreased 2.5 points to 26.2% against the comparable period the previous year.

Amper sales increased 55.5%, and its market share increased 3.4 points to 18.2%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2021 compared to September 2020, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 44.2% to 47.6%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 33% to 37.6% and now trails Red Bull by only 3.3 points. In Chile, although Monster's net sales in the third quarter were 34% higher, its retail market share for the month of September decreased from 46.6% to 42.2% due to robust growth in the energy category in Chile, which has grown 65% for the month of September 2021. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

In the 2021 third quarter, sales in EMEA were adversely impacted by can and concentrate supply issues and manufacturing capacity constraints, which caused out of stocks in many markets. United Kingdom and certain other countries in EMEA were more adversely affected. Truck shortages also exacerbated our ability to supply and the ability of our bottlers to deliver products to their customers. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of August 2021, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 9.8% to 18.6% in Kenya and from 0% to 12.2% in Nigeria.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $527.4 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 third quarter compared to $444.5 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $16.4 million in the 2021 third quarter.

In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 22.9% in dollars and increased 17.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to an unfavorable country product mix and can freight and raw material airfreight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.4%. 
Can supply shortages exacerbated by production disruptions at a major supplier in EMEA, lack of ingredient availability, insufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in the third quarter in EMEA, in some cases, impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. The company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply train. 
We are also pleased that in the 2021 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 1.6% in dollars and decreased 2.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.5% versus 43.2% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 0.7 of a percent in dollars and 1.7% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. In South Korea, net sales increased 21.1% in dollars and 15.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. 
In China, net sales decreased 13.5% in dollars and 20.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are reevaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 8.6% in dollars and 13.6% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 57.6% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41% compared to 42.9% over the same period in 2020.

In the United States, we successfully launched our new True North Pure Energy Seltzer line in e-commerce and selected channels and will launch nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter of 2022. In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of Monster Energy Drinks in 2 flavors, watermelon and white pineapple. In Canada, during July 2021, we successfully launched our Monster Energy Rehab line in 3 flavors, rehab tea plus lemonade, peach tea and strawberry lemonade. 
We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the third quarter of 2021, including Monster Zero Ultra in Paraguay, Monster Energy Zero Sugar in Peru, Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango in Puerto Rico and Monster Ultra Watermelon in the Caribbean. In the 2021 third quarter, we expanded our Predator Gold Strike footprint in Mexico by launching in a 355 ml slim can. In Brazil, we also launched Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mangomatic within a limited territory. We are planning a national launch of all of these products in the first quarter of 2022. 
In the 2021 third quarter in Australia, we launched 2 new products in Mother Sugar Free, Razzle Berry and Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Fiesta and Juice Monster Monarch in a number of countries during the 2021 third quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our Strategic Brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator malt flavor energy drink in Nigeria. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Super Fuel, Blue Streak and Red Dog in July in Japan. Additionally, in October 2021, we relaunched Monster Rossi in Japan. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the region, certain of our planned launches of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred until 2022. However, Predator is anticipated to launch later this month in Vietnam. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. 
We estimate October 2021 sales to be approximately 8.3% higher than in October 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2021 sales would have been approximately 7.9% higher than the comparable October 2020 sales. October 2021 had 1 less selling day than October 2020. We Additionally, the company continued to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory. And we have and are already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs. 
Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region, which will improve service levels in EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio, internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So we have a department called Revenue Growth Management that balances pricing and balances promotions in line with the expectations that we set for the business and for our brands. So we've been working very closely and started in this quarter, in fact, slightly before this last quarter, in cutting back promotions and using them very judiciously. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have plans for 2022, which involve changing retail pricing on shelves, which leads to, obviously, a reduction in promotions. And we don't rule out the possibility of a full price increase later on in 2022. But we keep our options open. 
We prefer to accomplish the objective through reductions in promotions, but we have to see what the cost environment looks like going into 2022. Obviously, if you haven't got product and you short a product, it doesn't make sense to promote extensively, but we still have to promote in order to fulfill the contracts that we've had this year with our customers and our retailers, which were set at the beginning of the year. And so some cannot be changed. And as we move into 2022, adjust pricing through promotions and/or price increases."

There's Coke as a corporate partner and there's also the individual Coke bottlers. I think that our relationship with Coke is fine. I think there's no issue. It's a good relationship. I think that with the bottlers, our relationships, again, are also good. But I think the bottlers have been struggling a little bit, as you know, with labor issues and cost issues as well. And that has sort of affected, I think, the level of service to smaller accounts and infill activities. And that's where that has perhaps disproportionately hurt our brand over this whole pandemic period. 
And that's something that we are addressing, particularly when you compare that to -- not against other similar systems but against Red Bull which has its own dedicated system out there. And so we are taking steps to address that. We have our own field force that we've implemented to supplement and assist the bottlers. But even that, our own field force is suffering from labor issues and trying to hire people. It's not been easy. We have a number of open positions. But we are -- actually, we've seen good success from what we've implemented and we actually are expanding our own field team. And we're going to do that in conjunction with the bottlers. 
But that's part of the challenges that we've had on supply chain and part of the challenges we've had which have affected ourselves have been just inefficiencies getting products on shelf. And it's -- and there are -- in different parts of the country and different parts of the world even, it varies. And in some cases, you see empty shelves or you see shelves that haven't been refilled, which is obviously heartbreaking for us, and we're trying to address it. But that is something we are facing, and that's been a labor issue that many of our bottlers are going through at the moment. But hopefully -- we are trying to work out ways of improving, and hopefully, that will start improving going forward. 
But despite that, we've been able to continue to manage a pretty healthy increase in sales, and it's just meeting the increased demand that has been a big challenge. And again, we're working with our bottlers to try and achieve what we can. So it's a tough environment for our bottlers when also we can't supply all of their orders and we pull them in full. And that's been difficult for us to juggle deliveries around the country, and it resulted in increased costs out of orbit and in delivering products out of our normal ranges in order to make sure we're trying to maximize deliveries to bottlers."

So if you look at where we are with COGS, it's really a difficult situation right now because I don't know where, for example, aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum will know that the aluminum price is significantly -- the LME and the Midwest premium is significantly higher than last year. In fact, it's up by almost 70% from the similar quarter in the previous year. So then I turn to what's happened in aluminum. So in the middle of October, we ended up with the highest price we've ever seen for aluminum in the Midwest premium. And that's now fallen 15% from its high, and now it's likely the end of October. 
So we don't know what's happening with aluminum. What we do know is that we have substantial quantities of cans. We have 2 new manufacturers that have opened in the U.S. and are beginning to supply us. So that's a fact. And we have also opened a number of additional co-packing facilities, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So the cans are coming in. We have new co-packing capacity. And what I'm hoping is that this inefficient freight that we've been experienced, we spoke on previous calls about operating within orbits, to minimize cost of distribution and cost of freight in. So now we've broken those orbits because we haven't had capacity, and we've been actually trying to service every case we can. 
So I'm hoping that in the fourth quarter, and it's October already, that with these new co-packers opening up, with the can capacity that we have that we will start mitigating these inefficient freight costs that we are experiencing. But I can't talk about aluminum because I don't know what's happening with aluminum. And we were very careful not to buy forward on aluminum, which we normally do as a can company because we were nervous about what was going to happen. So that's where we are in the fourth quarter. Certainly, things are improving, but I cannot say that they are totally solved. 
And in Europe, we've opened up also a number of new co-packers. We're getting cans in Europe from India and from China. So even the European situation is being alleviated, I would say, if you compare it to the third quarter, I suspect we will have less issues in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter, if that answers your question."

Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South",3787,"Thank you, Tom. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However, the company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA. As a result, the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand in the United States and EMEA in the 2021 third quarter. 
During the 2021 third quarter, the company continued to experience increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing and costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the company experienced increased ingredient and input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials and increased outbound freight costs, all of which resulted in increased cost of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 third quarter. 
The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory. And we have and are in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs. 
In the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.41 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 13.2%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 third quarter would have been up 11.9%. 
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 third quarter, was 55.9% compared with 59.1% in the 2020 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans, logistical costs and geographical sales mix. 
Operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter was $344.7 million compared with $277.9 million in the 2020 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were 24.4% compared with 22.3% in the 2020 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. In particular, operating costs were adversely affected by increased logistical inefficiencies, including higher freight out and warehousing costs, a onetime distributor termination fee of $5.3 million and increased selling and marketing expenses, including the resumption of certain sponsorship and event activities as compared to the same quarter last year. A number of sponsorship activities were canceled in the comparable quarter last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Operating income increased (sic) [ decreased ] 3.1% to $444.5 million from $458.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased input costs, increased transportation, increased selling expenses and a onetime distributed termination fee of $5.3 million.

Monster's market share in value decreased 2.5 points to 26.2% against the comparable period the previous year.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2021 compared to September 2020, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 44.2% to 47.6%.

In Chile, although Monster's net sales in the third quarter were 34% higher, its retail market share for the month of September decreased from 46.6% to 42.2% due to robust growth in the energy category in Chile, which has grown 65% for the month of September 2021. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

In the 2021 third quarter, sales in EMEA were adversely impacted by can and concentrate supply issues and manufacturing capacity constraints, which caused out of stocks in many markets. United Kingdom and certain other countries in EMEA were more adversely affected. Truck shortages also exacerbated our ability to supply and the ability of our bottlers to deliver products to their customers. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of August 2021, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 9.8% to 18.6% in Kenya and from 0% to 12.2% in Nigeria. We launched our new Predator malt flavor energy drink in Nigeria during the third quarter. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $527.4 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 third quarter compared to $444.5 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $16.4 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 22.9% in dollars and increased 17.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to an unfavorable country product mix and can freight and raw material airfreight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.4%. 
Can supply shortages exacerbated by production disruptions at a major supplier in EMEA, lack of ingredient availability, insufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in the third quarter in EMEA, in some cases, impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. The company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply train. 
We are also pleased that in the 2021 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 1.6% in dollars and decreased 2.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.5% versus 43.2% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 0.7 of 1% in dollars and 1.7% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. In South Korea, net sales increased 21.1% in dollars and 15.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. 
In China, net sales decreased 13.5% in dollars and 20.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are reevaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. 
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 8.6% in dollars and 13.6% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 57.6% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41% compared to 42.9% over the same period in 2020.

There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX, but as they are subdued okay, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
In the United States, we successfully launched our new True North, Pure Energy Seltzer line in e-commerce and selected channels, and will launch nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter of 2022. In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in 2 flavors, watermelon and white pineapple. In Canada, during July 2021, we successfully launched our Monster Energy Rehab line in 3 flavors, Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade, Peach Tea and Strawberry Lemonade. 
We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the third quarter of 2021, including Monster Zero Ultra in Paraguay, Monster Energy Zero Sugar in Peru, Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango in Puerto Rico and Monster Ultra Watermelon in the Caribbean. In the 2021 third quarter, we expanded our Predator Gold Strike footprint in Mexico by launching in a 355 ml slim can. In Brazil, we also launched Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mang-O-Matic within a limited territory. We are planning a national launch of all of these products in the first quarter of 2022. 
In the 2021 third quarter in Australia, we launched 2 new products in Mother Sugar Free, Razzle Berry and Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Fiesta and Juiced Monster Monarch in a number of countries during the 2021 third quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our Strategic Brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator Malt Flavored Energy Drink in Nigeria. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Super Fuel, Blue Streak and Red Dawg in July in Japan. Additionally, in October 2021, we relaunched Monster Rossi in Japan. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the region, certain of our planned launches of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred until 2022. However, Predator is anticipated to launch later this month in Vietnam. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. 
We estimate October 2021 sales to be approximately 8.3% higher than in October 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2021 sales would have been approximately 7.9% higher than the comparable October 2020 sales. October 2021 had one less selling day than October 2020. We Additionally, the company continued to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory. And we have and are already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs. 
Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region, which will improve service levels in EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio, internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So we have a department called Revenue Growth Management that balances pricing and balances promotions in line with the expectations that we set for the business and for our brands. So we've been working very closely and started in this quarter, in fact, slightly before this last quarter, in cutting back promotions and using them very judiciously. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have plans for 2022, which involve changing retail pricing on shelves, which leads to, obviously, a reduction in promotions. And we don't rule out the possibility of a full price increase later on in 2022. But we keep our options open. 
We prefer to accomplish the objective through reductions in promotions, but we have to see what the cost environment looks like going into 2022. Obviously, if you haven't got product and you short a product, it doesn't make sense to promote extensively, but we still have to promote in order to fulfill the contracts that we've had this year with our customers and our retailers, which were set at the beginning of the year. And so some cannot be changed. And as we move into 2022, adjust pricing through promotions and/or price increases."

And that's something that we are addressing, particularly when you compare that to -- not against other similar systems but against Red Bull which has its own dedicated system out there. And so we are taking steps to address that. We have our own field force that we've implemented to supplement and assist the bottlers. But even that, our own field force is suffering from labor issues and trying to hire people. It's not been easy. We have a number of open positions. But we are -- actually, we've seen good success from what we've implemented and we actually are expanding our own field team. And we're going to do that in conjunction with the bottlers. 
But that's part of the challenges that we've had are supply chain and part of the challenges we've had, which have affected ourselves, have been just inefficiencies getting products on shelf. And it's -- and there are different -- in different parts of the country and different parts of the world even, it varies. And in some cases, you see empty shelves or you see shelves that haven't been refilled, which is obviously heartbreaking for us, and we're trying to address it. But that is something we are facing, and that's been a labor issue that many of our bottlers are going through at the moment. But hopefully -- we are trying to work out ways of improving, and hopefully, that will start improving going forward. 
But despite that, we've been able to continue to manage a pretty healthy increase in sales, and it's just meeting the increased demand that has been a big challenge. And again, we're working with our bottlers to try and achieve what we can. So it's a tough environment for our bottlers when also we can't supply all of their orders and we pull them in full. And that's been difficult for us to juggle deliveries around the country, and it resulted in increased costs out of orbit and in delivering products out of our normal ranges in order to make sure we're trying to maximize deliveries to bottlers."

So if you look at where we are with COGS, it's really a difficult situation right now because I don't know where, for example, aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum will know that the aluminum price is significantly -- t",412,"Right. So if you look at where we are with COGS, it's really a difficult situation right now because I don't know where, for example, aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum will know that the aluminum price is significantly -- the LME and the Midwest Premium is significantly higher than last year. In fact, it's up by almost 70% from the similar quarter in the previous year. So then I turn to what's happened in aluminum. So in the middle of October, we ended up with the highest price we've ever seen for aluminum in the Midwest Premium. And that's now fallen 15% from its high, and now it's likely the end of October. 
So we don't know what's happening with aluminum. What we do know is that we have substantial quantities of cans. We have 2 new manufacturers that have opened in the U.S. and are beginning to supply us. So that's a fact. And we have also opened a number of additional co-packing facilities, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So the cans are coming in. We have new co-packing capacity. And what I'm hoping is that this inefficient freight that we've been experienced, we spoke on previous calls about operating within orbits, to minimize cost of distribution and cost of freight in. So now we've broken those orbits because we haven't had capacity, and we've been actually trying to service every case we can. 
So I'm hoping that in the fourth quarter, and it's October already, that with these new co-packers opening up, with the can capacity that we have that we will start mitigating these inefficient freight costs that we are experiencing. But I can't talk about aluminum because I don't know what's happening with aluminum. And we were very careful not to buy forward on aluminum, which we normally do as a can company because we were nervous about what was going to happen. So that's where we are in the fourth quarter. Certainly, things are improving, but I cannot say that they are totally solved. 
And in Europe, we've opened up also a number of new co-packers. We're getting cans in Europe from India and from China. So even the European situation is being alleviated. I would say, if you compare it to the third quarter, I suspect we will have less issues in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter, if that answers your question."

The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely.",4335,"Thank you, Tom. The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants.
Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating.
Certain of the company's bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company's products remain generally available to consumers.
In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption.  
The company's sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company's largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third and fourth quarters. The company's sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages and its supply chain remains intact.
Company is continually addressing the increase in its aluminum can requirements, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan.  
We will refer to this on our call as product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which was partially offset by favorable product mix.  
Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared with $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily due to decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing.
Operating income increased 26.9% to $402.3 million, up from $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 35.5% to $429.6 million from $317 million in the 2019 fourth quarter.
Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets.
Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 28.9% to $328.6 million from $255 million in the 2019 fourth quarter.  
Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5% to $0.88 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 30.6% to $0.62 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 were 26.7% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.5% higher. Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks, Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended February 13, 2021, was 52.9%, up 3.4 points, while Starbucks Energy share remained at 44.6%.

According to Nielsen in all measured channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 30, 2021, the energy drink category increased 15.2% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 24.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 41.3%, up 3.2 points.

Predator, which was launched in March 2020 achieved a market share of 2.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. 
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen for the month of December 2020 compared to December 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 34% to 45.5%; in Brazil from 25.2% to 32.2%; and in Chile from 40.3% to 47.2%. 
Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.8% to 15.4% in Belgium; from 28.3% to 31.1% in France; from 22% to 27.3% in Great Britain; and from 6.1% to 7.9% in the Netherlands. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of December 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.2% in the Czech Republic, from 22.9% to 26.3% in Denmark, from 34.7% to 37.7% increase, from 20.3% to 27.9% in Italy from 24.2% to 30.5% in Norway, from 14.3% to 21% in Poland, from 22.9% to 28.2% in the Republic of Ireland, from 18.1% to 21% in South Africa, from 35.5% to 37.3% in Spain, and from 12.7% to 14.4% in Sweden, and declined from 16.4% to 16% in Germany. 
Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending January 17, 2021, increased from 9.4% to 12.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13% to 12.2% during the same period.

Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 8.1% to 7%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.2% to 6.1%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the 4 weeks ended January 3, 2021, decreased from 24% to 23.9%. 
According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of December 2020 grew from 52% to 56.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. 
According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of December 2020 decreased from 55.5% to 49.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the impact of the product returns in Japan as well as initial trial sales following the launch of new products by 2 large competitors. 
Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain markets statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. 
We are seeing some recent softness in the performance Energy category in the U.S., which we are reviewing. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $384.8 million, 32.2% of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $319.5 million or 31.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the product returns. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.1 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. 
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Net sales adjusted for the product returns in this region increased 30.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currencies.

Since our last earnings call in November 2020, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the maker of Bang Energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. 
In early October 2020, in the United States, we launched Ultra Watermelon and Juice Monster Papillon to the trade. We also refreshed our Juice Monster Khaos SKU into the new Juice Monster Khaotic. Initial results are positive. In late January 2021 in the United States, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno, Watermelon Warlord to the trade. 
We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4 pack. In late February 2021, we launched our core 4 flavors, Monster Green, Lo-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise, in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service. 
In Canada, in January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta and Java Monster with Oat Milk. February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, and we launched Mean Green -- and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. 
We were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the 2020 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets have recently reintroduced lockdowns which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. 
Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Botswana in November 2020 and in Israel in January 2021 and is now available in 40 markets across EMEA. 
Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Italy in February 2021 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra was launched in Serbia and Ukraine in October 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. 
Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is now available in 22 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Fiesta was launched in Great Britain and Sweden in January 2021 and in Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland and Spain in February 2021. The Monster Ultra Black was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020, it is now available in 2 EMEA markets. 
Monster, The Doctor was launched in Kenya in December 2020. It is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Mule was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020 and in Great Britain and Iceland in January 2021 and in Austria, Belgium and Norway in February 2021. Monster Mule is now available in 10 EMEA markets.
Burn Zero Rasberry was launched in Hungary in October 2020. Ultra Zero Raspberry was launched in Serbia in November 2020. Predator Purple Reign was launched in Namibia in December 2020, and it is now available in 3 EMEA markets. 
Rain Sour Apple variant was launched in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland in October 2020. In November 2020, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Rosa in Australia and New Zealand, in addition to BU Energy Island Punch in Papua New Guinea. China, we piloted our new noncarbonated Monster Energy Dragon's Gold in a number of provinces during the fourth quarter of 2020. Initial consumer feedback has been positive, and we will commence with the national rollout of Monster Energy Dragon's Gold during 2021. 
During the 2020 fourth quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon Tea along with Monster Energy Green and Monster Energy Ultra. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra and Monster Mango Loco in Singapore, Monster Mango Loco in Vietnam and Monster Energy Ultra in the Philippines. 
We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets in 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program.
As of February 25, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate January 2021 sales to be approximately 18.2% higher than in January 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, January 2021 sales would have been approximately 17.2% higher than comparable January 2020 sales.
January 2021 has had 2 fewer selling days in January 2020. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. 
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Two, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. 
Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year."

I mean in previous calls like this, I've spoken about the fact that we engage in contracts with aluminum can suppliers from time to time to fix some of our aluminum costs. And we've done a little bit of that for 2021. 
Obviously, we monitor aluminum costs every morning. And we've seen, as you've seen and the rest of the group have seen an increasing situation with regard to aluminum and also with the Midwest Premium, which I think has taken a lot of us by surprise. The aluminum, the Midwest Premium was in the upper single digits some months ago and with the imposition of the tariffs on aluminum went up and we -- everyone expected that to fall, and it hasn't.
It's just sitting at just below $0.16. So where we are, we're doing our best to manage our aluminum costs and I'm not sure there's much more I can say other than, yes, we will -- aluminum costs will increase over -- in 2021 over 2020. So that is -- that's a fact of life, and it will impact us as it will impact many other beverage companies. 
And regarding your second question about take your price increase. We're not -- at this time, we haven't been looking at taking a price increase. However, one never rules out, take your price increase when the right opportunity presents itself, and right now, none of our competitors have been looking at price increases. I know we led the market last time. But this time, we're cautious, as indeed, we should be with our market share. And we're examining the opportunities to take price up, and we will, if we find there's an opportunity to do so."

In terms of working with the Coca-Cola bottlers and working with the Coca-Cola system on procurement of cans, we're doing what we can to produce within the Coca-Cola network. Obviously, that's something that we like to do because it reduces shipping costs and improves efficiencies. 
But there are a whole bunch of products that we manufacture that cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. We do a wide range of products from hot fold to retort and those products cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. So where we can, we try and work with the system. And obviously, that's our major focus. And that's been improving over the years. We've opened up a number of Coca-Cola facilities to produce Monster. On the other hand, on procurement, which is a question you asked, that's been a longer-term project, and we haven't resolved that situation yet.
The Coke bottlers have their own organization, which is for the Coca-Cola bottling situation. We are not a bottler, and we don't fall within that mandate. So that's been a difficult discussion, and it's something that I'm hoping that we'll be able to progress in the future.
But right now, we're doing our own procurement of all our raw materials, including aluminum and including cans. So Rodney, you asked that you answer the second question, so go ahead."

But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. A",319,"Yes. On the second one, it varies from country to country, Mark. But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. And so we are continuing to expand the number of SKUs, but it does vary.
And in some countries, we're trying to start accelerating that instead of doing just one a year. We're actually increasing the pace of innovation going on shelves, but it does vary quite dramatically from country to country. 
And where we can get receptiveness from retailers to increase the energy space, we obviously take advantage of that and increase more. And so we did, as you would have noticed from the call, we went into quite a lot of depth in EMEA in places like of new products and where we're introducing new flavors because that pace is accelerating, but there is quite a long runway internationally for international markets to get up to the U.S. levels.
And there are many products that haven't yet been launched at all in the international market. So the rehab products are in very few markets internationally. We're just starting to launch some of the Hydro products. 
So there are a number of product lines or we call them as subfamilies that aren't yet in -- don't appear in many international markets at all. So there is opportunity there. But it all depends on the appetite of retailers and their willingness to grant additional space.
But I think that as we've seen everywhere, the category does increase sales -- on a sales per unit basis, it is a hiring in other -- a lot of other comparable beverages, competitive beverages. 
And so we are seeing a receptiveness from retailers to continually recognizing the category and increasing the allocation of space."

And then in some countries like in China, we've actually launched unique items that are not available in the U.S. In Brazil, we have a tea product, for example, that's also not available in the U.S. So there are a bunch of products under the Monster brand that are not available in the U.S. that are distributed internationally and of course, our strategic brands are in various countries in the world, many of those -- many of the flavors that we sell in other parts of the world are not available in the U.S. So it really is a mixed bag.
