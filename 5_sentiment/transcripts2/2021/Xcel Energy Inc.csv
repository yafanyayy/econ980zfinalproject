Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.
This morning, we'll review our 2020 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release.
I'm going to go off script for a second, which sites a little bit dangerous. But in December, Utility  have recognized Ben Fowke as utility executive of the year for his environmental leadership. Ben was the architect of our steel for fuel strategy Xcel. He's also the one that drove us to be the first utility to clear that we have an objective of 100% carbon-free by 2050. This is a well-deserved and overdue award.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities.
Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We're helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charting to support those in need including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them.
We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we've increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and have request to acquire the more wind fund. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic.
Now turning to our investment plan. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we're also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn't result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we'll move forward with it.
We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we're also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We're excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID.
We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I'm extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry.
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors.
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes. Higher AFPBC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction, including our wind generation, lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts, and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR and however, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral.
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share.
Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don't anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.
Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse coded impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sag Marlin farm. The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in new Mex system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS.
In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in 8 years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. As  Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Circo Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. The accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans are detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets.
And with that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the 16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We've reaffirmed the 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range.
With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we'll now take questions."

And I can't give you specifics in terms of the overall capital investment. We'll file that in the next month or so, but significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It's really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So I look and feel a lot like that. We're looking at what we're doing with our coal plants and adding a lot of renewables to help us achieve that 80% plan.

We delivered the Mower PPA buyout this year with the commission in this one. We continue to have conversations with our counterparties. I think there's another opportunity if you see potential tax credit extensions in Washington that you get some further repowering opportunities, but it's something that we continually look at and work on other counterparties. There's another good data point to watch is that our IRPs often drives RFPs, where we can have PPAs bid into us, PPA buyout opportunities. So that's a really good opportunity longer term. So what we're excited about it. We've delivered. If you look, we've delivered on our PPA buyout opportunity, we're counting this one that we just announced.

We're still prosecuting the wildfire writer. But there's a number of other factors that go into evaluation of our case in Colorado, and we're continuing to watch those. Obviously, the pace of economic recovery in Colorado is very important. We're seeing very strong growth there. But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and I would see our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado. It's likely in the second half outcome at the earliest. And it's largely associated with capital investments in the distribution business and enabling technologies for us to continue to deliver a great customer experience out there.

But as I said with the prior question, it's far more a question of technologies ready and economically viable because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability.

But honestly, I think it's a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the arising in front of us. So that said, I mean, there's a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we're aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you'll see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you'll see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it's 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we're going to do amazing things.

You're a little bit muffled, but I think you're asking about what's the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles.

And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Similarly, that's all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the 1 area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren't as sophisticated. We'd like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it's largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it's possible there's some incremental upside there.

So it's -- that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there's a lot of folks. I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he was -- he saw that future too because in the past, I've been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter.

So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call.

So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. 
Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We're helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to chartable giving to support those in need including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. 
We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we've increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I've requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. 
Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we're also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn't result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we'll move forward with it. 
We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. 
As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we're also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030.  We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. 
These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We're excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. 
We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I'm extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. 
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. 
We're also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. 
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction, including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. 
Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don't anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. 
Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sag Marlin farm. 
The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of [ $ ] 1.9 billion in historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. 
In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in 8 years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. 
We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. 
As  Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. 
Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
And with that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the 16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. 
Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We've reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. 
With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we'll now take questions."

So what you'll see out of that, and I can't give you specifics in terms of the overall capital investment. We'll file that in the next month or so. But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It's really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. 
On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that.

I think there's another opportunity if you see potential tax credit extensions in Washington that you get some further repowering opportunities, but it's something that we continually look at and work on other counterparties. 
There's another good data point to watch is that our IRPs often drives RFPs, where we can have PPAs bid into us, PPA buyout opportunities. So that's a really good opportunity longer term. So what we're excited about it. We've delivered. If you look, we've delivered on our PPA buyout opportunity, we're counting this one that we just announced.

But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado.

And then just going back to Jeremy's question on President Biden's plans to achieve the carbon pollution free power sector in the year 2035.

But as I said with the prior question, it's far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from  fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. 
So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 s like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there's going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I've always said, we'll move as fast as the speed of technology and that's what we'll do. But honestly, I think it's a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. 
So that said, I mean, there's a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we're aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you'll see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you'll see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it's 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we're going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we'd be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just 5 years ago. So I'm excited about what the future possibilities hold."

Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that's probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it."

Maybe I'll start this, and then I'll kick it over to Brian potentially. You're a little bit muffled, but I think you're asking about what's the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next 5 years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. 
Similarly, that's all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren't as sophisticated. We'd like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it's largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it's possible there's some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn't say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come."

So it's -- that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there's a lot of folks. 
I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he was -- he saw that future too because in the past, I've been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we're ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid."

So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. 
Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We're helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charitable giving to support those in need, including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. 
We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we've increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I've requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. 
Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we're also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn't result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we'll move forward with it. 
We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. 
As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we're also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. 
These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We're excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. 
We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I'm extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. 
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. 
We're also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. 
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction, including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. 
Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don't anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. 
Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sagamore Wind farm. 
The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in a historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. 
In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in 8 years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. 
We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. 
As Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. 
Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
And with that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the 16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. 
Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We've reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. 
With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we'll now take questions."

But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It's really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. 
On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that.

But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado.

But as I said with the prior question, it's far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. 
So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 s like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there's going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I've always said, we'll move as fast as the speed of technology and that's what we'll do. But honestly, I think it's a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. 
So that said, I mean, there's a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we're aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you'll see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you'll see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it's 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we're going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we'd be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just 5 years ago. So I'm excited about what the future possibilities hold."

Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that's probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it."

Maybe I'll start this, and then I'll kick it over to Brian potentially. You're a little bit muffled, but I think you're asking about what's the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next 5 years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. 
Similarly, that's all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren't as sophisticated. We'd like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it's largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it's possible there's some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn't say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come."

So it's -- that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there's a lot of folks. 
I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he was -- he saw that future too because in the past, I've been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we're ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid."

So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. 
Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We're helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charitable giving to support those in need, including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. 
We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we've increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I've requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. 
Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we're also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn't result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we'll move forward with it. 
We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. 
As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we're also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. 
These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We're excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. 
We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I'm extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. 
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. 
We're also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. 
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction, including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. 
Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don't anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. 
Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sagamore Wind farm. 
The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in a historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. 
In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in 8 years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. 
We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. 
As Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. 
Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
And with that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the 16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. 
Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We've reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. 
With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we'll now take questions."

But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It's really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. 
On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that.

But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado.

But as I said with the prior question, it's far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. 
So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 s like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there's going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I've always said, we'll move as fast as the speed of technology and that's what we'll do. But honestly, I think it's a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. 
So that said, I mean, there's a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we're aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you'll see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you'll see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it's 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we're going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we'd be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just 5 years ago. So I'm excited about what the future possibilities hold."

Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that's probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it."

Maybe I'll start this, and then I'll kick it over to Brian potentially. You're a little bit muffled, but I think you're asking about what's the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next 5 years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. 
Similarly, that's all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren't as sophisticated. We'd like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it's largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it's possible there's some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn't say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come."

So it's -- that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there's a lot of folks. 
I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he was -- he saw that future too because in the past, I've been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we're ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid."

But I want to start",859,"Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during winter storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few to come to mind. 
So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over a year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers. 
Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy. We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. 
In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increased renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs. 
In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado Pathway project later this year. 
Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning road map, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional road map highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade. 
Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community in a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution. We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Quality Index and a best place to work for LGBTQ equality destination for the fifth consecutive year. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
527542,709598254,2262591,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year.

We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increased margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. 
Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021. 
The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year. 
As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. 
Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings and carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with winter storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range. 
With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout, we filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And I think there's a recognition that that if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden infrastructure plan. If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low. And that's in all of our regions. The MISO studies are preliminary, but I think you can see that, that's an enormous investment opportunity. And hopefully, the slides we've attached for you are helpful in demonstrating where some of that build could happen."

Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start",857,"Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few that come to mind. 
So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over 1 year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers. 
Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy. 
We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increase renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs. 
In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado pathway project later this year. 
Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning roadmap, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional roadmap highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade. 
Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community, and a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution. 
We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality designation for the fifth consecutive year. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
527542,709598254,2262773,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben.

We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increase margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021. 
The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year. 
As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. 
Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings in carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range. 
With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout. We filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And I think there's a recognition that  if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan. 
If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt-out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low. And that's in all of our regions. The MISO studies are preliminary, but I think you can see that, that's an enormous investment opportunity. And hopefully, the slides we've attached for you are helpful in demonstrating where some of that build could happen."

So I would say, optimistic with what we're hearing down there. Overall, I think our territories, we're starting to come out of the COVID restrictions. And we have no restrictions in the Dakotas in Wisconsin and Texas, and Minnesota and Colorado are starting to ease up. In Minnesota here, we're at about a 75% capacity for bars and restaurants.

Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start",857,"Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few that come to mind. 
So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over 1 year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers. 
Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy. 
We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increase renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs. 
In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado pathway project later this year. 
Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning roadmap, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional roadmap highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade. 
Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community, and a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution. 
We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality designation for the fifth consecutive year. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
527542,709598254,2262778,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben.

We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increase margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M. 
Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021. 
The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year. 
As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. 
Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings in carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range. 
With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout. We filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And I think there's a recognition that  if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan. 
If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt-out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low.

So I would say, optimistic with what we're hearing down there. Overall, I think our territories, we're starting to come out of the COVID restrictions. And we have no restrictions in the Dakotas in Wisconsin and Texas, and Minnesota and Colorado are starting to ease up. In Minnesota here, we're at about a 75% capacity for bars and restaurants.

But to the extent that it becomes affordable, I mean, we will definitely have more batteries on our system."

So it's only going to be helpful, and EVs are great load for us, and they benefit all customers. And really, I think we're pioneering subscription rates and other things that encourage, not required, but encourage customers to charge off peak. And I think that minimizes the -- we'll have infrastructure needs, but that will minimize it again for the benefit of all customers, keeping prices low. And I just think the economics associated with the electrification of transport are pretty compelling. And this is only going to help accelerate that. So it's very positive."

Before we dive into quarterly results, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize Ben and thank him for his leadership. He's been a leader at Xcel Energy for two decades as Treasurer, CFO, President and Chief Operating Officer, and then CEO and Chairman of the Board. And since he assumed the CEO role in 2011, we've been a national leader in reliability, customer service and safety, all hallmarks of excellent utility operations, and our operational performance has improved over that period. 
For example, we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top-ranked fleets in the nation, while lowering our cost structure by 20%. And under Ben's leadership, we delivered for the environment, became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy. We've tripled our total wind capacity from 3,400 megawatts to over 10,000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4,000 megawatts. We've significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50% to 21%, and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% compared to our 2005 baseline. 
We were the first major U.S. utility to establish 100% carbon-free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability. We've delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well. We've tripled Xcel Energy's market cap from $12 billion to $37 billion, and our stock prices increased from $24 per share to almost $70 per share, reflecting a TSR of 300% and outpacing our peer group. We've met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth. And beyond Xcel Energy, Ben's recently served as Chairman of EEI, leading through pandemic uncertainties, driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations. 
He's had a tremendous run as CEO and will leave a lasting legacy at Xcel Energy, for the utility industry, and I would go so far as to say for the country. So thank you, Ben. And congratulations on your upcoming retirement in August. I look forward to your continued leadership at the Board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy. 
Looking ahead, and I'm honored with the opportunity to lead this great company, and I recognize the Lebron James-sized shoes that I'm filling. Since joining Xcel Energy 5 years ago, Ben and I have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy, and that will not change. We'll continue to lead the clean energy transition, enhance our customers' experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product. 
We've had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength, and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability. I'm excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade, driven by our generation resource plans, transmission expansion, distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision. As we move forward, innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80% carbon reduction by 2030 to 100% carbon-free electricity. I'll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid. 
I also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results. And safety is another area where I plan to help drive innovation. As one of our core values, safety is already a priority, but we can do even better. I want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change, eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust, transparency and learning. 
In the coming months, I look forward to continued engagement with our customers, our communities, our regulators, our investors and of course, our workforce. We have the best employees in the business, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited for the future successes that we'll achieve together. And to our investors, we appreciate the trust that you place in us, and we'll continue to be good stewards of your investments. 
Now turning to the quarter. Today, we reported solid quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share compared to $0.54 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance. We made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives, including 3 constructive rate case settlements that Brian will discuss in more detail. In addition, we've advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables. 
In Wisconsin, the commission approved our proposal for the 74-megawatt Mustang solar project for $100 million, which will be the largest solar facility in Western Wisconsin. In June, the Minnesota Commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA for $210 million from ALLETE. This repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource. And the Minnesota Commission continues to evaluate our $575 million proposal to build a 460-megawatt solar facility, takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal. 
We are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in Q1 of next year. Additionally, as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce, we proposed a training program in Minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy-related construction careers. 
Program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our Sherco solar proposal and other future projects. In June, we filed an alternative Minnesota resource plan, which achieves an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the Sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with 2 combustion turbines. 
The key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the King and the Sherco 3 coal units in 2028 and 2030, respectively; a life extension for our Monticello nuclear plant; construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units; and the addition of 3,150 megawatts of universal solar, 2,650 megawatts of wind, 800 megawatts of new hydrogen-ready CTs and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart CTs, 1,900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage. We've provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability. 
We expect a decision on the Minnesota resource plan later this year or early next. In addition, we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the Colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project. We expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022. And between Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins",667,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.19 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. 
As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs; increased O&M expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share; and lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. 
Turning to sales. Weather-normalized electric sales increased by 5.3% in the second quarter. This reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels, and our sales were most suppressed due to COVID impacts. Our year-to-date weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 1.6%. We continue to anticipate modest annual weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. 
Shifting to expenses. O&M increased $50 million for the quarter, which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the 2 periods. Last year, we had significant O&M reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from COVID, while the fourth quarter was at higher levels. So the quarterly O&M comparisons will be chunky this year. 
Turning to regulatory filings. We reached constructive settlements in 3 rate cases. In Wisconsin, we agreed to a rate increase of $66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an ROE of 9.8% in 2022, 10.0% in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In New Mexico, we agreed to a rate increase of $62 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. We also accelerated the depreciation life of our Tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement. In North Dakota, we agreed to a rate increase of $7 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. 
We anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year. In July, we filed a Colorado electric rate case, seeking a net rate increase of $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and the 2022 forecast test year. The rate case is largely driven by capital investment, and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022. We also have a pending Texas electric rate case. We're seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. 
The request is driven by capital investment and is based on an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. Commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to March 2021. As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a Minnesota natural gas case later this year. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We received commission approval for the Mustang solar project and the ALLETE wind PPA repowering buyout. 
We provided an alternative to our Minnesota resource plan, which will deliver 85% carbon reduction by 2030, provide transparency into our long-term opportunities. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota. We filed our Colorado electric rate case. We reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in our 5% to 7% objective range. Now before we open up for questions, I'll turn it over to Ben for some closing comments."

On transmission, in particular, in Colorado, we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan, Julien. Historically, we'd have generation be put forward first and then you'd follow-up with the transmission that's necessary. I think where we are and certainly in Colorado and where I think a lot of the country is actually is, is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition. 
So in Colorado, we've put forth what we call the power pathway. That's largely, I'll call it, a super highway of transmission lines through the Eastern Plains of Colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the Eastern half of Colorado with the load centers, predominantly in Denver and in the I-25 corridor. So that path, along with the Colorado resource plan, are progressing in parallel, 2 separate dockets but in parallel. We expect resolution on both of them by late this year, probably early next year. 
And your comment on -- we've got a base plan, and I call that sort of we're going to build the freeway. But we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that. So while the base plan for the freeway itself, I think, is about -- and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere in the $1.7-ish billion range. But we need to build voltage and VAR stability. We need to build -- once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist, then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system. 
And that's sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we'll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are. So like I just mentioned to Jeremy, we'll conclude the phase 1 of the resource plan in Q1 of next year. At that point, we'll go into resource acquisition. And that's where we picked the resource in exact locations, and then we can have a better, more granular answer to your question on what's the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system. Does that make sense?"

If you're just looking at the headlines, right, we're not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing. For us, it's inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel, copper and labor. But really, we think it's transitory in nature. 
And I think really, it's -- I think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy, and it's a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy, something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective. So I don't see any significant impacts as we sit here today. Now specifically, if I want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight. Now the 4 wind repowerings that we have, we feel really good about those in Minnesota. 
Now those are partial repowerings, so I think blades in the inside of the nacelles. We're not replacing the steel towers. We're not facing steel price risk there. And so we don't really face any significant inflationary pressures on those. So feel good about that. The large-scale solar farm that we have in front of the Minnesota commission, I'm sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year. But we look at that. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year. So we feel really good about that project, too. So overall, something we're certainly focused on and watching but don't see any real impacts as we sit here today."

Let me just -- I'll talk a little bit about the clean heat plan in Colorado and maybe even to a parallel path, the innovative gas act that was also approved here in Minnesota. Look, I think both of those bills recognize that we're in early innings of lowering our customers' emissions from the gas LDC businesses and not dissimilar to what we went through in the mid-90s with renewables. 
I mean, the technology is nascent and the solutions are relatively expensive. But we also recognize we need to start somewhere. And so I think that the legislation in both places recognize those facts. And look, we are -- we'll do pilots. We'll introduce technology. We'll look at beneficial electrification and energy efficiency programs, all tools that maybe aren't readily available under the current regulation schemes today. But these pieces of legislation allow for some of that innovation to happen on the gas LDC side. 
I think the legislation also recognizes it's really important to respect the reliability and affordability. And I think each state addressed it slightly differently. But there's a cap in Colorado and regulatory approval for plans. And in Minnesota, similarly, their regulatory approval for the pilots, that makes sure that they're cost-justified and beneficial for our customers as well as we think about lowering their emissions profile from the gas LDC business. 
So we're -- we were very active in both of those pieces of legislation, and we are working with the regulatory agencies to look at how we write the regulations for those pieces of legislation. And then we'll be active as we put proposals forward to help our customers reduce their footprint emissions profile in each state. So yes, I think there's opportunity here, and we're going to continue to work with our commissions and our stakeholders."

Before we dive into quarterly results, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize Ben and thank him for his leadership. He's been a leader at Xcel Energy for two decades as Treasurer, CFO, President and Chief Operating Officer, and then CEO and Chairman of the Board. And since he assumed the CEO role in 2011, we've been a national leader in reliability, customer service and safety, all hallmarks of excellent utility operations, and our operational performance has improved over that period. 
For example, we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top-ranked fleets in the nation, while lowering our cost structure by 20%. And under Ben's leadership, we delivered for the environment, became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy. We've tripled our total wind capacity from 3,400 megawatts to over 10,000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4,000 megawatts. We've significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50% to 21%, and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% compared to our 2005 baseline. 
We were the first major U.S. utility to establish 100% carbon-free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability. We've delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well. We've tripled Xcel Energy's market cap from $12 billion to $37 billion, and our stock prices increased from $24 per share to almost $70 per share, reflecting a TSR of 300% and outpacing our peer group. We've met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth. And beyond Xcel Energy, Ben's recently served as Chairman of EEI, leading through pandemic uncertainties, driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations. 
He's had a tremendous run as CEO and will leave a lasting legacy at Xcel Energy, for the utility industry, and I would go so far as to say for the country. So thank you, Ben. And congratulations on your upcoming retirement in August. I look forward to your continued leadership at the Board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy. 
Looking ahead, and I'm honored with the opportunity to lead this great company, and I recognize the Lebron James-sized shoes that I'm filling. Since joining Xcel Energy 5 years ago, Ben and I have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy, and that will not change. We'll continue to lead the clean energy transition, enhance our customers' experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product. 
We've had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength, and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability. I'm excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade, driven by our generation resource plans, transmission expansion, distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision. As we move forward, innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80% carbon reduction by 2030 to 100% carbon-free electricity. I'll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid. 
I also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results. And safety is another area where I plan to help drive innovation. As one of our core values, safety is already a priority, but we can do even better. I want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change, eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust, transparency and learning. 
In the coming months, I look forward to continued engagement with our customers, our communities, our regulators, our investors and of course, our workforce. We have the best employees in the business, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited for the future successes that we'll achieve together. And to our investors, we appreciate the trust that you place in us, and we'll continue to be good stewards of your investments. 
Now turning to the quarter. Today, we reported solid quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share compared to $0.54 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance. We made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives, including 3 constructive rate case settlements that Brian will discuss in more detail. In addition, we've advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables. 
In Wisconsin, the commission approved our proposal for the 74-megawatt Mustang solar project for $100 million, which will be the largest solar facility in Western Wisconsin. In June, the Minnesota Commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA for $210 million from ALLETE. This repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource. And the Minnesota Commission continues to evaluate our $575 million proposal to build a 460-megawatt solar facility, takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal. 
We are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in Q1 of next year. Additionally, as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce, we proposed a training program in Minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy-related construction careers. 
Program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our Sherco solar proposal and other future projects. In June, we filed an alternative Minnesota resource plan, which achieves an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the Sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with 2 combustion turbines. 
The key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the King and the Sherco 3 coal units in 2028 and 2030, respectively; a life extension for our Monticello nuclear plant; construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units; and the addition of 3,150 megawatts of universal solar, 2,650 megawatts of wind, 800 megawatts of new hydrogen-ready CTs and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart CTs, 1,900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage. We've provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability. 
We expect a decision on the Minnesota resource plan later this year or early next. In addition, we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the Colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project. We expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022. And between Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins",667,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.19 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. 
As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs; increased O&M expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share; and lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. 
Turning to sales. Weather-normalized electric sales increased by 5.3% in the second quarter. This reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels, and our sales were most suppressed due to COVID impacts. Our year-to-date weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 1.6%. We continue to anticipate modest annual weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. 
Shifting to expenses. O&M increased $50 million for the quarter, which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the 2 periods. Last year, we had significant O&M reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from COVID, while the fourth quarter was at higher levels. So the quarterly O&M comparisons will be chunky this year. 
Turning to regulatory filings. We reached constructive settlements in 3 rate cases. In Wisconsin, we agreed to a rate increase of $66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an ROE of 9.8% in 2022, 10.0% in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In New Mexico, we agreed to a rate increase of $62 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. We also accelerated the depreciation life of our Tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement. In North Dakota, we agreed to a rate increase of $7 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. 
We anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year. In July, we filed a Colorado electric rate case, seeking a net rate increase of $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and the 2022 forecast test year. The rate case is largely driven by capital investment, and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022. We also have a pending Texas electric rate case. We're seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. 
The request is driven by capital investment and is based on an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. Commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to March 2021. As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a Minnesota natural gas case later this year. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We received commission approval for the Mustang solar project and the ALLETE wind PPA repowering buyout. 
We provided an alternative to our Minnesota resource plan, which will deliver 85% carbon reduction by 2030, provide transparency into our long-term opportunities. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota. We filed our Colorado electric rate case. We reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in our 5% to 7% objective range. Now before we open up for questions, I'll turn it over to Ben for some closing comments."

On transmission, in particular, in Colorado, we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan, Julien. Historically, we'd have generation be put forward first and then you'd follow-up with the transmission that's necessary. I think where we are and certainly in Colorado and where I think a lot of the country is actually is, is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition. 
So in Colorado, we've put forth what we call the power pathway. That's largely, I'll call it, a super highway of transmission lines through the Eastern Plains of Colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the Eastern half of Colorado with the load centers, predominantly in Denver and in the I-25 corridor. So that path, along with the Colorado resource plan, are progressing in parallel, 2 separate dockets but in parallel. We expect resolution on both of them by late this year, probably early next year. 
And your comment on -- we've got a base plan, and I call that sort of we're going to build the freeway. But we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that. So while the base plan for the freeway itself, I think, is about -- and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere in the $1.7-ish billion range. But we need to build voltage and VAR stability. We need to build -- once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist, then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system. 
And that's sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we'll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are. So like I just mentioned to Jeremy, we'll conclude the phase 1 of the resource plan in Q1 of next year. At that point, we'll go into resource acquisition. And that's where we picked the resource in exact locations, and then we can have a better, more granular answer to your question on what's the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system. Does that make sense?"

If you're just looking at the headlines, right, we're not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing. For us, it's inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel, copper and labor. But really, we think it's transitory in nature. 
And I think really, it's -- I think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy, and it's a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy, something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective. So I don't see any significant impacts as we sit here today. Now specifically, if I want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight. Now the 4 wind repowerings that we have, we feel really good about those in Minnesota. 
Now those are partial repowerings, so I think blades in the inside of the nacelles. We're not replacing the steel towers. We're not facing steel price risk there. And so we don't really face any significant inflationary pressures on those. So feel good about that. The large-scale solar farm that we have in front of the Minnesota commission, I'm sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year. But we look at that. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year. So we feel really good about that project, too.

Let me just -- I'll talk a little bit about the clean heat plan in Colorado and maybe even to a parallel path, the innovative gas act that was also approved here in Minnesota. Look, I think both of those bills recognize that we're in early innings of lowering our customers' emissions from the gas LDC businesses and not dissimilar to what we went through in the mid-90s with renewables. 
I mean, the technology is nascent and the solutions are relatively expensive. But we also recognize we need to start somewhere. And so I think that the legislation in both places recognize those facts. And look, we are -- we'll do pilots. We'll introduce technology. We'll look at beneficial electrification and energy efficiency programs, all tools that maybe aren't readily available under the current regulation schemes today. But these pieces of legislation allow for some of that innovation to happen on the gas LDC side. 
I think the legislation also recognizes it's really important to respect the reliability and affordability. And I think each state addressed it slightly differently. But there's a cap in Colorado and regulatory approval for plans. And in Minnesota, similarly, their regulatory approval for the pilots, that makes sure that they're cost-justified and beneficial for our customers as well as we think about lowering their emissions profile from the gas LDC business. 
So we're -- we were very active in both of those pieces of legislation, and we are working with the regulatory agencies to look at how we write the regulations for those pieces of legislation.

Stuff that's not included in the near-term is obviously MISO and SPP transmission expansion plans, and those are generally outside of our 5-year forecast but definitely in sort of a 10-year vision forecast. And then we expect our base -- rate base growth plan to be right around 7%. And so any incremental -- and I think there's a couple of incremental projects that could take us above that. I think we'd expect to keep our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate, and we can reevaluate that regularly, and we do.

Today, we reported solid third quarter earnings of $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. And given our strong year-to-date results, we're narrowing our 2021 guidance to $2.94 to $2.98 per share.",957,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. Today, we reported solid third quarter earnings of $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. And given our strong year-to-date results, we're narrowing our 2021 guidance to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We're also initiating 2022 guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. 
Consistent with our past tradition, we've updated our base investment plan, reflecting $26 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years, which provides significant benefits to our customers and supports community vitality. This investment plan delivers rate base growth of 6.5% off of a projected 2021 year-end rate base. 
This plan is robust, but there are certain investment opportunities that are not included in our base plan, including potential renewable generation assets authorized in our Minnesota or Colorado resource plan proceedings and additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation additions in Colorado beyond the base Colorado power pathway proposal. The base plan also does not include any capital for green hydrogen production for our LDC or generation needs, which we believe could be material over the balance of the decade. 
We have our hydrogen pilot at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, and we're exploring 5 to 8 additional greenfield and brownfield projects. And with favorable state backdrops in Minnesota and in Colorado, which have passed clean fuel legislation as well as a potential for a federal hydrogen production tax credit, we believe that our favorable renewable generation conditions will help us push beyond pilots and into green hydrogen production resources that can be valuable to a clean energy future. 
I'm very excited about our investment plan, which supports continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It provides for sustainability of our local communities, enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our fleet transition, keeps customer bills low and delivers attractive returns for our investors. 
We're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans and the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources. Together, our resource plans are going to add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030, while keeping customer bills at or below the rate of inflation. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans in the first quarter of next year. 
The clean energy transition is also going to need substantial transmission investment. We continue to make good progress in the Colorado power pathway transmission project, which is essential for us to deliver on our Colorado energy resource plan. It will enable over 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state, and it's vital as we explore further western market integration over time. To date, comments from most parties have been generally supportive, and we expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2022. 
In the Midwest, MISO has experienced some minor delays, but we still expect MTEP 21 to be announced in the first half of next year. 
We also had a strong operational quarter. Our industry-leading nuclear fleet set another record, with 2 units having run over 700 consecutive days prior to their refueling outages. Another highlight this quarter was the dedication of the 300-megawatt Bighorn solar facility at the EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado. In partnership with Lightsource BP and state and local leaders, we've enabled the largest on-site solar array in the country serving a single customer. This is a really creative solution between multiple parties to ensure the continued operation and expansion of the steel mill and its 1,100 employees. It reduces carbon emissions and creates valuable property tax base that helps sustain the local economy. 
We also continue to partner with our states and OEMs to electrify the transportation sector. This quarter, we implemented new programs for our Colorado customers that will help us to achieve our goal of enabling 1.5 million electric vehicles across our states by 2030. We appreciate the collaboration with so many stakeholders as we collectively work to reduce carbon emissions and enable sustainable communities. 
We remain well positioned with a sound strategy, a robust 5-year capital plan, and sustainable long-term growth trajectory that provides attractive returns to our investors, while keeping bills low for our customers. These plans are not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, it's our understanding the Biden administration has reached an agreement on a framework for the reconciliation package, which would include extensions for investment tax credits and production tax credits, solar and a hydrogen production tax credit, a storage and a transmission investment tax credit and direct pay options for all tax credits. This proposed plan creates significant customer benefits by lowering the cost of our proposed resource plans and potentially accelerating our clean energy transition. 
Our steel for fuel program has demonstrated our geographic advantages in renewables. Proposed tax credit expenses for ITCs and PTCs, including the solar production tax credit, will make future projects even more competitive, providing additional benefit to our customers. Additionally, a direct pay option would provide greater financial flexibility to increased corporate cash flow and credit metrics, which would reduce our financing needs. 
A PTC for green hydrogen would also bring significant value and technology advancement and costs. It could help accelerate the time frame in which we could begin incorporating hydrogen into power generation and into our natural gas distribution operations at a cost that's more economic for our customers. While discussions continue at the federal level on the final bill, we are optimistic that this plan will be passed and will have significant benefits to our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year. The most significant earnings drivers",1218,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year. 
The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: Higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.04 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And in addition, the lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.01 per share, 
As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.03 per share.
Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.4% in the third quarter, while our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.9% Given our year-to-date results and the continued economic rebound in our states, we're updating our full year weather-adjusted electric sales growth to approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses declined 1.9% for the quarter and increased 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. Quarterly O&M expense comparisons are noisy with the COVID impacts from last year, but overall we expect our O&M expenses to increase approximately 1% for the year.
Turning to regulatory. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado, and we're making strong progress on a potential Texas rate case settlement. As a reminder, last quarter we reached constructive settlements in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota rate cases. In October, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the Colorado staff in the Colorado Energy office that proposes to resolve several regulatory proceedings. Key terms include: 
We will fully recover all winter storm deferred fuel costs over 24 months for electric and over 30 months from the natural gas LDC customers, with no carrying charges through a rider. Please note, the winter storm cost estimate for Colorado was revised to $550 million. 
We will refund to electric customers approximately $41 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the 2020 decoupling program. [ goal] recovery of approximately $14 million of replacement power costs incurred due to an extended [ COMAC 3] outage during 2020. And we will not seek recovery of approximately $11 million of deferred COVID-19 bad debt expense. 
We are pleased that we were able to reach this comprehensive settlement, which represents compromises from all the parties and take steps to mitigate the customer impact of the [cost] recovery. We expect a commission decision in the first half of 2022. 
In terms of pending rate cases, we are making progress in settlement discussions in our Texas case. As a result, the hearing schedule has been abated, and we are hopeful that we'll ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement. 
We expect a decision on our Colorado electric case in March of next year with new rates effective in April. As a reminder, we're seeking a net rate increase of approximately $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 55.6% in the 2022 forecast test year. The case is largely driven by capital investment. 
In October, we filed the Minnesota electric rate case seeking a net increase of $677 million over 3 years. The filing is based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and equity ratio of 52.5% in forecast test years. We requested interim rates of $288 million to be implemented in January 2022.
Finally, we plan to file a Minnesota gas rate case in early November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a stay-out option as we look to help mitigate bill impacts of cost recovery for our customers. 
As Bob mentioned, we have issued a robust $26 billion 5-year capital forecast, which is detailed in our earnings release. Our base capital plan results in rate base growth of approximately 6.5% using 2021 as a base. The base forecast reflects significant growth investment in our Colorado power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our proposed [ circle] solar facility. It also includes 2 natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience. 
Beyond our base capital forecast, we anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 2,000 megawatts a of renewable additions from 2024 to 2026, which would result in incremental capital investment of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in the latter part of this 5-year forecast. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. We expect to issue $800 million of equity and $450 million of DRIP and benefits equity over the next 5 years. The financing plan maintains our current credit metrics and strong balance sheet, which is important for maintaining a low cost of capital for our customers. We expect the equity would likely be issued through an ATM over the 5 years. 
We anticipate that any incremental capital will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. However, our equity needs could be significantly reduced if the reconciliation package is passed with the current framework. 
Shifting to earnings. We are initiating our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.
In addition, we've updated the base of our growth rate to $2.96 per share, which represents the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance range. This represents 6.5% growth in the base between 2020 and 2021.
With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado that resolved several regulatory proceedings. We are making progress towards the settlement of our Texas rate case. We narrowed our 2021 guidance range to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2022 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping bills low for our customers.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And we expected to give back some of the, call it, the residential gains that we saw last year, but it's been sticky. If you look at a year-to-date basis, residential is up at 1.8%. So I think that's -- that was one of the big drivers of our updated guidance for the year. And a lot of that is in Colorado, if you look at where Colorado has been. 
We also see strong customer growth on the residential side across all of our service territories. Residential permits or building permits are significantly up.
On the C&I side, I think it's -- we're really seeing good rebound in across all C&I sectors in our opcos. But really, the Permian Basin is coming back. We focus a lot on what's happening with our oil and gas customers in SPS. And we look at some substations that directly serve those loads, and that load is up 25% even relative to pre-pandemic levels. 
And so we're hearing our -- those customers are disciplined, but continue to drill. And also, they're looking at electrification. They're feeling ESG pressure and that is a big focus on electrifying [rail], rigs, pumps, compressors, certainly good load growth for us. So I think we're pleasantly surprised with the strength of our sales and confident that it will continue into next year."

Our philosophy has been long runways, Insoo, making sure that we take care of the communities, the property tax base. We get a chance to do economic development and bring businesses back to those communities that supported us in those assets for decades.
So with the proposal on the table for production tax credits that are part of the reconciliation bill, I think you're going to see with a 10-year window, we've got a long runway to manage this transition. And I think for the company, we are going to potentially accelerate areas that might have been a bit behind, as best we can. But these resource plans are very much in the works. 
And so we expect to work through these resource plans, and we file about every 3 years. So come '24, so we'd have another bite at the apple to think about the remaining assets on our fleet in those transitions. 
I think at the core, though, we need to identify that next generation of generation. We were the first company to announce we'd be carbon-free by 2050. I think what we need is another type of emissions-free generation. 
And I think the infrastructure bill triples DOE funding for research and development. I think that's critical for the industry to progress past where we expect to be, which is about an 80%, 85% carbon reduction by the end of the decade."

One of the key tenets of our strategy is affordability for our customers. You hear how resource planning will drive over the long term, continued transitions in renewables that will drive customer bills relatively lower. We always work for ways to mitigate the customer impacts. 
These cases are largely capital cases under approved capital investment plans. And we have deferred, at least the Minnesota side, for over 6 years we haven't had a case. And we've offered ways to mitigate some of the impacts of this case in particular. If you remember, we deferred cases throughout the pandemic and feel like we've been very judicious in watching our O&M expenses and trying to continue the investment plans that drive the clean energy transition, but ultimately end up in investing in capital that will ultimately need to get recovered. 
So our plans, we've offered mitigation on interim rates. We think that the bill increases are manageable. I think under the proposal, we'd be down at about $1.25 a month for residential customers, so I think very manageable in total bill impact. 
And so other areas we improve, we work hard on, if you think about our steel for fuel program and the success of adding wind in the Upper Midwest that we talked about this at the outset, but that addition of those megawatts has provided a natural gas hedge. We think we saved our customers over $300 million per year by having wind blowing instead of procuring natural gas on the margin. So a very successful steel for fuel program, which doesn't necessarily show up, but it's mitigated bills over the last year's and certainly with this uptick in natural gas pricing."

And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers",309,"Yes. So really, Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers on a year-to-date basis this year. So that's really what Bob's point is. 
I think the broader question is around kind of how these higher commodity costs potentially impact our customers. And when we think about on the electric side, I think we're really well positioned, right? Bob already made the point about our wind strategy, our steel for fuel strategy. We also look, right, natural gas is a relatively small portion of the overall customer bills on the electric side. And we also have length. And you look at in NSP and SPS, this is something that doesn't quite come through clearly, but we've had like this year and we can sell into the market. And we've provided over $300 million in market sales that we credit back to our customers and help offset some of those higher commodity costs. So I think we're really well positioned on the electric side and don't see a significant impact on our customers.
On the LDC side, certainly, there's less you can do there, given that commodity costs are a higher portion of our customers' bill. But the -- on the -- going into the winter, right, we have physical storage. We have financial products. And so I think we're when we look at it for -- take Colorado for example, I think our forecast for an impact, the average impact on the residential customer bill is about $15 per month for this winter. So we think it's manageable, but we obviously look for every opportunity we can to help mitigate these customer bill impacts."

So I think that -- I don't think that's unique to us. I think that's pretty common across other utilities. That's one of the big levers that they look at in determining what the appropriate ROE is. 
Now we feel pretty good that from where we stand, our ROEs that have been authorized over the past few years have been below the national average. So when we think about ROE risk there, we think of more potential upside and getting closer to the national average, right, as we know we're leading the clean energy transition, helping our states lead with their policy goals. So I think there's an opportunity there for us on the ROE side. 
So for us, I think we're pretty proud about our O&M story. Now if you go all the way back to 2014 and look at where we are today, we're basically flat from an O&M perspective. So we saved, if you just apply the 2% inflation growth in that number, maybe several hundred millions of dollars that we've avoided and saved our customers annually. 
So I think overall, I think we have a really clean story. Our cases are primarily capital driven, investing in the needs of the system. So I think overall -- obviously you have sometimes just lumpy if you hadn't filed a case in 6 years, and it comes a big headline number. But we look forward to working with our parties and the commissions on working through these rate cases and really delivering a great product in hand."

Consistent with our past tradition, we've updated our base investment plan, reflecting $26 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years, which provides significant benefits to our customers and supports community vitality. This investment plan delivers rate base growth of 6.5% off of a projected 2021 year-end rate base. 
This plan is robust, but there are certain investment opportunities that are not included in our base plan, including potential renewable generation assets authorized in our Minnesota or Colorado resource plan proceedings and additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation additions in Colorado beyond the base Colorado power pathway proposal. The base plan also does not include any capital for green hydrogen production for our LDC or generation needs, which we believe could be material over the balance of the decade.
We have our hydrogen pilot at the Prairie Island Nuclear Plant, and we're exploring 5 to 8 additional greenfield and brownfield projects. And with favorable state backdrops in Minnesota and in Colorado, which have passed clean fuel legislation as well as a potential for a federal hydrogen production tax credit, we believe that our favorable renewable generation conditions will help us push beyond pilots and into green hydrogen production resources that can be valuable to a clean energy future. 
I'm very excited about our investment plan, which supports continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It provides for sustainability of our local communities, enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our fleet transition, keeps customer bills low and delivers attractive returns for our investors. 
We're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans and the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources. Together, our resource plans are going to add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030, while keeping customer bills at or below the rate of inflation. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans in the first quarter of next year. 
The clean energy transition is also going to need substantial transmission investment. We continue to make good progress in the Colorado power pathway transmission project, which is essential for us to deliver on our Colorado energy resource plan. It will enable over 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state, and it's vital as we explore further western market integration over time. To date, comments from most parties have been generally supportive, and we expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2022. In the Midwest, MISO has experienced some minor delays, but we still expect MTEP21 to be announced in the first half of next year. 
We also had a strong operational quarter. Our industry-leading nuclear fleet set another record, with 2 units having run over 700 consecutive days prior to their refueling outages. Another highlight this quarter was the dedication of the 300-megawatt Bighorn solar facility at the EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado. In partnership with Lightsource bp and state and local leaders, we've enabled the largest on-site solar array in the country serving a single customer. This is a really creative solution between multiple parties to ensure the continued operation and expansion of the steel mill and its 1,100 employees. It reduces carbon emissions and creates valuable property tax base that helps sustain the local economy. 
We also continue to partner with our states and OEMs to electrify the transportation sector. This quarter, we implemented new programs for our Colorado customers that will help us to achieve our goal of enabling 1.5 million electric vehicles across our states by 2030. We appreciate the collaboration with so many stakeholders as we collectively work to reduce carbon emissions and enable sustainable communities. 
We remain well positioned with a sound strategy, a robust 5-year capital plan, and sustainable long-term growth trajectory that provides attractive returns to our investors, while keeping bills low for our customers. These plans are not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, it's our understanding that Biden administration has reached an agreement on a framework for the reconciliation package, which would include extensions for investment tax credits and production tax credits, a solar and a hydrogen production tax credit, a storage and a transmission investment tax credit and direct pay options for all tax credits. This proposed plan creates significant customer benefits by lowering the cost of our proposed resource plans and potentially accelerating our clean energy transition. 
Our steel for fuel program has demonstrated our geographic advantages in renewables. Proposed tax credit expenses for ITCs and PTCs, including the solar production tax credit, will make future projects even more competitive, providing additional benefit to our customers. Additionally, a direct pay option would provide greater financial flexibility, increased corporate cash flow and credit metrics, which would reduce our financing needs. 
A PTC for green hydrogen would also bring significant value and technology advancement and costs. It could help accelerate the time frame in which we could begin incorporating hydrogen into power generation and into our natural gas distribution operations at a cost that's more economic for our customers. While discussions continue at the federal level on the final bill, we are optimistic that this plan will be passed and will have significant benefits to our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year.The most significant earnings drivers",1217,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year.
The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: Higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.04 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And in addition, the lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.01 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.4% in the third quarter, while our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.9%. Given our year-to-date results and the continued economic rebound in our states, we're updating our full year weather-adjusted electric sales growth to approximately 1.5% to 2%.
Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses declined 1.9% for the quarter and increased 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. Quarterly O&M expense comparisons are noisy with the COVID impacts from last year, but overall, we expect our O&M expenses to increase approximately 1% for the year.
Turning to regulatory. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado, and are making strong progress on potential Texas rate case settlement. As a reminder, last quarter we reached constructive settlements in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota rate cases. In October, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the Colorado staff in the Colorado Energy office that proposes to resolve several regulatory proceedings. Key terms include: we will fully recover all Winter Storm Uri deferred fuel costs over 24 months for electric and over 30 months from the natural gas LDC customers, with no carrying charges through a rider. Please note, the Uri Storm cost estimate for Colorado was revised to $550 million.
We will refund to electric customers approximately $41 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the 2020 decoupling program. We'll forgo recovery of approximately $14 million of replacement power costs incurred due to an extended Comanche 3 outage during 2020. And we will not seek recovery of approximately $11 million of deferred COVID-19 bad debt expense.
We are pleased that we were able to reach this comprehensive settlement, which represents compromises from all the parties and take steps to mitigate the customer impact of the Uri cost recovery. We expect a commission decision in the first half of 2022. 
In terms of pending rate cases, we are making progress in settlement discussions in our Texas case. As a result, the hearing schedule has been abated, and we are hopeful that we'll ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement.
We expect a decision on our Colorado electric case in March of next year with new rates effective in April. As a reminder, we're seeking a net rate increase of approximately $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 55.6% in the 2022 forecast test year. The case is largely driven by capital investment. 
In October, we filed the Minnesota electric rate case seeking a net increase of $677 million over 3 years. The filing is based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and equity ratio of 52.5% in forecast test years. We requested interim rates of $288 million to be implemented in January 2022. 
Finally, we plan to file a Minnesota gas rate case in early November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a stay-out option as we look to help mitigate bill impacts of Uri cost recovery for our customers. 
As Bob mentioned, we have issued a robust $26 billion 5-year capital forecast, which is detailed in our earnings release. Our base capital plan results in rate base growth of approximately 6.5% using 2021 as a base. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment in our Colorado power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our proposed Sherco solar facility. It also includes 2 natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience. 
Beyond our base capital forecast, we anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewable additions from 2024 to 2026, which would result in incremental capital investment of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in the latter part of this 5-year forecast.
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. We expect to issue $800 million of equity and $450 million of DRIP and benefits equity over the next 5 years. The financing plan maintains our current credit metrics and strong balance sheet, which is important for maintaining a low cost of capital for our customers. We expect the equity would likely be issued through an ATM over the 5 years.
We anticipate that any incremental capital would be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. However, our equity needs could be significantly reduced if the reconciliation package is passed with the current framework. 
Shifting to earnings. We are initiating our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. 
In addition, we've updated the base of our growth rate to $2.96 per share, which represents the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance range. This represents 6.5% growth in the base between 2020 and 2021. 
With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado that resolved several regulatory proceedings. We are making progress towards the settlement of our Texas rate case. We narrowed our 2021 guidance range to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2022 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping bills low for our customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

So I think that's -- that was one of the big drivers of our updated guidance for the year. And a lot of that is in Colorado, if you look at where Colorado has been. We also see strong customer growth on the residential side across all of our service territories. Residential permits or building permits are significantly up. 
On the C&I side, I think it's -- we're really seeing good rebound in -- across all C&I sectors in our opcos. But really, the Permian Basin is coming back. We focus a lot on what's happening with our oil and gas customers in SPS. And we look at some substations that directly serve those loads, and that load is up 25% even relative to prepandemic levels. And so we're hearing our -- those customers are disciplined, but continue to drill. And also, they're looking at electrification. They're feeling ESG pressure and that is a big focus on electrifying drill rigs, pumps, compressors, certainly good load growth for us.

We get a chance to do economic development and bring businesses back to those communities that have supported us and those assets for decades.
So with the proposal on the table for production tax credits that are part of the reconciliation bill, I think you're going to see with a 10-year window, we've got a long runway to manage this transition. And I think for the company, we are going to potentially accelerate areas that might have been a bit behind, as best we can. But these resource plans are very much in the works. And so we expect to work through these resource plans, and we file about every 3 years. So come '24, so we'd have another bite at the apple to think about the remaining assets on our fleet in those transitions. 
I think at the core, though, we need to identify that next generation of generation. We were the first company to announce we'd be carbon-free by 2050. I think what we need is another type of emissions-free generation. And I think the infrastructure bill triples DOE funding for research and development.

So opportunities are out there. We really honestly, without a lot of clarity on the bills, lack some definition, but that's the stuff we're going to be working on through the course of the next couple of months, and then we'll have more clarity as we get more insight into the bill text."

One of the key tenets of our strategy is affordability for our customers. You hear how resource planning will drive over the long term, continued transitions in renewables that will drive customer bills relatively lower. We always work for ways to mitigate the customer impacts.
These cases are largely capital cases under approved capital investment plans. And we have deferred -- at least in the Minnesota side, for over 6 years, we haven't had a case. And we've offered ways to mitigate some of the impacts of this case in particular. If you remember, we deferred cases throughout the pandemic and feel like we've been very judicious in watching our O&M expenses and trying to continue the investment plans that drive a clean energy transition, but ultimately end up in investing in capital that will ultimately need to get recovered. 
So our plans, we've offered mitigation on interim rates. We think that the bill increases are manageable. I think under the proposal, we'd be down at about $1.25 a month for residential customers, so I think very manageable in total bill impacts. 
And so other areas we improve, we work hard on, if you think about our steel for fuel program and the success of adding wind in the Upper Midwest that -- we talked about this at the outset, but that addition of those megawatts has provided a natural gas hedge. We think we saved our customers over $300 million per year by having wind blowing instead of procuring natural gas on the margin. So a very successful steel for fuel program, which doesn't necessarily show up, but it's mitigated bills over the last years and certainly with this uptick in natural gas pricing."

So really -- Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our custome",312,"Yes. So really -- Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers on a year-to-date basis this year. So that's really what Bob's point is. 
I think the broader question is around kind of how these higher commodity costs potentially impact our customers. And when we think about it on the electric side. I think we're really well positioned, right? Bob already made the point about our wind strategy, our steel for fuel strategy. But also look, right, natural gas is a relatively small portion of the overall customer bills on the electric side. And we also have length. And you look at in NSP and SPS, this is something that doesn't quite come through clearly, but we've had light this year and we can sell into the market. And we've provided over $300 million in market sales that we credit back to our customers and help offset some of those higher commodity costs. So I think we're really well positioned on the electric side and don't see a significant impact on our customers.
On the LDC side, certainly, there's less you can do there, given that commodity costs are a higher portion of our customers' bill. But the -- on the -- going into the winter, right, we have physical storage. We have financial products. And so I think we're -- when we look at it for -- take Colorado for example, I think our forecast for an impact, the average impact on the residential customer bill is about $15 per month for this winter. So we think it's manageable, but we obviously look for every opportunity we can to help mitigate these customer bill impacts."

So I think that -- I don't think that's unique to us. I think that's pretty common across other utilities. That's one of the big levers that they look at in determining what the appropriate ROE is.
Now we feel pretty good that from where we stand, our ROEs that have been authorized over the past few years have been below the national average. So when we think about ROE risk there, we think of more potential upside and getting closer to the national average, right, as we know we're leading the clean energy transition, helping our states lead with their policy goals. So I think there's an opportunity there for us on the ROE side. 
Now for us, I think we're pretty proud about our O&M story. Now if you go all the way back to 2014 and look at where we are today, we're basically flat from an O&M perspective. So we saved, if you just apply the 2% inflation growth in that number, maybe several hundred millions of dollars that we've avoided and saved our customers annually.
