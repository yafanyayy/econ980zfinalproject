I hope you are all staying healthy and well. Our community and business had a strong end of the year. As COVID continued to keep many of us apart and at home, people and businesses continue relying on our services to stay in touch and create economic opportunities. 2.6 billion people now use one or more of our apps each day, and more than 200 million businesses, mostly small businesses, use our free tools to reach customers. Those numbers give a sense of scale but some of the stories we hear show the impact.
Groups have formed where COVID long haulers are helping each other through this scary experience where there's not much else to turn to. Teachers are sending class assignments to students through WhatsApp. Local bookstores and coffee shops, they're using Instagram to let customers know they're open for curbside pickup. We saw people come together to raise $1.8 billion for nonprofits and personal causes through our fundraising tools last year, including $175 million for COVID-related causes alone. I'm proud of the role that our services played in helping people support each other during what has been such a hard time.
Now I've spent a fair amount of time on recent earnings calls, talking about our election integrity efforts, so I'm not going to discuss them at length today. But I do want to call out that according to our estimates, we easily surpassed our goal to help 4 million people register to vote as part of the largest-ever effort -- largest effort to distribute authoritative voting information in recent history. And I want to thank everyone involved in our teams and outside involved with that effort.
So today, I'm going to focus on our product work. And specifically, I'm going to focus on 4 themes that I'm excited about for the year ahead: Communities, private messaging, commerce tools for small businesses and building the next computing platform. So let's start with communities.
Now I think that helping people build communities is one of the most important things that we can do. Our social fabric is made of multiple different layers through which we get our social support. First, we have friends and family, and that's the most personal layer. Then we have communities we're part of where we feel a sense of purpose and belonging, explore interests, develop skills, grow as individuals and meet new people. And then finally, there's the safety net that society and government provide. And in many parts of the world, there's been an unfortunate decline in community participation over the last several decades. That's that second layer. And this isn't something that we can solve alone but I think we can help.
So now that we've helped billions of people stay connected with friends and family, helping everyone find and participate in communities that are meaningful to them has been our next goal. And we even updated our mission a few years ago to reflect this making it -- give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. 
Today, more than 600 million people are now members of a group on Facebook that they consider to be meaningful in their lives. This has grown steadily over time. And I hear all the time from people who are in parenting groups that they are major resources to navigate raising kids; or from people who found a group that shares the same health condition, and they can lean on that community for knowledge and support; or from people who moved to a new place and joined local groups to meet people and get situated.
Our product focus now is to develop this community infrastructure beyond feeds and message boards to help people build and run full self-sustaining community institutions. So we're building tools to help groups get things done together, and provide support for people that span messaging, video chat and even communities owned websites. And we're exploring different ways to raise funds including donations, merchandise and membership fees to help group leaders support their communities' operations and hire people for different roles that are needed to build sustainable communities for the long term.
So as we continue to focus on this, we need to make sure that the communities that people connect with are healthy and positive. And that's something that we've been focused on for a while now. One way, of course, that we do this is by taking down groups that break our rules against things like violence or hate speech. And in September, we shared that we had removed more than 1 million groups in the last year alone. But there are also a lot of groups that we may not want to encourage people to join even if they don't violate our policies. So for example, we stopped recommending civic and political groups in the U.S. ahead of the elections. And we're continuing to fine-tune how this works. But now we plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term, and we plan to expand that policy globally. And to be clear, this is a continuation of work we've been doing for a while to turn down the temperature and discourage [ divisive ] conversation and communities.
Now along these same lines, we're also currently considering steps that we can take to reduce the amount of political content in News Feed as well. We're still working through exactly the best ways to do this. And to be clear, of course, we're still going to enable people to engage in political groups and discussions if they want to. These can often be important and helpful, and there can be ways that people organize grassroots movements or speak out against injustice, or learn from people with different perspectives. So we want these discussions to be able to keep happening. But one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services. So one theme, for this year, is that we're going to continue to focus on helping millions of more people participate in healthy communities, and we're going to focus even more on being a force for bringing people closer together.
Next, let's talk about private messaging. As we have discussed before, while people enjoy connecting with friends and communities in the digital equivalent of a town square in apps like Facebook and Instagram, the fastest-growing social experiences are about connecting privately in the digital equivalent of the living room in services like WhatsApp and Messenger. So that's why we kicked off a big effort a couple of years ago to reimagine what a modern social platform would look like if you build it from the bottom-up to be privacy first.
And we identified several core principles. A private social platform should be built around the most intimate interactions that we have, and that's one-on-one conversations. The most important aspect of privacy and security is that your conversations should stay between you. And that means that your conversations should always be end-to-end encrypted, and they should disappear when you're done with them. The safety and reducing spam matter, too, and that means that we should maintain a minimum amount of metadata to build sophisticated tools to stop bad actors using these services. And you should have choice over what services you use. So we should make messaging as interoperable as possible across our apps.
And finally, no matter what, we should only store people's data in countries where we know we can keep it secure. And we should continue opposing data localization in countries with weak records on human rights or privacy.
Now I think that these are the privacy principles that matter most to people. First and foremost, people care their conversations stay private. But after that, people also care about safety and other convenience, too. And from this perspective, WhatsApp, and the direction that we're heading in with Messenger, are the best private social apps available. Now we have a lot of competitors who make claims about privacy that are often misleading. Now Apple recently released so-called nutrition labels, which focused largely on metadata that apps collect rather than the privacy and security of people's actual messages. But iMessage stores non-intending encrypted backups of your messages by default unless you disable iCloud. So Apple and governments have the ability to access most people's messages. So when it comes to what matters most, protecting people's messages, I think that WhatsApp is clearly superior.
Now since I try to use these earnings calls to discuss aspects of business strategy that I think are important for investors to understand, I do want to highlight that we increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors. iMessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem. It comes pre-installed on every iPhone, and they preferenced it with private APIs and permissions, which is why iMessage is the most used messaging service in the U.S. And now we are also seeing apples business depend more and more on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers. So Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own. And this impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes, many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads.
Now Apple may say that they're doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests. And I think that this dynamic is important for people to understand because we and others are going to be up against this for the foreseeable future.
Now our messaging services continue growing, but it is an uphill battle, and our services just need to be that much better as private social platforms to succeed. So to make sure that we remain the best a couple of years back, we kicked off a number of long-term efforts that have started shipping recently. And more of these projects are on strengthening encryption, ephemerality, interoperability and offering other tools are going to be shipping throughout this year.
All right. So now let's talk about commerce. Our goal here is to give every individual entrepreneur and small business access to the same kinds of tools that historically only the big companies have had access to. And we've always cared about this, but the pandemic has made it more urgent. So it used to be the case that only large companies could afford to have analytics or targeted advertising capacity to reach their customers. And it was expensive to build these capabilities. And it often required building teams, and storing large amounts of data in-house, which most small businesses can't do. And so one of the things that I'm most proud of is that we build the tools so we can offer these same capabilities to small businesses often for free. So when you hear people say that we hold a lot of data, that's because hundreds of millions of businesses that would have otherwise had to do this individually and would have had no easy way of doing so are now using our services to help them reach customers. And when you hear people say that we're connecting data from lots of sources, that's to help small businesses reach customers more efficiently. 
Now big companies often do this themselves, but small businesses can't, a lot of time. So we do this for them. So when you hear people argue that we shouldn't be doing these things or that we should go back to the old days of untargeted television ads, I think that what they're really arguing for is a regression where only the largest companies have this capacity. Small businesses are severely disadvantaged and competition is diminished.
So with our commerce tools, we've made it so that a business can set up a shop once, and then they will have an online storefront in both Facebook and Instagram immediately, and eventually on WhatsApp and Messenger as well. And we recently expanded checkout to all U.S. businesses, making the process of buying a lot more seamless. And as the lockdowns have continued, we saw more businesses, more small businesses and creators also use paid online events as a way to make money.
WhatsApp is also an important part of our strategy here. More than 175 million people message a WhatsApp business account every day. And we're building new features to make it even easier to transact with businesses in the app. We introduced carts, which lets people browse catalogs, select multiple products and send the order as a message to a business. And the more people that interact with businesses, the better tools that we're going to need to provide for businesses to help them support their customers. Many businesses need more than a phone to manage their customer service. So we're building tools to let businesses store and manage  their WhatsApp chats using our secure hosting infrastructure if they would like. And we're in the process of updating WhatsApp's privacy policy in terms of service to reflect these optional experiences.
Now to clarify some confusion that we've seen, this update does not change the privacy of anyone's messages with friends and family. All of these messages are end-to-end encrypted, which means we can't see or hear what you say, and we never will unless the person that you message chooses to share it. And business messages will only be hosted on our infrastructure if the business chooses to do so. So we want everyone to know the lengths that we go to protect your private messages. So we are moving the date of this update back to give everyone time to understand what the update means.
Finally, let's discuss our work building the next computing platform. This is one of the areas that I'm most excited about our progress heading into 2021. If you look at the history of computing, every 15 years or so, a new major platform emerges that integrate technology more naturally and ubiquitously into our lives, starting with mainframes and PCs and browser-based computing and then mobile. And I believe that the next logical step here is an immersive computing platform that just delivers this magical sense of presence that you're really there with another person or in another place. Our phones can't deliver this, and neither can any other technology that has come before it. This is going to unlock the types of social experiences that I have dreamed about building since I was a kid. And it's what we're building towards at Facebook Reality Labs.
We launched Quest 2 in October, and it is on track to be the first mainstream virtual reality headset. We designed it so that anyone could jump in with the best and most immersive experience out there. And at a price that makes it available to as many people as possible. And I think that Facebook has done more than any other company to help bring virtual reality to the mainstream. And it has been great to see so many people embrace this, especially this year during the pandemic. We're seeing people use it to play games with friends, when they can't be together in person, to do workouts in their living room or to meet with colleagues, while they're working from home. So there are a lot of reasons that Quest 2 was one of the hot holiday gifts this year.
We're also seeing a growing ecosystem of developers, building amazing new experiences for the platform. Right now, more than 60 Oculus developers are generating revenue in the millions. And that's nearly twice as many as a few months ago. In previous quarters, I've talked about our long-term future goals when it comes to virtual reality. But I think that this quarter's results show that this future is here.
Augmented reality glasses are going to be a key part of this vision, too. We're still working on some of the foundational technology to underpin these. And the ultimate product is still some years away. But this year, we are excited to deliver a first glimpse of what will be when we launch our first pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with Luxottica. And during this pandemic, we've also seen Portal has proven to be a great way for people to stay connected. Especially over the holiday his family has had to celebrate apart. This year, we're focused on expanding the role of Portal and virtual reality presence into the workplace, bringing more features that can improve remote presence, collaboration and productivity.
2021 has a lot of unknowns. We don't know when vaccines are going to be widely available, when our teams will be back in the office or when our lives are going to start feeling normal again. But what I do know is that we're going to keep investing in and innovating on the big themes that I discussed here in order to put more power in the hands of people and small businesses. I personally believe the technology can unlock progress and opportunity. And that the full story of the Internet has not yet been written. That's why I'm hopeful for the year ahead, and grateful that you were all in this journey with us. And now here is Sheryl to talk about our business."
20765463,700255695,2182919,"Facebook, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Like Mark, I hope everyone is safe and healthy. This was a strong quarter for our business as the acceleration of online commerce we've seen during the pandemic continued into the holiday season. Our total revenue for Q4 wa",1089,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Like Mark, I hope everyone is safe and healthy. This was a strong quarter for our business as the acceleration of online commerce we've seen during the pandemic continued into the holiday season. Our total revenue for Q4 was $28.1 billion, which is a 33% year-over-year increase, our fastest growth rate in over 2 years.
After a really difficult year for so many businesses, this holiday period was important. And while many businesses are still struggling, the good news is that Q4 was stronger than expected for retail. In the U.S., the National Retail Federation reported that sales in November and December went up 8% year-over-year, and online sales were up 24%. This holiday period was also longer. Compared to previous years, advertisers started spending earlier and sustained that spend well beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We saw robust performance across all regions as well as an improvement in brand advertising.
The strength of our Q4 performance is a result of years of investments in free and paid tools to help businesses succeed online. Even before the pandemic, businesses were going digital, but COVID made this a necessity. Almost overnight, businesses had to create digital storefronts, figure out how to take online orders and find new ways to reach their customers. For many small companies, these steps are even just setting up a website or a mobile app -- can be difficult and expensive. Our free and paid tools help solve these problems for businesses around the world.
With so many businesses struggling with the pandemic hit, we asked our teams what do businesses need and how can we help. First, they need the tools to get their business up and running online. So what can we do to make ours simpler and more effective. And can we build new ones to help them. Second, they need the digital skills and know-how to succeed. So how can we help more businesses with training and resources. And third, they need their voices to be heard. So can we use our scale to amplify their voices and tell their stories. We've been asking these questions throughout the last year and into Q4.
On the first, we accelerated our work on tools to make it easier for people to find brands and products they love and for businesses to manage their online presence and connect with customers. Mark talked about some of the new tools we've launched like shops and paid online events. In the fall, we also rolled out Facebook Business Suite, a new interface to help businesses manage their pages or profiles across our apps.
We also continued to invest in making our products as effective as possible, so businesses can get more value for every dollar they spend. Personalized ads are privacy safe and help businesses reach customers where they are, which has been more important than ever during the pandemic. One notable area of progress this past year was in Stories ads, which have become more effective for direct response advertisers.
One business that used Stories ads is Carlota Flower Lab, a florist in Los Reyes, Mexico. Before COVID, they made 70% of their revenue from face-to-face workshops. So when the pandemic hit founder, Paola Mendoza had to get creative. She used personalized ads on Instagram to reach new audiences and even found her first international customers with campaigns targeting California and Texas.
One campaign for Dia de los Muertos, the day of the dead in November, led to a 24x return on ad spend, helping Paola triple her annual revenue in 2020 despite COVID.
On the second, resources and training, we did some big things in 2020. We created a business resource hub, a one-stop shop for resources and trainings for small businesses that we've continued to build out through the end of the year. We committed to reach 1 million members of the black community and 1 million members of the Latinx and Hispanic communities in the U.S. with free digital skills training through our Elevate program by 2023. The and we reimagined our boost with Facebook events to reach businesses virtually with 100 million people tuning in throughout the year. This included our 12-week season of support to help businesses across 16 countries prepare for the holidays.
On the third, a great example of how we amplify the voices of our businesses in Q4 is our #BuyBlack Friday campaign, one of my favorite campaigns ever. In the U.S. black-owned businesses closed at twice the rate of others after the start of the pandemic, so we wanted to help people shop with them over the holidays. We created ways for people to find black businesses in their local area, a gift side featuring products from black businesses across the U.S. and even a #BuyBlack Friday show on Facebook live that was seen by 15 million people.
One of the small businesses we featured is a vegan skincare brand called Redo from New York City. Its Founder Asia Grant appeared on the #BuyBlack Friday show, and that became one of our most successful sales days ever. The campaign gave her record revenue and web traffic, and she was even able to hire more people, something that's so important given current unemployment rates.
Business owners like Asia and Paola have worked hard to adapt and grow online, but lots of businesses will continue to struggle in 2021. So we're going to keep listening to them and building on what we did last year. That means improving our products and tools to help businesses seamlessly manage their online presence, advertise across our apps and communicate with customers through business messaging. It means making more training available through programs like She Means Business for women and Elevate for diverse communities. And it means finding more ways to amplify their voices, whether it's sharing the stories of small businesses worried that Apple's iOS 14 changes will hurt their ability to reach customers or showcasing small businesses and gift guides and products like businesses nearby. I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses around the world who work with us. Your partnership helps us build the tools you need so you can continue to grow and hire. And as always, I'm grateful to our incredible teams who have done so much to help businesses survive this difficult year including coming up with great ideas like #BuyBlack Friday. I hope that 2021 is a better year for everyone. Now here's Dave."

Q4 was a strong quarter, capping off a solid year for our business as full year 2020 revenue grew 22% to $86 billion. We have been encouraged to see improved demand for our ads during the second half of the year after facing significant headwinds at the onset of the pandemic. Our results reflect the ongoing strength in the digital economy and the value we're providing to millions of businesses who use our services to reach consumers and generate sales. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. In December, we estimate that approximately 2.6 billion people use at least one of our services on a daily basis and that approximately 3.3 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users reached 1.84 billion, up 11% or 188 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.8 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew 299 million or 12% compared to last year. Consistent with our outlook, U.S. and Canada DAU declined 1 million sequentially as usage continued to normalize from peak COVID levels experienced earlier in the year.
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $28.1 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been $339 million lower.
Q4 ad revenue was $27.2 billion, up 31% or 30% on a constant currency basis. The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by a strong holiday shopping season for retail, which benefited from the ongoing shift to online commerce.
On a user geography basis, ad revenue was strongest in Europe, which grew 35% and benefited from currency tailwinds; U.S. and Canada grew 31%; and Asia Pacific grew 29%. Rest of world growth improved to 25%, but continues to be significantly impacted by currency headwinds. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 25%, and the average price per ad increased 5%. Impression growth was driven by both Facebook and Instagram. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by Facebook mobile feed as well as pricing improvement in Instagram Stories. Other revenue was $885 million, up 156% due to strong Quest 2 holiday sales. We've been encouraged by the positive perception of Quest 2 since its October launch.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total expenses were $15.3 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of specific line items, cost of revenue increased 49% driven primarily by hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales core infrastructure investments and payments to partners. R&D increased 34% driven primarily by hiring and investments in core products as well as our consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 8%, driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses decreased 13% as we lap charges related to the -- legal settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the past year, we added a record 13,600 net employees and reached our goal of adding 10,000 employees in tech and product roles. We ended the year with over 58,600 full-time employees, up 30% compared to last year. We continue to be pleased with our ability to recruit, onboard and retain talent in this environment.
Fourth quarter operating income was $12.8 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our tax rate was 14%. Net income was $11.2 billion or $3.88 per share. Capital expenditures were $4.8 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $9.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $62 billion in cash and marketable securities.
For the full year, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and had $8.6 billion remaining in our prior authorization as of December 31. Today, we announced a $25 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization.
Turning now to the outlook. We continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of cross currents in 2021. We believe our business has benefited from 2 broad economic trends playing out during the pandemic. The first is the ongoing shift to online commerce. The second is the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services. We believe these shifts provided a tailwind to our advertising business in the second half of 2020, given our strength in product verticals sold via online commerce and our lower exposure to service verticals like travel. Looking forward, a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth.
At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic. As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates. We also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14 as well as the evolving regulatory landscape. While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter.
There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments. And like other companies in our industry, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress.
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $68 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. This is driven by investments in technical and product talent as well as continued growth in infrastructure costs. We continue to expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21 billion to $23 billion driven by data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Our outlook includes spend that was delayed from 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on our construction efforts. 
Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rates to be in the high teens. In closing, 2020 was a unique operating environment that introduced a number of unforeseen challenges. We have been pleased with our team's ability to adapt in order to maintain the reliability of our services, deliver new products and experiences and support the millions of businesses who use our platforms to reach consumers.
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions."

I think last quarter, you mentioned you had 10 million advertisers. So maybe talk to us about sort of some of the segments of advertisers you think that you're missing. And what initiatives do you have in place to sort of broaden the advertiser base to bring more services on the platform."

Spending on goods actually surged to record levels or the highest in like 15 years. We don't have the results for Q4, but we expect that sort of trend continued.
If you look at the balance of our  business, it tends to skew more towards products relative to the overall GDP -- or the overall consumer spend in, for instance, the U.S. So we just think we're overall exposed a little bit more to products. We continue to invest to improve our exposure and travel -- sorry, in service areas like travel. But our expectation would be in 2021, we'll continue to have a similar skew towards products as we've had in the past. But we'll continue to make investments to make our ad products more relevant for services as well."

So that's going to be true whether you're using IDFA or not. And we do expect there to be high opt out rates related to that, and that's factored into our outlook. We expect that to roll out sometime -- we expect later in Q1. But the timing is uncertain, and Apple hasn't given clarity on that at this point. And we do expect that will have increasing impact through the year as more users adopt iOS 14 and go through those permissions.
When you think about what the mitigations might be, obviously, there's going to be mitigation of the impact on us, to some extent, just because this is a platform-wide change and so it will impact everyone. And so that's going to mitigate it to some extent. And in addition, over time, we hope to help businesses by providing more on-site conversion opportunities through initiatives like shops, and also click to messaging ads.
As it relates to, specifically, the audience network products, obviously, that's going to have a significant impact on audience network on iOS as we have explained in the past. But it's -- but the broader impact given the size of that business is really to our -- to the core advertising business on iOS."

So when we started working on virtual and augmented reality, we basically laid out a path where we knew that virtual reality would be practical to build first. And we view that it's kind of all part of one continuous ecosystem for spatial, immersive computing and presence. So the key things that we're trying to do with VR now. I do believe that Quest 2 is the first mainstream virtual reality product that is doing quite well, and I'm really proud of what we've been able to do there. The goal there is we keep on shipping content and titles and working with developers and shipping new capabilities to the device. Like last year, we shipped the ability to do now [ hand ] tracking, which no one expected to be possible yet, but the team working on that did some really great work. And it just made the device better and increased the value.
So the -- we're continuing to work on new hardware as well. The new hardware will kind of fit the same platform. So the content that works on Quest 2 should be forward compatible. And so that way we're going to build one kind of larger installed base around the virtual reality headsets that we have. And at the same time, we're building towards a future with some of this -- the fundamental technology investments that we're making to be able to provide augmented reality glasses that hopefully will be able to support a lot of the same content in this ecosystem over time and take advantage of a lot of these foundational investments that we've made. 
So this is -- this continues to be a long-term investment. I think it's very important both for the vision of what we want to do. Like I said in my script before -- earlier, it's just some of the things that we're going to be able to build with VR and AR are the types of social experiences that I wanted to build since I was a kid, and I'm excited to be able to unlock that. And I also think strategically, it's important for us to have a little more control of our own destiny in terms of the operating systems and platforms that all of our services operate on. So continue to be very focused on this and optimistic about what we're seeing."

I think the context is we have this -- we've had a tremendously strong quarter Q4 of this year. A number of factors we talked about driving that. A couple of are pandemic related which is just the shift to online commerce as well as the ongoing -- the shift to more spend on products versus services. In Q4, we also saw strength with sort of our full range of advertisers. We have seen sort of small- and medium-sized businesses come back and start getting strength in Q2 and Q3 or Q3 specifically. And then Q4, we also saw strength from some of our largest advertisers as well.
So as you look out in 2021, I think we're just going to be facing tougher comps in the back half of the year. Some of those things related to the pandemic had the potential to revert, whether it's more consumer expenditure shifting towards services away from products, so that will make it a little bit of a tougher comp. And then you layer on top of that headwind to growth related to privacy-related headwinds. The biggest factor there is iOS 14. So we certainly anticipate growth, but we're just looking at tougher comps as we hit the back half of the year, given really, most importantly, the strength that we saw this year. And then on top of that, the headwinds that we're seeing from some of the privacy changes."

And I think that we can potentially do a better job of those core jobs that we have and do a better job of helping to bring people together and helping to promote healthier communities if we can reduce the amount of politics on our services.
Now I mean it's -- we'll have to balance this carefully because we have a deep commitment to free expression. So I believe that if people want to be able to discuss the stuff or join groups there, they should certainly be able to do that. But I just don't think that it's serving the community particularly well to be recommending that content right now.
But one thing to mention just because you were asking about the headwinds and all that is, I don't think that this is a factor in any of that. And Wehner can jump in if there's any more that you want to add on that. But I don't think that, that's what he had in mind in any way there. Wehner, I'll skip a beat for you to jump in if you want before going to the next question."

And now going to your 230 question, I do think -- and I testified this -- about this in Congress. I do think that Congress should update Section 230 to make sure that it's working the way that people intend, right? And it's after, I think, being in place for almost 25 years. And the Section 230 has been very important. It's helped give rise to the Internet as we know it today. And it's given Internet platforms tools to be able to balance free expression and safety. And I think it's also gone pretty far in terms of helping to ensure that values like free expression are built into the Internet's DNA. So I think that any changes should be thought through very carefully. And should be thought through not just from the perspective of what a larger company like Facebook or Google or Twitter could handle in terms of updating their content moderation policies, but also from the perspective of making sure that new companies can continue to emerge. I think that's very important as well.
So we've supported changes in this for a while. Back in 2018, we supported a change to prevent sex trafficking. And we'll support similar efforts to tackle harms like child exploitation, imagery and material and opioids. And we'll also support the new push to make content moderation systems more transparent. The details on all this, of course, matter, but we hope to be able to work with the new Congress on this."

There are both different types of content that show up in news feed that people interact with. But my guess is that it's probably already a pretty meaningful driver of the business and the value that people get from the services today. So absolutely, I think as this continues to grow, it should be in the future.
The big trend that we're looking at now, and that I tried to call out in my remarks earlier, is that right now, there's a spectrum of different kinds of groups and communities on Facebook. Everything from meme groups that people find very entertaining and fun to groups that people really turn to for support when they have kind of serious issues in their lives. And I think that right now, though, most of these communities, they have this backbone of there's a feed, there are ways to message people. But when I think about the physical communities that I'm a part of, in my life, they often have more of an institutional structure, right? There are subcommunities. There are people who -- it's their full-time job to basically help people engage and basically help people navigate them. I'm thinking about things like the synagogue that I'm a member of, right? I mean there are people there whose job it is to help engage the congregation. And help them get basically the most out of everything that the institution has to offer, and that's a very important kind of community organization. And I would love for more institutions like that to be able to organize and build community more effectively online. So there are lots of just different tools that I think that if we provide spanning messaging, spanning video chat, these organizations own websites and other things that they do that if we can help in a lot of those areas, then we can make it that groups on Facebook are not just to feed and a place where you post some content and maybe engage on a post, but that we can really help more organizations build up community institutions like that. And I think that, that could be a very big contribution and something that I'm excited about taking on."

So small businesses are very reliant on personalized ads, the ability to use data in a very privacy safe way, to get the customers who are interested in their products and services. And that makes sense. Big businesses, we can buy an ad to the whole country. We can buy an ad to a whole region. Small businesses can't. They have to find the precise audiences they want. And I think one of the mainstays of our business is we've enabled that targeting in a very privacy safe way without giving information without permission to advertisers.
And what's happening with IDFA is that small businesses are really concerned because they're worried that they're not going to be able to buy effective advertising. If all personalized ads went away, small businesses would see a 60% cut in website sales. Now we don't think Apple's contemplating going that far that quickly, but that is the general direction of what would happen. And you can see that, that would be very detrimental to their business. It's also very detrimental to economic growth because so much of our job growth comes from small businesses.
I think it's worth noting, it's not just about advertisers. Some of these changes also impact developers and other forms of businesses. We are starting to hear from creators and developers who are worried that some of their free services will have to start charging or shut down, force them into subscriptions or other in payments for revenue. Now not all small businesses are aware of these challenges, but we are hearing from more and more of them, so are very concerned."

I hope you are all staying healthy and well. Our community and business had a strong end of the year. As COVID continued to keep many of us apart and at home, people and businesses continue relying on our services to stay in touch and create economic opportunities. 2.6 billion people now use one or more of our apps each day, and more than 200 million businesses, mostly small businesses, use our free tools to reach customers. Those numbers give a sense of scale but some of the stories we hear show the impact. 
Groups have formed where COVID long-haulers are helping each other through this scary experience where there's not much else to turn to. Teachers are sending class assignments to students through WhatsApp. Local bookstores and coffee shops are using Instagram to let customers know they're open for curbside pickup. We saw people come together to raise $1.8 billion for nonprofit and personal causes through our fundraising tools last year, including $175 million for COVID-related causes alone. I'm proud of the role that our services played in helping people support each other during what has been such a hard time. 
Now I've spent a fair amount of time on recent earnings calls talking about our election integrity efforts. So I'm not going to discuss them at length today, but I do want to call out that according to our estimates, we easily surpassed our goal to help 4 million people register to vote as part of the largest-ever effort -- largest effort to distribute authoritative voting information in recent history. And I want to thank everyone involved in our teams and outside involved with that effort. 
So today, I'm going to focus on our product work, and specifically, I'm going to focus on 4 themes that I'm excited about for the year ahead: communities; private messaging; commerce tools for small businesses; and building the next computing platform. 
So let's start with communities. Now I think that helping people build communities is one of the most important things that we can do. Our social fabric is made of multiple different layers through which we get our social support. First, we have friends and family, and that's the most personal layer. Then we have communities we're part of, where we feel a sense of purpose and belonging, explore interests, develop skills, grow as individuals and then meet new people. And then finally, there's the safety net that society and government provide. And in many parts of the world, there's been an unfortunate decline in community participation over the last several decades, that second layer. And this isn't something that we can solve alone but I think we can help. 
So now that we've helped billions of people stay connected with friends and family, helping everyone find and participate in communities that are meaningful to them has been our next goal. And we even updated our mission a few years ago to reflect this, making it -- give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Today, more than 600 million people are now members of a group on Facebook that they consider to be meaningful in their lives. This has grown steadily over time. And I hear all the time from people who are in parenting groups that there are major resources to navigate raising kids or from people who found a group that shares the same health condition and they can lean on that community for knowledge and support, or from people who've moved to a new place and joined local groups to meet people and get situated. 
Our product focus now is to develop this community infrastructure beyond feeds and message boards to help people build and run full, self-sustaining community institutions. So we're building tools to help groups get things done together and provide support for people that span messaging, video chat and even communities' own websites. And we're exploring different ways to raise funds, including donations, merchandise and membership fees to help group leaders support their communities' operations and hire people for different roles that are needed to build sustainable communities for the long term. 
So as we continue to focus on this, we need to make sure that the communities that people connect with are healthy and positive. And that's something that we've been focused on for a while now. One way, of course, that we do this is by taking down groups that break our rules against things like violence or hate speech. And in September, we shared that we had removed more than 1 million groups in the last year alone. But there are also a lot of groups that we may not want to encourage people to join even if they don't violate our policies. So for example, we stopped recommending civic and political groups in the U.S. ahead of the elections. And we're continuing to fine-tune how this works, but now we plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term and we plan to expand that policy globally. And to be clear, this is a continuation of work we've been doing for a while to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation and communities. 
Now along these same lines, we're also currently considering steps that we can take to reduce the amount of political content in News Feed as well. We're still working through exactly the best ways to do this. And to be clear, of course, we're still going to enable people to engage in political groups and discussions if they want to. These can often be important and helpful, and there can be ways that people organize grassroots movements or speak out against injustice or learn from people with different perspectives. So we want these discussions to be able to keep happening, but one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services. So one theme for this year is that we're going to continue to focus on helping millions of more people participate in healthy communities, and we're going to focus even more on being a force for bringing people closer together. 
Next, let's talk about private messaging. As we've discussed before, while people enjoy connecting with friends and communities in the digital equivalent of a town square in apps like Facebook and Instagram, the fastest-growing social experiences are about connecting privately in the digital equivalent of the living room in services like WhatsApp and Messenger. So that's why we kicked off a big effort a couple of years ago to reimagine what a modern social platform would look like if you build it from the bottom-up to be privacy first. 
And we identified several core principles. A private social platform should be built around the most intimate interactions that we have, and that's one-on-one conversations. The most important aspect of privacy and security is that your conversations should stay between you. And that means that your conversations should always be end-to-end encrypted and they should disappear when you're done with them. Now safety and reducing spam matter, too, and that means that we should maintain a minimum amount of metadata to build sophisticated tools to stop bad actors using these services. And you should have choice over what services you use. So we should make messaging as interoperable as possible across our apps. And finally, no matter what, we should only store people's data in countries where we know we can keep it secure, and we should continue opposing data localization in countries with weak records on human rights or privacy. 
Now I think that these are the privacy principles that matter most to people. First and foremost, people care that their conversations stay private. But after that, people also care about safety and other convenience, too. And from this perspective, WhatsApp and the direction that we're heading in with Messenger are the best private social apps available. Now we have a lot of competitors who make claims about privacy that are often misleading. Now Apple recently released so-called nutrition labels which focused largely on metadata that apps collect rather than the privacy and security of people's actual messages, but iMessage stores ""non end to end encrypted"" backups of your messages by default unless you disable iCloud. So Apple and governments have the ability to access most people's messages. So when it comes to what matters most, protecting people's messages, I think that WhatsApp is clearly superior. 
Now since I try to use these earnings calls to discuss aspects of business strategy that I think are important for investors to understand, I do want to highlight that we increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors. iMessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem. It comes pre-installed on every iPhone, and they preferenced it with private APIs and permissions, which is why iMessage is the most used messaging service in the U.S. And now we are also seeing Apple's business depend more and more on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers. 
So Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own. And this impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world. Including -- with the upcoming iOS 14 changes, many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads. Now Apple may say that they're doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests. And I think that this dynamic is important for people to understand because we and others are going to be up against this for the foreseeable future. 
Now our messaging services continue growing, but it is an uphill battle and our services just need to be that much better as private social platforms to succeed. So to make sure that we remain the best, a couple of years back, we kicked off a number of long-term efforts that have started shipping recently. And more of these projects around strengthening encryption, ephemerality, interoperability and offering other tools are going to be shipping throughout this year. 
All right. So now let's talk about commerce. Our goal here is to give every individual, entrepreneur and small business access to the same kinds of tools that historically only the big companies have had access to. And we've always cared about this but the pandemic has made it more urgent. So it used to be the case that only large companies could afford to have analytics or targeted advertising capacity to reach their customers. And it was expensive to build these capabilities, and it often required building teams and storing large amounts of data in-house, which most small businesses can't do. 
And so one of the things that I'm most proud of is that we build the tools so we can offer these same capabilities to small businesses often for free. So when you hear people say that we hold a lot of data, that's because hundreds of millions of businesses that would have otherwise had to do this individually and would have had no easy way of doing so are now using our services to help them reach customers. And when you hear people say that we're connecting data from lots of sources, that's to help small businesses reach customers more efficiently. Now big companies often do this themselves, but small businesses can't a lot of times. So we do this for them. So when you hear people argue that we shouldn't be doing these things or that we should go back to the old days of untargeted television ads, I think that what they're really arguing for is a regression where only the largest companies have this capacity, small businesses are severely disadvantaged and competition is diminished. 
So with our commerce tools, we've made it so that a business can set up a shop once, and then they will have an online storefront in both Facebook and Instagram immediately and eventually on WhatsApp and Messenger as well. And we recently expanded checkout to all U.S. businesses, making the process of buying a lot more seamless. And as the lockdowns have continued, we saw more businesses, more small businesses and creators also use paid online events as a way to make money. 
WhatsApp is also an important part of our strategy here. More than 175 million people message a WhatsApp business account every day. And we're building new features to make it even easier to transact with businesses in the app. We introduced carts, which lets people browse catalogs, select multiple products and send the order as a message to a business. And the more people that interact with businesses, the better tools that we're going to need to provide for businesses to help them support their customers. Many businesses need more than a phone to manage their customer service. So we're building tools to let businesses store and manage their WhatsApp chats using our secure hosting infrastructure if they would like. And we're in the process of updating WhatsApp's privacy policy in terms of service to reflect these optional experiences. 
Now to clarify some confusion that we've seen, this update does not change the privacy of anyone's messages with friends and family. All of these messages are end-to-end encrypted, which means we can't see or hear what you say, and we never will unless the person that you message chooses to share it. And business messages will only be hosted on our infrastructure if the business chooses to do so. So we want everyone to know the lengths that we go to, to protect your private messages. So we are moving the date of this update back to give everyone time to understand what the update means. 
Finally, let's discuss our work building the next computing platform. This is one of the areas that I'm most excited about our progress heading into 2021. If you look at the history of computing, every 15 years or so, a new major platform emerges that integrate technology more naturally and ubiquitously into our lives, starting with mainframes and PCs and browser-based computing and then mobile. And I believe that the next logical step here is an immersive computing platform that just delivers this magical sense of presence that you're really there with another person or in another place. Our phones can't deliver this, and neither can any other technology that has come before it. This is going to unlock the types of social experiences that I have dreamed about building since I was a kid, and it's what we're building towards at Facebook Reality Labs. 
We launched Quest 2 in October, and it is on track to be the first mainstream virtual reality headset. We designed it so that anyone could jump in with the best and most immersive experience out there and at a price that makes it available to as many people as possible. Now I think that Facebook has done more than any other company to help bring virtual reality to the mainstream, and it has been great to see so many people embrace this, especially this year during the pandemic. We're seeing people use it to play games with friends, when they can't be together in person, to do workouts in their living room or to meet with colleagues while they're working from home. So there are a lot of reasons that Quest 2 was one of the hot holiday gifts this year. We're also seeing a growing ecosystem of developers building amazing new experiences for the platform. Right now, more than 60 Oculus developers are generating revenue in the millions, and that's nearly twice as many as a few months ago. 
In previous quarters, I've talked about our long-term future goals when it comes to virtual reality, but I think that this quarter's results show that this future is here. Augmented reality glasses are going to be a key part of this vision, too. We're still working on some of the foundational technology to underpin these and the ultimate product is still some years away, but this year, we are excited to deliver a first glimpse of what will be when we launch our first pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with Luxottica. And during this pandemic, we've also seen Portal has proven to be a great way for people to stay connected especially over the holidays as families had to celebrate apart. This year, we're focused on expanding the role of Portal and virtual reality presence into the workplace, bringing more features that can improve remote presence, collaboration and productivity. 
2021 has a lot of unknowns. We don't know when vaccines are going to be widely available, when our teams will be back in the office or when our lives are going to start feeling normal again. But what I do know is that we're going to keep investing in and innovating on the big themes that I discussed here in order to put more power in the hands of people and small businesses. I personally believe that technology can unlock progress and opportunity and that the full story of the Internet has not yet been written. That's why I'm hopeful for the year ahead and grateful that you are all in this journey with us. 
And now here is Sheryl to talk about our business."
20765463,700255695,2183203,"Facebook, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Like Mark, I hope everyone is safe and healthy. This was a strong quarter for our business as the acceleration of online commerce we've seen during the pandemic continued into the holiday season. Our total revenue for Q4 wa",1084,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Like Mark, I hope everyone is safe and healthy. This was a strong quarter for our business as the acceleration of online commerce we've seen during the pandemic continued into the holiday season. Our total revenue for Q4 was $28.1 billion, which is a 33% year-over-year increase, our fastest growth rate in over 2 years. 
After a really difficult year for so many businesses, this holiday period was important. And while many businesses are still struggling, the good news is that Q4 was stronger than expected for retail. In the U.S., the National Retail Federation reported that sales in November and December went up 8% year-over-year and online sales were up 24%. This holiday period was also longer. Compared to previous years, advertisers started spending earlier and sustained that spend well beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We saw robust performance across regions as well as an improvement in brand advertising. 
The strength of our Q4 performance is a result of years of investments in free and paid tools to help businesses succeed online. Even before the pandemic, businesses were going digital, but COVID made this a necessity. Almost overnight, businesses had to create digital storefronts, figure out how to take online orders and find new ways to reach their customers. For many small companies, these steps or even just setting up a website or a mobile app can be difficult and expensive. Our free and paid tools help solve these problems for businesses around the world. 
With so many businesses struggling when the pandemic hit, we asked our teams what do businesses need and how can we help. First, they need the tools to get their business up and running online. So what can we do to make ours simpler and more effective? And can we build new ones to help them? Second, they need the digital skills and know-how to succeed. So how can we help more businesses with training and resources? And third, they need their voices to be heard. So can we use our scale to amplify their voices and tell their stories? We've been asking these questions throughout the last year and into Q4. 
On the first, we accelerated our work on tools to make it easier for people to find brands and products they love and for businesses to manage their online presence and connect with customers. Mark talked about some of the new tools we've launched, like shops and paid online events. In the fall, we also rolled out Facebook Business Suite, a new interface to help businesses manage their pages or profiles across our apps. 
We also continued to invest in making our products as effective as possible so businesses can get more value for every dollar they spend. Personalized ads are privacy-safe and help businesses reach customers where they are, which has been more important than ever during the pandemic. One notable area of progress this past year was in Stories ads, which have become more effective for direct-response advertisers. 
One business that used Stories ads is Carlota Flower Lab, a florist in Los Reyes, Mexico. Before COVID, they made 70% of their revenue from face-to-face workshops. So when the pandemic hit, founder Paola Mendoza had to get creative. She used personalized ads on Instagram to reach new audiences and even found her first international customers with campaigns targeting California and Texas. One campaign for Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead in November, led to a 24x return on ad spend, helping Paola triple her annual revenue in 2020 despite COVID.
On the second, resources and training, we did some big things in 2020. We created a Business Resource Hub, a one-stop shop for resources and trainings for small businesses that we've continued to build out through the end of the year. We committed to reach 1 million members of the black community and 1 million members of the Latinx and Hispanic communities in the U.S. with free digital skills training through our Elevate program by 2023. And we reimagined our Boost with Facebook events to reach businesses virtually with 100 million people tuning in throughout the year. This included our 12-week season of support to help businesses across 16 countries prepare for the holidays.
On the third, a great example of how we amplify the voices of our businesses in Q4 is our #BuyBlack Friday campaign, one of my favorite campaigns ever. In the U.S., black-owned businesses closed at twice the rate of others after the start of the pandemic. So we wanted to help people shop with them over the holidays. We created ways for people to find black businesses in their local area, a gift site featuring products from black businesses across the U.S. and even a #BuyBlack Friday show on Facebook Live that was seen by 15 million people.
One of the small businesses we featured is a vegan skincare brand called Redoux from New York City. Its founder, Asia Grant, appeared on the #BuyBlack Friday show, and that became one of her most successful sales days ever. The campaign gave her record revenue and web traffic, and she was even able to hire more people, something that's so important given current unemployment rates.
Business owners like Asia and Paola have worked hard to adapt and grow online, but lots of businesses will continue to struggle in 2021. So we're going to keep listening to them and building on what we did last year. That means improving our products and tools to help businesses seamlessly manage their online presence, advertise across our apps and communicate with customers through business messaging. It means making more training available through programs like She Means Business for women and Elevate for diverse communities. And it means finding more ways to amplify their voices, whether it's sharing the stories of small businesses worried that Apple's iOS 14 changes will hurt their ability to reach customers or showcasing small businesses and gift guides and products like businesses nearby. 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses around the world who work with us. Your partnership helps us build the tools you need so you can continue to grow and hire. And as always, I'm grateful to our incredible teams who have done so much to help businesses survive this difficult year, including coming up with great ideas like #BuyBlack Friday. I hope that 2021 is a better year for everyone. 
Now here's Dave."

Q4 was a strong quarter, capping off a solid year for our business as full year 2020 revenue grew 22% to $86 billion. We have been encouraged to see improved demand for our ads during the second half of the year after facing significant headwinds at the onset of the pandemic. Our results reflect the ongoing strength in the digital economy and the value we're providing to millions of businesses who use our services to reach consumers and generate sales. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. In December, we estimate that approximately 2.6 billion people use at least one of our services on a daily basis and that approximately 3.3 billion people use at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users reached 1.84 billion, up 11% or 188 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.8 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew 299 million or 12% compared to last year. Consistent with our outlook, U.S. and Canada DAU declined 1 million sequentially as usage continued to normalize from peak COVID levels experienced earlier in the year.
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $28.1 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind, and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been $339 million lower. 
Q4 ad revenue was $27.2 billion, up 31% or 30% on a constant currency basis. The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by a strong holiday shopping season for retail, which benefited from the ongoing shift to online commerce. On a user geography basis, ad revenue was strongest in Europe, which grew 35% and benefited from currency tailwinds; U.S. and Canada grew 31%; and Asia Pacific grew 29%. Rest of world growth improved 25% but continues to be significantly impacted by currency headwinds. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 25% and the average price per ad increased 5%. Impression growth was driven by both Facebook and Instagram. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by Facebook mobile feed as well as pricing improvement in Instagram Stories. 
Other revenue was $885 million, up 156% due to strong Quest 2 holiday sales. We've been encouraged by the positive reception of Quest 2 since its October launch.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total expenses were $15.3 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of specific line items, cost of revenue increased 49% driven primarily by hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales, core infrastructure investments and payments to partners. R&D increased 34% driven primarily by hiring and investments in core products as well as our consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 8%, driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses decreased 13% as we lapped charges related to the BIPA legal settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the past year, we added a record 13,600 net employees and reached our goal of adding 10,000 employees in tech and product roles. We ended the year with over 58,600 full-time employees, up 30% compared to last year. We continue to be pleased with our ability to recruit, onboard and retain talent in this environment.
Fourth quarter operating income was $12.8 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our tax rate was 14%. Net income was $11.2 billion or $3.88 per share. Capital expenditures were $4.8 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $9.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $62 billion in cash and marketable securities.
For the full year, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and had $8.6 billion remaining in our prior authorization as of December 31. Today, we announced a $25 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization.
Turning now to the outlook. We continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of crosscurrents in 2021. We believe our business has benefited from 2 broad economic trends playing out during the pandemic. The first is the ongoing shift to online commerce. The second is the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services. We believe these shifts provided a tailwind to our advertising business in the second half of 2020, given our strength in product verticals sold via online commerce and our lower exposure to service verticals like travel. Looking forward, a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth.
At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic. As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates. 
We also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14 as well as the evolving regulatory landscape. While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning in the late first -- beginning late in the first quarter.
There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments. And like other companies in our industry, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress.
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $68 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. This is driven by investments in technical and product talent as well as continued growth in infrastructure costs. We continue to expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21 billion to $23 billion driven by data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Our outlook includes spend that was delayed from 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on our construction efforts. 
Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rates to be in the high teens. 
In closing, 2020 was a unique operating environment that introduced a number of unforeseen challenges. We have been pleased with our team's ability to adapt in order to maintain the reliability of our services, deliver new products and experiences and support the millions of businesses who use our platforms to reach consumers.
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions."

And then the second one, Dave, in -- appreciate the comment on the forward outlook and the outlook commentary. I guess the question is -- you sort of talk about this shift to consumer expenditure toward products away from services that could potentially be a headwind in the back half as it reverses. I think last quarter, you mentioned you had 10 million advertisers. So maybe talk to us about sort of some of the segments of advertisers you think that you're missing and what initiatives do you have in place to sort of broaden the advertiser base to bring more services on the platform."

Yes, the data that we've looked at there really is that when you look at the data from the U.S. BEA, it basically showed that in Q3, while the services consumer spend was still down year-over-year, spending on goods actually surged to record levels or the highest in like 15 years. We don't have the results for Q4, but we expect that sort of trend continued. If you look at the balance of our business, it tends to skew more towards products relative to the overall GDP and -- or the overall consumer spend in, for instance, the U.S. So we just think we're overall exposed a little bit more to products. We continue to invest to improve our exposure and travel -- sorry, in service areas like travel. But our expectation would be in 2021, we'll continue to have a similar skew towards products as we've had in the past. But we'll continue to make investments to make our ad products more relevant for services as well."

We continue to believe that, that will be a headwind in the ads business. It's, in our view, not just limited to IDFA, but broader than that is we're going to have to be providing a prompt, asking people for permission to use third-party data to deliver personalized ads. So that's going to be true whether you're using IDFA or not. And we do expect there to be high opt-out rates related to that, and that's factored into our outlook. We expect that to roll out sometime -- we expect later in Q1. But the timing is uncertain, and Apple hasn't given clarity on that at this point. And we do expect that will have increasing impact through the year as more users adopt iOS 14 and go through those permissions.
When you think about what the mitigations might be, obviously, there's going to be mitigation of the impact on us, to some extent, just because this is a platform-wide change. And so it will impact everyone. And so that's going to mitigate it to some extent. And in addition, over time, we hope to help businesses by providing more on-site conversion opportunities through initiatives like shops and also click-to-messaging ads.
As it relates to specifically the Audience Network products, obviously, that's going to have a significant impact on Audience Network on iOS, as we've explained in the past. But it's -- but the broader impact given the size of that business is really to our -- to the core advertising business on iOS."

So when we started working on virtual and augmented reality, we basically laid out a path where we knew that virtual reality would be practical to build first. And we view that it's kind of all part of one continuous ecosystem for spatial, immersive computing and presence, so the key things that we're trying to do with VR now. 
I do believe that Quest 2 is the first mainstream virtual reality product that is doing quite well, and I'm really proud of what we've been able to do there. The goal there is we keep on shipping content and titles and working with developers and shipping new capabilities to the device. Like last year, we shipped the ability to do -- now hand-tracking, which no one expected to be possible yet, but the team working on that did some really great work. And it just made the device better and increased the value. 
So the -- we're continuing to work on new hardware as well. The new hardware will kind of fit the same platform. So the content that works on Quest 2 should be forward-compatible. And so that way, we're going to build one kind of larger installed base around the virtual reality headsets that we have. And at the same time, we're building towards a future with some of this -- the fundamental technology investments that we're making to be able to provide augmented reality glasses that hopefully will be able to support a lot of the same content in this ecosystem over time and take advantage of a lot of these foundational investments that we've made. 
So this is -- this continues to be a long-term investment. I think it's very important both for the vision of what we want to do. Like I said in my script before -- earlier, it's just some of the things that we're going to be able to build with VR and AR are the types of social experiences that I wanted us to -- I wanted to build since I was a kid, and I'm excited to be able to unlock that. And I also think strategically, it's important for us to have a little more control of our own destiny in terms of the operating systems and platforms that all of our services operate on, so continue to be very focused on this and optimistic about what we're seeing."

A couple of are pandemic-related, which is just the shift to online commerce as well as the ongoing -- the shift to more spend on products versus services. In Q4, we also saw strength with sort of our full range of advertisers. We have seen sort of small- and medium-sized businesses come back and start getting strength in Q2 and Q3 or Q3 specifically. And then Q4, we also saw strength from some of our largest advertisers as well.
So as you look out in 2021, I think we're just going to be facing tougher comps in the back half of the year. Some of those things related to the pandemic had the potential to revert, whether it's more consumer expenditure shifting towards services away from products. So that will make it a little bit of a tougher comp. And then you layer on top of that headwind to growth related to privacy-related headwinds. The biggest factor there is iOS 14. So we certainly anticipate growth, but we're just looking at tougher comps as we hit the back half of the year given really, most importantly, the strength that we saw this year and then, on top of that, the headwinds that we're seeing from some of the privacy changes."

In commerce and supporting small businesses, I think there, you have some of the iOS 14 changes that we think are going to be very problematic especially for small businesses. And then longer term, as we move towards building the next computing platform, I think we would expect to see them as more of a competitor there as well.

And so we would expect that sort of overall story to continue into Q1 with those trends. 
And then we're also continuing to make iterative improvements that enhance the performance and benefit pricing over time. And the one example that we give there is Instagram Stories that, as you know, it's been an area we've been focused on to try and make DR performance through better ads in our activity work better on Stories, and we've been seeing some good progress there. So we called that out as well as being a driver of price improvement. There's still a gap with Stories ads and feed ads, but we've been pleased with the progress we've been making on that front."

I also think the kind of aesthetic and focus of the apps on how much different functionality they include will vary. I think WhatsApp has always had -- we've always focused a lot on making it a very utilitarian experience and place more of a premium on simplicity there.

And it's -- and all the feedback that we have from our communities suggest that the vast majority of people would like to -- would like it to stay that way. And I think there has been this trend, I think, across society where a lot of things have become politicized and politics has kind of had a way of creeping into everything. And I think a lot of the work that we're -- a lot of the feedback that we see from our communities is that people don't want that in their experience. They come to our services to connect with friends and family, to connect to communities that they care about. And I think that we can potentially do a better job of those core jobs that we have and do a better job of helping to bring people together and helping to promote healthier communities if we can reduce the amount of politics on our services.
Now I mean it's -- we'll have to balance this carefully because we have a deep commitment to free expression. So I believe that if people want to be able to discuss the stuff or join groups there, they should certainly be able to do that. But I just don't think that it's serving the community particularly well to be recommending that content right now.
But one thing to mention just because you were asking about the headwinds and all that is I don't think that this is a factor in any of that. And Wehner can jump in if there's any more that you want to add on that. But I don't think that that's what he had in mind in any way there.

I do think that Congress should update Section 230 to make sure that it's working the way that people intend, right? And it's after, I think, being in place for almost 25 years. And the Section 230 has been very important. It's helped give rise to the Internet as we know it today, and it's given Internet platforms tools to be able to balance free expression and safety. And I think it's also gone pretty far in terms of helping to ensure that values like free expression are built into the Internet's DNA. So I think that any changes should be thought through very carefully and should be thought through not just from the perspective of what a larger company like Facebook or Google or Twitter could handle in terms of updating their content moderation policies but also from the perspective of making sure that new companies can continue to emerge. I think that's very important as well.
So we've supported changes in this for a while. Back in 2018, we supported a change to prevent sex trafficking. And we'll support similar efforts to tackle harms like child exploitation, imagery and material and opioids. And we'll also support a new push to make content moderation systems more transparent. The details on all this, of course, matter, but we hope to be able to work with the new Congress on this."

First, for the business -- and I don't think we've looked at communities separately from friends and family. They're both different types of content that show up in News Feed that people interact with, but my guess is that",395,"I can speak to the first point. First, for the business -- and I don't think we've looked at communities separately from friends and family. They're both different types of content that show up in News Feed that people interact with, but my guess is that it's probably already a pretty meaningful driver of the business and the value that people get from the services today. So absolutely, I think as this continues to grow, it should be in the future.
The big trend that we're looking at now and that I tried to call out in my remarks earlier is that right now, there's a spectrum of different kinds of groups and communities on Facebook, everything from meme groups that people find very entertaining and fun to groups that people really turn to for support when they have kind of serious issues in their lives. And I think that right now though, most of these communities, they have this backbone of -- there's a feed. There are ways to message people. 
But when I think about the physical communities that I'm a part of, in my life, they often have more of an institutional structure, right? There are subcommunities. There are people who -- it's their full-time job to basically help people engage and basically help people navigate them. I'm thinking about things like the synagogue that I'm a member of, right? I mean there are people there whose job is to help engage the congregation and help them get basically the most out of everything that the institution has to offer, and that's a very important kind of community organization. And I would love for more institutions like that to be able to organize and build community more effectively online. 
So there are lots of just different tools that I think that if we provide, spanning messaging, spanning video chat, these organizations' own websites and other things that they do that if we can help in a lot of those areas, then we can make it so that groups on Facebook are not just a feed and a place where you post some content and maybe engage on a post, but that we can really help more organizations build up community institutions like that. And I think that, that could be a very big contribution and something that I'm excited about taking on."

So small businesses are very reliant on personalized ads, the ability to use data in a very privacy-safe way to get the customers who are interested in their products and services. And that makes sense. Big businesses, we can buy an ad to the whole country. We can buy an ad to a whole region. Small businesses can't. They have to find the precise audiences they want. And I think one of the mainstays of our business is we've enabled that targeting in a very privacy-safe way without giving information without permission to advertisers.
And what's happening with IDFA is that small businesses are really concerned because they're worried that they're not going to be able to buy effective advertising. If all personalized ads went away, small businesses would see a 60% cut in website sales. Now we don't think Apple's contemplating going that far that quickly, but that is the general direction of what would happen. And you can see that, that would be very detrimental to their business. It's also very detrimental to economic growth because so much of our job growth comes from small businesses.
I think it's worth noting it's not just about advertisers. Some of these changes also impact developers and other forms of businesses. We are starting to hear from creators and developers who are worried that some of their free services will have to start charging or shut down, force them into subscriptions or other in-payments for revenue. Now not all small businesses are aware of these challenges, but we are hearing from more and more of them. So we're very concerned."

And in the meantime, we're focused on what we can do to help there. 
Now turning to the results. This was another strong quarter. More than 2.7 billion people now use 1 or more of our apps each day, and more than 200 million businesses use our tools to reach customers. And this has been an intense year, and I am proud that we continue to deliver value for people and businesses around the world. Now over the past couple of quarters, our business has been performing better than we expected. And this has given us the confidence to increase our investments meaningfully and in a few key areas that have the potential to change the trajectory of the company over the long term. So on today's call, I'm going to talk about the opportunities that we're pursuing in augmented and virtual reality and around commerce, business messaging and creators. 
So first, let's talk about building the next computing platform. Now I believe that augmented and virtual reality are going to enable a deeper sense of presence in social connection than any existing platform. They're going to be an important part of how we will interact with computers in the future. So we're going to keep investing heavily in building out the best experience this year, and this accounts for a major part of our overall R&D budget growth. 
Quest 2 is doing better than we expected, even after the holiday season. We continue to see good engagement, and we keep shipping updates that make Quest better and better, including Airlink which enables wireless streaming of games and content from PCs and support for 120 hertz refresh rates. 
Now achieving Quest's high-quality in a wireless form factor has been a major breakthrough. Having wires wrapped around you just really breaks the sense of presence in immersion. And the technology to deliver a great experience wirelessly is very advanced, and most companies aren't going to be able to deliver this. But we believe that it is the minimum bar for a high quality experience. 
This quarter, we also shared more about our future investments, including neural interfaces for interacting with AR and we started testing our new avatar system, which will be a key part of how people express themselves and connect. One interesting trend is that we're seeing the app ecosystem broaden out beyond games into other categories as well. The most used apps are social, which fits our original theory for why we wanted to build this platform in the first place. We're also seeing productivity and even fitness apps. So for example, we launched a tool, so people can subscribe to services like fit XR to do boxing and dancing in VR, just like they would for biking on Peloton. We introduced App Lab, so developers can ship early versions of their apps directly to consumers without having to go through the Oculus store. And between App Lab and streaming from PCs, we're pioneering a much more open model of App store than what's currently available on phones today. 
Now over time, I expect augmented and virtual reality to unlock a massive amount of value, both in people's lives and the economy overall. There's still a long way to go here, and most of our investments to make this work are ahead of us. But I think that the feedback that we're getting from our products is giving us more confidence that our prediction for the future here will happen and that we're focusing on the right areas. 
Now beyond AR and VR, I want to call out some of the other long-term opportunities that we're really focused on, especially in commerce and business messaging. Commerce has been growing in our services for a while, but it has become a lot more important as the pandemic has accelerated a broader shift towards businesses moving online. 
In the last year, we've seen online storefronts stay open, even when physical stores closed. And going forward, online commerce will continue to offer an increasingly personalized and convenient experience. Commerce ads continue to do very well and drive a meaningful amount of our overall business. We built Marketplace into one of the world's leading services for people to buy and sell. And I am pleased to share today that more than 1 billion people visit Marketplace each month. And now  
[Audio Gap]
monthly active shops and over 250 million monthly shops and visitors. We are also focused on building more native commerce tools across our apps. We recently updated WhatsApp catalog. So businesses can keep them updated from their computers and to include what's in stock. We launched Carts on WhatsApp last year and people have used them to send orders more than 5 million times. We're also building a broader infrastructure to support commerce, everything from payments to customer service and support. And WhatsApp Payments is now live in India, and we have gotten approval in Brazil to launch shortly, too. 
We're starting to see a meaningful shift in the way that people communicate with businesses. For a lot of people, online commerce is less about websites and shops and more about messaging. So people want to get support and make purchases right from a chat. Smaller businesses want to show their products and take orders via messages, and larger businesses want reliable and secure infrastructure to communicate with their customers. Businesses using the WhatsApp business API are already sending more than 100 million messages per day. Over the last year, during the height of COVID, total daily conversations between people and businesses on Messenger and Instagram grew by more than 40%. More than 3 million advertisers are already using click-to-message ads to direct people to Messenger. And since we introduced click-to-WhatsApp adds, nearly 1 million advertisers have already started using them, too. And now the next step here is we're going to make it possible to create those click-to-WhatsApp ads from -- directly within the WhatsApp business app. 
The next step is to make it easier for businesses to adopt all these services and to give them the tools that can handle messages and customer relationships. Our acquisition of customer is going through regulatory approvals, and we're looking forward to offering businesses a native way to manage their customer relationships on our platform. 
Now I want to be clear that we have a long way to go to build out a full-featured commerce platform across our services. And this is a multiyear journey, but I am very committed to getting there. This modern commerce system is going to bring together a number of areas where we either already have strong offerings like in ads, community tools and messaging, with areas like shops and business messaging and payments that we are focused on ramping up now. 
As part of this, we're also investing more in building out better customer support for our products. For the last several years, we focused a lot on content moderation and privacy work. And I view customer support as the next pillar of the trust and safety work for our services. 
The last area that I want to discuss today is around creators. I think that a positive vision for the future of the economy is one where more people get to do creative work that they enjoy rather than jobs that they don't. And to get there, we need to build out the creative and monetization tools to support this creator economy. People create an incredibly diverse set of content across our services from long-form writing to live conversations to documentaries and augmented reality filters. And our goal is to support the full range of human expression and to be the best platform for millions of creators to make a living. Now part of this is going to be delivering a suite of tools and products that span all the ways that people want to create and consume content. I believe that the intersection of every media type and every audience size, there is a compelling experience to build. For example, I recently discussed our audio road map and we already support audio calls for private audio communication, but now we're also building out live audio rooms, which we think will be especially useful for groups and communities. We're building sound bites for sharing and consume short-form audio clips broadly, and we are supporting podcasts for sharing and listening to long-form audio. And we're also partnering with Spotify to launch a music player in the Facebook app. 
So we also need to connect these experiences with easy options for monetization, whether that's subscriptions, tipping or enabling creators to give product recommendations and enable commerce. And with Instagram and Facebook, we have a unique ability to bring creators and commerce together, and we will share more on that later this year. 
Now together, these efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform, are a few of the big areas that we were doubling down on going forward. And in each of these, there is a unique opportunity to help people connect in deeper ways and to support a stronger economy for everyone. I'm optimistic that our work in all of these areas will help accelerate some of the positive emerging trends that we are seeing in the world. 
And now I'm going to hand it over to Sheryl."

Our total revenue for Q1 was $26.2 billion, which is a 48% year-over-year increase. We've seen good growth in all regions, and we continue to see strong results in verticals that have performed well during the pandemic, like e-commerce, retail and CPG. Our performance has been driven, in large part, by the continued digital transformation as more and more businesses shift online. For years, we've invested in products and tools to support this shift. And these investments have helped many businesses reinvent themselves during the pandemic. 
One of the best parts of my job is I get to meet SMB owners and hear what's on their minds. Many of them tell me how they've used Facebook to adapt and grow. At a virtual roundtable with SMBs from Detroit this quarter, I spoke to [ La Aysa ] Johnson, who runs an all-natural skin care company called [ Elle Jae ] Essentials. When COVID hit and she had to close her store, she started a Facebook group called The Garden, which now has more than 1,000 members. They give her product ideas, and when she makes the projects they suggest as she says it, they sell quicker than she can keep them on the shelves. By pivoting online, she's been able to replace all of the income she lost from her store. 
I also spoke to Ido Raas, who runs a Yoga studio in nearby Ann Arbor. She started doing outdoor classes during the pandemic and needed to get the word out. She couldn't afford to advertise to everyone in the city, and not everyone in the city wants to do yoga so she uses personalized ads. This enables her to advertise to people in the area who are interested in yoga or meditation. It's all done in a privacy protected way. We show her ad to those people, and we don't share their information with her, and then they sign up for her classes. 
Like everyone else, the business owners I talk to want to know what will happen next. Many are all in online. So even when things fully reopen, they want to be able to do more in line than they did before. So understandably, they're asking us what we can do to help them, not just now, but over the long run. Part of the answer is continuing to improve our tools and products and creating new ones to suit their needs. And part of it is helping them navigate the headwinds that are coming down the line, whether it's the iOS 14 changes or potential regulations. 
On the first part, tools and products. We are all into. From day 1 of COVID, we fast-tracked our work to help people buy and sell online. Initially, we focused on getting the experience right for sellers. As Mark said, we launched shops nearly a year ago. We've continued to develop new features to help personalize the shopping experience and worked with partners to make transactions as seamless as possible. And we've created new formats like live shopping, which bring to life the unique commerce experiences our platforms can offer. 
Now we're equally focused on getting the experience right for consumers. We're rolling out the Shop tab in more countries and exploring new immersive formats like product tags and drop stickers that enable more people to shop with creators and brands they love. We're also constantly developing and improving our ad products to help businesses reach people where they are and get the best possible return on investment. We continue to see strong growth in Stories ads and video ads, which we've invested in heavily. We've also seen strong growth across ads in Facebook Watch, which now has more than 1.25 billion people visiting every month. As the number of people watching video grows, we're developing more opportunities for businesses and creators to reach them. We're expanding paid online events to more countries. We're enabling more people to run in stream ads, including in live videos. And we're developing ads in short-form videos, where we're testing the ability for content creators to monetize their Facebook Stories with ads that look like stickers. 
On the second part, headwinds. Yes, there are challenges coming to personalized advertising, and we've been pretty open about that. We're doing a huge amount of work to prepare. We're working with our customers to implement Apple's API and our own aggregated events measurement API to mitigate the impact of the iOS 14 changes. We're rebuilding meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system continues to perform when we have access to less data in the future. And we're part of long-term collaborations with industry bodies like the W3C on initiatives like privacy enhancing technologies that provide personalized experiences while limiting access to people's information. 
It's also on us to keep making the case that personalized advertising is good for people and businesses and to better explain how it works so that people realize that personalized ads are privacy protected. Small businesses don't have to understand the alphabet soup of acronyms they'll need to comply with, but they do need to have confidence that they can still use our tools to reach the people who want to buy what they're selling in a privacy-safe way. We're confident they can and that they can continue to get great results as digital advertising evolves. 
With the rollout of vaccines, there's reason to be hopeful. But the pandemic is still causing real heartbreak and hardship for people in many countries. And in particular, like Mark, my thoughts are with our friends and colleagues in India and Brazil right now. If the last year has taught us anything, it's to not make assumptions and to not expect things to get better for everyone at the same time. Whatever happens, we'll continue to keep people connected, support the public health response and invest in ways to support businesses now and in the long term. 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses who work with us, big and small, who we learn from every day, and to our incredible teams who have supported millions of businesses through this turbulent time and set them up for success now and in the future. Now over to Dave."

Q1 was a strong quarter for our business, driven by sustained growth in the digital economy and our continued success in helping businesses engage with consumers across our services. Let's begin with our com",1145,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for our business, driven by sustained growth in the digital economy and our continued success in helping businesses engage with consumers across our services. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approximately 2.7 billion people used at least 1 of our services on a daily basis in March and that approximately 3.4 billion people used at least 1 on a monthly basis. Note that these Q1 family metrics reflect new data from recent user surveys. Further details on our family metrics are included in the earnings slides on our IR website. 
Our global community continued to grow, even as we lapped elevated user growth in the first quarter of last year related to the pandemic. Facebook daily active users reached 1.88 billion, up 8% or 144 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.85 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew by 250 million or 10% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $26.2 billion, up 48% or 44% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind. And had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been $706 million lower. Q1 ad revenue was $25.4 billion, up 46% or 42% on a constant currency basis. The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by continued strength in product verticals such as online commerce. Growth was broad-based across all advertiser sizes, with particular strength from small and medium-sized advertisers. Our year-over-year ad revenue growth also benefited from lapping pandemic-related demand headwinds experienced during March of last year. 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions. Growth was strongest in Europe at 53%. Rest of World Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada grew 47%, 46% and 42%, respectively. Europe and Asia Pacific benefited from currency tailwinds, while Rest of World continue to face currency headwinds. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 12%, and the average price per ad increased 30%. Impression growth was driven by both Instagram and Facebook. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by lapping depressed pricing levels from 1 year ago as well as strong advertiser demand. 
Other revenue was $732 million, up 146%, driven by continued strong Quest 2 sales. We've been encouraged by the sustained strength we're seeing with sales of Quest 2 since its October launch. 
Turning now to expenses. Q1 total expenses were $14.8 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 48%, driven mostly by core infrastructure investments, hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales and payments to partners. R&D increased 29%, driven mostly by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 2% with growth in hiring, partially offset by lower marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 2%, with growth in employee-related costs, partially offset by lapping higher bad debt expenses related to COVID in the first quarter of last year. 
We added over 2,000 net new hires in Q1, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 60,600 full-time employees, up 26% compared to last year. 
First quarter operating income was $11.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $9.5 billion or $3.30 per share. Capital expenditures, including capital leases, were $4.4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $7.8 billion. We repurchased $4.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with $64.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
In terms of sustainability, I'm pleased to report that Facebook's global operations have now reached net zero emissions and are 100% supported by renewable energy. This is an important milestone for our business, but we also recognize there's more work to do in the years ahead, and we remain committed to our next goal of decarbonizing our entire value chain in 2030. Additional information on our ongoing efforts across environmental, social and governance areas can be found in our recently filed proxy statement. 
Turning now to the outlook. We are pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021, which was driven by a 30% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad and a 12% increase in the number of ads delivered. We expect that advertising revenue growth will continue to be primarily driven by price during the rest of 2021. We expect second quarter 2021 year-over-year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly accelerate relative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021 as we lap slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to significantly decelerate sequentially as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recently launched iOS 14.5 update, which we expect to begin having an impact in the second quarter. This is factored into our outlook. There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments, and like companies across a wide range of industries, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress. 
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $68 billion to $73 billion. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure and consumer-related costs. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth, and our expense outlook reflects the underlying strength of our business and the compelling investment opportunities we see across our products, including consumer hardware. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, down from our prior estimate of $21 billion to $23 billion. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. 
Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. 
In closing, the pandemic during the past year has presented some incredible challenges to our global community. During this time, we have worked to help both businesses and consumers stay connected. We remain focused on helping people and businesses navigate the transition out of the pandemic as more regions reopen. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

And then as you sort of look into the back half into '22, what are the biggest areas of innovation that you're really focused on to continue to grow that number? Maybe talk about nonadvertising monetization optionality. 
And the second one I had is around as we -- I know it's early in the reopening, but would be curious just to hear about what you're seeing from an engagement or time spent perspective of your user base in the areas of the world that are a little more reopened and how you're thinking about that in the back half?"

People really discover lots of products through our Feed and ad Stories, through our Feed and Stories ads. It's been our largest ad vertical. COVID really accelerated it, but it's been one of the fastest-growing verticals we've had over the last 5 years, and we believe that Facebook drives hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce GMV today through our ads business. 
So we've certainly made a ton of progress there. And our goals going forward are, we want to continue to be the very best place to advertise. We're going to have to do work to do that, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we can still use data in a privacy-safe way, get the right ads to the right person at the right time, but we think we are market leaders here. 
The other work we're doing, and Mark talked about it in his remarks and I did as well, is to make it easier to sell on our platform. Now the shopping experience is really well-defined in other places, and we are later to that than we were to adds. So we know we have a lot of work to do. We're working with partners to build some of the parts of the experience that we're not as expert in, and we're integrating -- and we're integrating products like shops. We have more than 1 million active shops and more than 250 million people interacting with merchandise per month so we've made some good progress. But we recognize that getting to a really seamless transaction experience is going to take work on our side, and we're going to continue to invest there. 
I think another area where we do have to do more is we have to improve the consumer experience to help people transact on the platform. We've done, I think, more work on the business side, on the integration side. And now we are focused on continuing to build that and continuing to build out the consumer experience. For the foreseeable future, as are going to be the vast majority of our revenue in this area and that commerce vertical is so important to us, we don't need commerce itself or fees [indiscernible] on a big part of what happens in order to make the investment worthwhile, but we really have to focus on helping more businesses move online and have a great experience on our platform. And that, along with that, makes this a very worthwhile investment for us."

So I think broadly, what we're seeing is just engagement trends that are going back to a more normalized level. So if you think about the past year, it's been pretty noisy because of COVID, in the first quarter of 2020, we saw a significant increase in engagement as a result of the pandemic, and we've seen some of those trends subside as the year progressed and we saw gradual phase down of lockdowns. I don't think anything hugely dramatic, but it's certainly something that we're seeing in the engagement trends. And that's one of the factors that's playing into price being a bigger driver of growth on the revenue side because of the impression growth being lower. And I'd say, COVID is certainly a factor in that. 
On the revenue front, I think, there, we're seeing continued strong demand with products and even -- and then we're seeing services spend come back. So I think that's kind of a quick landscape of what we're seeing with the COVID impacts."

And then the second question, maybe to Dave, any surprises with the iOS 14-5 (sic) [ 14.5 ] update? And any comments on what you've seen with users who have already opted out of tracking before this update?"

So yes, on the impression growth front, I think we're seeing a couple of factors. We talked about the COVID impact and the return to more normal levels, and that's affecting some of the impression growth. 
The second factor that we're seeing, and it kind of gets at some of your question, which is we're seeing really strong engagement on video, particularly internationally. And that's -- we're pleased with that. I'd point to a couple of examples there. I'd say Facebook Watch, we talked about the 1.25 billion users. Also, Reels is starting to get traction on -- and doing well on Instagram. Now video currently has relatively fewer impressions on a time spent basis. So that's playing into the engagement trends as well. 
And then finally, I would say, we are seeing competition in News Feed from both our own video products and also other products as well. So that's factoring into it. 
And then your second question was regarding any surprises with iOS 14.5. Look, I think it's really early. They just began rolling out the update. So it's sort of very, very low kind of penetration rates of the new OS at this point. But a couple of things I'd say. We continue to be concerned about the impact that this update is going to have on the ability of small businesses to use their advertising budgets effectively. That said, the impact on our own business, we think, will be manageable. We continue to expect it will be a headwind for the remainder of the year, but we're making encouraging progress, as Sheryl mentioned, on our own solutions to help advertisers navigate these changes. And that includes helping advertisers work with the Apple API as well as our own approach to using aggregated data for targeting and measurement that we call Aggregated Events Management. So the goal there is really to maintain it in the long run, even improve performance with less data. So -- and then I'd also add that just in addition to these mitigations, we're also just seeing very strong overall ad demand, which is contributing to a more positive outlook for 2021. And I would say, just overall, the impact of these -- the specific iOS 14 changes are 1 element of some of the challenges with Apple. But we think the impact of the Apple approach is really much bigger than this particular update around third-party data usage. Apple has a number of private APIs on hardware and software that advantage their own products and services in ways that are challenging, and we face that issue with -- in places like our messaging products and even with the hardware products we're launching. So we generally don't think that this closed approach is the best one for the industry from an innovation perspective."

So augmented and virtual reality, I have thought about for a long time because I think that it's sort of the holy",541,"Sure. I can talk about that. I think we mostly think about these things from the perspective of improving the experiences that we can build. So augmented and virtual reality, I have thought about for a long time because I think that it's sort of the holy grail of delivering a sense of presence and the type of social experiences that you would want to build. So right now, and I guess for the whole history of the company, we've been constrained to a web browser. And now, in some cases, this increasingly restrictive mobile app rules. But I think that this future environment where you're going to be able to feel like you're really present with someone else, that's going to be really powerful. And it's going to unlock a bunch of experiences that we wanted to build for a long time, and that's what I'm really excited about. 
Similarly, on the commerce side, I mean part of this is motivated by wanting to help out small businesses and different businesses sell more across our platform. And a lot of it is also just about making the consumer experience better, right? So right now, a lot of times, you'll click on an ad, you'll see an interesting ad, and it'll take you to a website, and the website won't necessarily have full context on who you are, the payment experience will be clunky in doing that. And there's just an opportunity, I think, to make that all a lot more seamless. And when it is seamless, it bolsters a better experience for the people using it, but then it also converts better for the businesses and performs better. So I think the way we're going to approach this is largely from starting with having built out this very robust ad system and then just basically working our way down the experience from there. So making it so businesses and creators can have shops and -- but the ads can then link into shops and have a native shopping experience. And then over time, we will also increasingly, as our payment systems get better and better and more people have credentials on file, I would imagine that -- that going all the way through the funnel will become an increasing part of what people do, and that will both be a better experience for consumers and convert better for businesses. 
Similar story on the creator side here. Our main goal is not necessarily that the creator economy is a major business by itself. But if we become the best place for creators to make a living, then I think that's going to mean that there's better content across the services and better opportunities for community building and engaging people, and that's what we care about. But of course, if there's more engagement and if creators are finding that there are good opportunities to monetize, then they'll engage more with our business products, too, and there will be some opportunity there. 
But -- so I kind of think about all this stuff from the perspective of improving the products. And I think that, that's going to lead to a lot of benefits for all of the stakeholders over the next several years."

Our belief is that if we build a product that is more valuable, then people will engage more, but you should start by trying to build something that's more valuable, not by trying to increase the time that people are spending. 
So we've done that for years, and I think it's yielded good results. So from that perspective, I know that what you're saying is something that -- that some folks like to throw around and say. But I actually think that the more that different regulators or other folks dig into this, I actually think that our practices here are quite robust. And we don't want extreme -- extremist content or any of that stuff on our services. So if anything, to the contrary of trying to promote that, we go out of our way to try to reduce that. And I think that, that -- contrary to what a lot of these other folks say is it is actually in our business interest to reduce it because people don't like it, right? I mean, consumers don't like it. Advertisers don't want to be near it. So I don't actually think that this kind of narrative about the company is accurate. And we've tried hard to dispel it. I don't think we've been super successful of that. We will continue trying to work on that. But just to kind of be clear about how I see things, that's the basic download. 
I think News Feed is still a huge part of the products and the home feed in Instagram. But increasingly, Stories is a big deal in Instagram, a lot of people are using Explore and IGTV. Video and Watch on Facebook are quite big. And as you say, a lot of people spend a lot of their time and attention in messaging apps and private interfaces like that as well. So I think there are a lot of different things that people are doing across the services. But Wehner can jump in with any more color on that, that he wants to add."

In terms of what changed, I think the big piece here is that Quest 2 is doing quite well. I don't want to overstate it because I think compared to platforms that are kind of large, massive successes today, it's still, obviously, on the small end. But there's been a very real inflection in terms of adoption and engagement that we're seeing with Quest 2. It feels like there's something about the quality bar that we hit and the price that we hit and the fact that we're able to do that in a wireless form factor. But I think it's just -- first of all, it's going to be really hard for anyone else, I think, to meet those different attributes. Some other folks might try to ship something that the claim is higher quality but has a wire. And I just don't think that consumers are going to want to go for that. So we'll see how all of that plays out. 
But I also just look at how the team is executing and the products that we have in the pipeline. And I want to make sure that we can really go all in and deliver this. But I do admit Quest 2 has been a meaningful step up from Quest 1 in terms of the progress that we're seeing. 
And content is definitely a part of this. And we have a team internally that's focused on both first party, I guess it's all first-party, second-party and third-party content and making partnerships with studios. And that certainly is a big part of this. I think Quest has, I think, by far, the best lineup of VR content. And I think the road map of what's ahead is even more exciting, some of the stuff that's coming over the next few years."

In terms of when these platforms will be more adopted, I think a lot of it is about form factor and use cases. I mean Quest 2, I think, is -- we kind of hit a key point, but I think there's still further that we want to go on the form factor of that. But I think the wireless part is key. So I'll just say that again. So I think that there's a lot that you can do in terms of getting products that might have better graphics or something. But with a wire, it really hurts the sense of immersion because you don't want to have like a wire wrapped around your neck while you're doing all this stuff. 
But the other big piece is the use cases, which is why I called out in my remarks in the beginning that one of the promising signs that we're seeing is that it is expanding out beyond games. Now it's still primarily games. But when we started on this journey, a lot of the reason why I said that I thought it made sense for us to invest in this is because I expect virtual and augmented reality to be some of the most social platforms that get built. And the fact that a number of the most engaging experiences on the platforms today are social and a lot of the top games are social, I think, is really promising. But also seeing things in terms of productivity and like I mentioned, is just really promising that you're seeing the early signs of this becoming a broader platform. So there's -- again, I don't overstate any of this because it's all quite early still, and all these things need to develop out, but those are very promising signs from my perspective. And as those keep on developing out, then I think the platforms will be broadly applicable to more people. 
And then the other thing I'd say is that we haven't really even gotten there on AR yet, right? I think virtual reality, the form factor constraints, I think, are a little less than what you're going to have an augmented reality, where in virtual reality, I think you need to get to a high-quality wireless experience. In augmented reality, you're going to really need a pair of glasses that look like normal looking glasses in order for that to hit a mainstream acceptance. And that, I think, is going to be one of the hardest technical challenges of the decade, it's basically fitting a supercomputer in the frame of glasses. So I'm -- I find not a very exciting problem to work on. And I think that once that's achievable, the potential on that is going to be quite big."

Just on the Q1 total expenses, I called out some of the items in my comments. But I think you've got a couple of factors. One was marketing spend was relatively lower compared to Q1 of last year where the growth was lower. And then also, we had a bad debt expense that, I think, was not unique for Facebook. I think you see this in some other companies as well that we took in Q1 of last year related to our expectations on collectibility around COVID. So that's factoring into some of the compares on the growth rates as well. 
And then as you look at the remainder of the year, a couple of things. One is the strength of the business, in general, is giving us confidence, and we're looking for areas to invest more. So we're continuing to invest in research and development across the priorities that Mark outlined in his comments. And then as well, we'll see a pickup in things like marketing in the remainder of the year. So that's what's driving the acceleration of expense growth as you look forward. 
And then the COVID compares are a little bit, there's just different expense lines that COVID impact. So it's a little noisy from that as well."

First, Sheryl, in the past, you've talked about advertising being kind of a relative ROI gain. So when you think about the shift from iOS changes, perhaps going from like an operational short-term headwind to potentially a tailwind as other outlets for advertising lose ROI on a relative basis, like is that something that happens in months, in quarters, in a year? Like talk about how you see that potentially evolving? 
And then second one, Sheryl, you also talked about starting to invest more in building out the consumer experience on the shopping side. So maybe you can just walk us through some of the things you think Facebook can uniquely bring into e-commerce that might make for a newer, better user experience? Is that AR/VR? Is that -- what are some of the things that could really make Facebook stand out for consumers on e-commerce?"

On the first, the relative ROI, you're exactly right. People are going to advertise. They're going to advertise on TV, on radio, on billboards, on different online platforms, and they're looking for relative ROI. That means a signal goes down and it goes down everywhere, we're competing differently. Our goal is to make sure that we can still do personalized ads. We do think that our relative competitive advantage has been that our ads are more personalized. And that's really important because as in some of the examples I shared, most small businesses, the yoga studio in Detroit can't afford to advertise to everyone in Detroit, much less everyone in Michigan, much less everyone in the U.S. And so advertising using -- who lives there and who's likely to be interested in yoga and meditation is really important. 
We believe we will still be relatively better positioned. Virtual -- Phase 2, not all players, right, because we're not running the platforms, but based on many, we're still going to do better at that than a lot of digital players. We're still going to do better at that than TV or radio. But when signal goes down, we're going to have to rebuild that capability, and that's what I talked about. 
In terms of the timing you asked specifically, we really don't know. The iOS 14 changes are really new. Regulatory changes that might happen at a state level or a global or a regional level or a national level haven't happened yet. So we'll have to see. And I don't have a real sense of what those changes will be, what their impact will be right now. And -- but we are very focused on competing for those ad dollars and doing it as well as we can. 
In the consumer experience on the shopping side, where we are right now is we launched the shop -- a lot of the shopping tools, and we've had broad business adoption, and that's been good. We don't offer the full suite of tools that a lot of other places do. But more and more, we have shops functionality that people are adopting. We really need to work on the consumer side of the experience. 
I do think we have a unique opportunity there. You asked again, like what is our -- I think -- is my language at yours, but I think you were asking like what is our sustainable competitive advantage here. We have a lot of people doing a lot of activity. We increasingly have people looking for products. We increasingly have people finding products. And so we've always been strong at the top of the funnel. Can we move people down the funnel? We think we can. But that's going to take work, and it's also going to take some time for people to get used to that. 
But in terms of the long-run competitive advantage, we have a lot of people looking for a lot of things, sharing a lot of things and continuing to find things they really like. And so I'm very optimistic about our opportunity here, but it's going to take real work."

I think right now, I think the trajectory of this is that when you are very early on in the platform, it's helpful to centralize a bunch of that development close together in the organization. But then as things start to build out and you want to get the full energy of the different app teams involved in building for this, then you want to decentralize it more. So -- so right now, it's still more on the centralized side. But I'd say that over the next year or 2, we're certainly going to generate more of that work out across the company and have more of the work that we do be building towards these different platforms. 
And to your point on the other kinds of services that are important for commerce, payments, both things like Facebook Pay and eventually, hopefully, we'll be launching Novi and -- sorry, Diem soon, that, I think, is going to be a pretty big thing, too. And that's very important for all the reasons that you're saying. Commerce, across all these platforms, is going to be very important. And certainly in a platform that we're building like this, we want to enable payments very easily to make it to that -- the economics all work out for developers."

And then Dave, on pricing in the auction, I know that it's up because of the easy comparison last year. If you look at pricing on a 2-year stack, it's actually up nicely.

But when it comes to helping people reach the largest audience or finding their specific audience, I think we are world-class at that. I think we're the best of that. And then in terms of monetization, I also think that as our business results show, we are very efficient at that. And if we can put that to work for creators to help them make money from their work, then that can help achieve this goal of enabling millions of people to make a living through this kind of creative work.

But we're starting to see, I think, some signs of life there in some other verticals that were negatively impacted by COVID. But the -- but the really just strong across-the-board demand for ads has been what's driven it for us. 
I think the 2-year compare that you talked about is a helpful compare because there's a lot of noise in our year-over-year revenue growth rates when you look just at 2020 compared to 2021. And if you do sort of a 2-year compare, I think -- and looked at the year-over-year growth rates by quarter, I think we'd expect a more normalized rate of deceleration of growth, not -- not just all of the bouncing around from the weak quarters that we're going to have and then I think correspondingly stronger quarters as the year progresses from a compare basis into 2020.

More than 2.7 billion people now use 1 or more of our apps each day, and more than 200 million businesses use our tools to reach customers. And this has been an intense year, and I am proud that we continue to deliver value for people and businesses around the world. 
Now over the past couple of quarters, our business has been performing better than we expected. And this has given us the confidence to increase our investments meaningfully and in a few key areas that have the potential to change the trajectory of the company over the long term. So on today's call, I'm going to talk about the opportunities that we're pursuing in augmented and virtual reality and around commerce, business messaging and creators.  
So first, let's talk about building the next computing platform. Now I believe that augmented and virtual reality are going to enable a deeper sense of presence in social connection than any existing platform. They're going to be an important part of how we will interact with computers in the future. So we're going to keep investing heavily in building out the best experience this year, and this accounts for a major part of our overall R&D budget growth.  
Quest 2 is doing better than we expected, even after the holiday season. We continue to see good engagement, and we keep shipping updates that make Quest better and better, including Air Link, which enables wireless streaming of games and content from PCs and support for 120 hertz refresh rates.  
Now achieving Quest's high quality in a wireless form factor has been a major breakthrough. Having wires wrapped around you just really breaks the sense of presence in immersion. And the technology to deliver a great experience wirelessly is very advanced, and most companies aren't going to be able to deliver this. But we believe that it is the minimum bar for a high-quality experience.  
This quarter, we also shared more about our future investments, including neural interfaces for interacting with AR. And we started testing our new avatar system, which will be a key part of how people express themselves and connect. One interesting trend is that we're seeing the app ecosystem broaden out beyond games into other categories as well. The most used apps are social, which fits our original theory for why we wanted to build this platform in the first place. We're also seeing productivity and even fitness apps. So for example, we launched a tool so people can subscribe to services like FitXR to do boxing and dancing in VR, just like they would for biking on Peloton. We introduced App Lab so developers can ship early versions of their apps directly to consumers without having to go through the Oculus store. And between App Lab and streaming from PCs, we're pioneering a much more open model of app store than what's currently available on phones today.  
Now over time, I expect augmented and virtual reality to unlock a massive amount of value, both in people's lives and the economy overall. There's still a long way to go here, and most of our investments to make this work are ahead of us. But I think that the feedback that we're getting from our products is giving us more confidence that our prediction for the future here will happen and that we're focusing on the right areas.  
Now beyond AR and VR, I want to call out some of the other long-term opportunities that we're really focused on, especially in commerce and business messaging. Commerce has been growing in our services for a while, but it has become a lot more important as the pandemic has accelerated a broader shift towards businesses moving online.  
In the last year, we've seen online storefronts stay open, even when physical stores closed. And going forward, online commerce will continue to offer an increasingly personalized and convenient experience. Commerce ads continue to do very well and drive a meaningful amount of our overall business. We built Marketplace into one of the world's leading services for people to buy and sell. And I am pleased to share today that more than 1 billion people visit Marketplace each month. And now we're investing in building for the future of commerce, so we launched Shops last year. And as I recently shared, there are now more than 1 million monthly active shops and over 250 million monthly shops and visitors. 
We are also focused on building more native commerce tools across our apps. We recently updated WhatsApp catalog, so businesses can keep them updated from their computers and to include what's in stock. We launched carts on WhatsApp last year, and people have used them to send orders more than 5 million times.  
We're also building a broader infrastructure to support commerce, everything from payments to customer service and support. And WhatsApp Payments is now live in India, and we have gotten approval in Brazil to launch shortly, too.  
We're starting to see a meaningful shift in the way that people communicate with businesses. For a lot of people, online commerce is less about websites and shops and more about messaging. So people want to get support and make purchases right from a chat. Smaller businesses want to show their products and take orders via messages, and larger businesses want reliable and secure infrastructure to communicate with their customers. 
Businesses using the WhatsApp business API are already sending more than 100 million messages per day. Over the last year, during the height of COVID, total daily conversations between people and businesses on Messenger and Instagram grew by more than 40%. More than 3 million advertisers are already using click-to-message ads to direct people to Messenger. And since we introduced click-to-WhatsApp ads, nearly 1 million advertisers have already started using them, too. And now the next step here is we're going to make it possible to create those click-to-WhatsApp ads from -- directly within the WhatsApp business app. 
The next step is to make it easier for businesses to adopt all these services and to give them the tools that can handle messages and customer relationships. Our acquisition of customer is going through regulatory approvals, and we're looking forward to offering businesses a native way to manage their customer relationships on our platform. 
Now I want to be clear that we have a long way to go to build out a full-featured commerce platform across our services. And this is a multiyear journey, but I am very committed to getting there. This modern commerce system is going to bring together a number of areas where we either already have strong offerings like in ads, community tools and messaging, with areas like shops and business messaging and payments that we are focused on ramping up now. 
As part of this, we're also investing more in building out better customer support for our products. For the last several years, we focused a lot on content moderation and privacy work. And I view customer support as the next pillar of the trust and safety work for our services. 
The last area that I want to discuss today is around creators. I think that a positive vision for the future of the economy is one where more people get to do creative work that they enjoy rather than jobs that they don't. And to get there, we need to build out the creative and monetization tools to support this creator economy. 
People create an incredibly diverse set of content across our services from long-form writing to live conversations to documentaries and augmented reality filters. And our goal is to support the full range of human expression and to be the best platform for millions of creators to make a living. Now part of this is going to be delivering a suite of tools and products that span all of the ways that people want to create and consume content. 
I believe that the intersection of every media type and every audience size, there is a compelling experience to build. For example, I recently discussed our audio road map. And we already support audio calls for private audio communication, but now we're also building out live audio rooms, which we think will be especially useful for groups and communities. We're building sound bites for sharing and consuming short-form audio clips broadly, and we are supporting podcasts for sharing and listening to long-form audio. And we're also partnering with Spotify to launch a music player in the Facebook app. 
So we also need to connect these experiences with easy options for monetization, whether that's subscriptions, tipping or enabling creators to give product recommendations and enable commerce. And with Instagram and Facebook, we have a unique ability to bring creators and commerce together, and we will share more on that later this year. 
Now together, these efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform are a few of the big areas that we were doubling down on going forward. And in each of these, there is a unique opportunity to help people connect in deeper ways and to support a stronger economy for everyone. I'm optimistic that our work in all of these areas will help accelerate some of the positive emerging trends that we are seeing in the world. 
And now I'm going to hand it over to Sheryl."

Our total revenue for Q1 was $26.2 billion, which is a 48% year-over-year increase. We've seen good growth in all regions, and we continue to see strong results in verticals that have performed well during the pandemic, like e-commerce, retail and CPG. Our performance has been driven, in large part, by the continued digital transformation as more and more businesses shift online. For years, we've invested in products and tools to support this shift. And these investments have helped many businesses reinvent themselves during the pandemic. 
One of the best parts of my job is I get to meet SMB owners and hear what's on their minds. Many of them tell me how they've used Facebook to adapt and grow. At a virtual roundtable with SMBs from Detroit this quarter, I spoke to La'Asia Johnson, who runs an all-natural skin care company called Elle Jae Essentials. When COVID hit and she had to close her store, she started a Facebook group called The Garden, which now has more than 1,000 members. They give her product ideas. And when she makes the projects they suggest, as she says it, they sell quicker than she can keep them on the shelves. By pivoting online, she's been able to replace all of the income she lost from her store. 
I also spoke to Ita Reyes, who runs a yoga studio in nearby Ann Arbor. She started doing outdoor classes during the pandemic and needed to get the word out. She couldn't afford to advertise to everyone in the city, and not everyone in the city wants to do yoga so she uses personalized ads. This enables her to advertise to people in the area who are interested in yoga or meditation. It's all done in a privacy protected way. We show her ad to those people, and we don't share their information with her, and then they sign up for her classes. 
Like everyone else, the business owners I talk to want to know what will happen next. Many are all in online. So even when things fully reopen, they want to be able to do more online than they did before. So understandably, they're asking us what we can do to help them, not just now, but over the long run. Part of the answer is continuing to improve our tools and products and creating new ones to suit their needs. And part of it is helping them navigate the headwinds that are coming down the line, whether it's the iOS 14 changes or potential regulations. 
On the first part, tools and products. We are all in, too. From day 1 of COVID, we fast-tracked our work to help people buy and sell online. Initially, we focused on getting the experience right for sellers. As Mark said, we launched Shops nearly a year ago. We've continued to develop new features to help personalize the shopping experience and worked with partners to make transactions as seamless as possible. And we've created new formats like live shopping, which bring to life the unique commerce experiences our platforms can offer. 
Now we're equally focused on getting the experience right for consumers. We're rolling out the Shop tab in more countries and exploring new immersive formats like product tags and drop stickers that enable more people to shop with creators and brands they love. 
We're also constantly developing and improving our ad products to help businesses reach people where they are and get the best possible return on investment. We continue to see strong growth in Stories ads and video ads, which we've invested in heavily. We've also seen strong growth across ads in Facebook Watch, which now has more than 1.25 billion people visiting every month. As the number of people watching video grows, we're developing more opportunities for businesses and creators to reach them. 
We're expanding paid online events to more countries. We're enabling more people to run in stream ads, including in live videos. And we're developing ads in short-form videos, where we're testing the ability for content creators to monetize their Facebook Stories with ads that look like stickers. 
On the second part, headwinds. Yes, there are challenges coming to personalized advertising, and we've been pretty open about that. We're doing a huge amount of work to prepare. We're working with our customers to implement Apple's API and our own aggregated events measurement API to mitigate the impact of the iOS 14 changes. We're rebuilding meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system continues to perform when we have access to less data in the future. And we're part of long-term collaborations with industry bodies like the W3C on initiatives like privacy enhancing technologies that provide personalized experiences while limiting access to people's information. 
It's also on us to keep making the case that personalized advertising is good for people and businesses and to better explain how it works so that people realize that personalized ads are privacy protected. Small businesses don't have to understand the alphabet soup of acronyms they'll need to comply with, but they do need to have confidence that they can still use our tools to reach the people who want to buy what they're selling in a privacy-safe way. We're confident they can and that they can continue to get great results as digital advertising evolves. 
With the rollout of vaccines, there's reason to be hopeful. But the pandemic is still causing real heartbreak and hardship for people in many countries. And in particular, like Mark, my thoughts are with our friends and colleagues in India and Brazil right now. If the last year has taught us anything, it's to not make assumptions and to not expect things to get better for everyone at the same time. Whatever happens, we'll continue to keep people connected, support the public health response and invest in ways to support businesses now and in the long term. 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses who work with us, big and small, who we learn from every day, and to our incredible teams who have supported millions of businesses through this turbulent time and set them up for success now and in the future. 
Now over to Dave."

Let's begin with our com",1145,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for our business, driven by sustained growth in the digital economy and our continued success in helping businesses engage with consumers across our services. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approximately 2.7 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis in March and that approximately 3.4 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Note that these Q1 family metrics reflect new data from recent user surveys. Further details on our family metrics are included in the earnings slides on our IR website. 
Our global community continued to grow, even as we lapped elevated user growth in the first quarter of last year related to the pandemic. Facebook daily active users reached 1.88 billion, up 8% or 144 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.85 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew by 250 million or 10% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $26.2 billion, up 48% or 44% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind. And had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been $706 million lower. Q1 ad revenue was $25.4 billion, up 46% or 42% on a constant currency basis. 
The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by continued strength in product verticals such as online commerce. Growth was broad-based across all advertiser sizes, with particular strength from small- and medium-sized advertisers. Our year-over-year ad revenue growth also benefited from lapping pandemic-related demand headwinds experienced during March of last year. 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions. Growth was strongest in Europe at 53%. Rest of World, Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada grew 47%, 46% and 42%, respectively. Europe and Asia Pacific benefited from currency tailwinds, while Rest of World continued to face currency headwinds. 
In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 12%, and the average price per ad increased 30%. Impression growth was driven by both Instagram and Facebook. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by lapping depressed pricing levels from 1 year ago as well as strong advertiser demand. 
Other revenue was $732 million, up 146%, driven by continued strong Quest 2 sales. We've been encouraged by the sustained strength we're seeing with sales of Quest 2 since its October launch. 
Turning now to expenses. Q1 total expenses were $14.8 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 48%, driven mostly by core infrastructure investments, hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales and payments to partners. R&D increased 29%, driven mostly by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 2% with growth in hiring partially offset by lower marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 2% with growth in employee-related costs partially offset by lapping higher bad debt expenses related to COVID in the first quarter of last year. 
We added over 2,000 net new hires in Q1, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 60,600 full-time employees, up 26% compared to last year. First quarter operating income was $11.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $9.5 billion or $3.30 per share. Capital expenditures, including capital leases, were $4.4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $7.8 billion. We repurchased $4.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with $64.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
In terms of sustainability, I'm pleased to report that Facebook's global operations have now reached net zero emissions and are 100% supported by renewable energy. This is an important milestone for our business, but we also recognize there's more work to do in the years ahead. And we remain committed to our next goal of decarbonizing our entire value chain in 2030. Additional information on our ongoing efforts across environmental, social and governance areas can be found in our recently filed proxy statement. 
Turning now to the outlook. We are pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021, which was driven by a 30% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad and a 12% increase in the number of ads delivered. We expect that advertising revenue growth will continue to be primarily driven by price during the rest of 2021. 
We expect second quarter 2021 year-over-year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly accelerate relative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021 as we lap slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to significantly decelerate sequentially as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. 
We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recently launched iOS 14.5 update, which we expect to begin having an impact in the second quarter. This is factored into our outlook. 
There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments, and like companies across a wide range of industries, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress. 
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $68 billion to $73 billion. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure and consumer-related costs. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth, and our expense outlook reflects the underlying strength of our business and the compelling investment opportunities we see across our products, including consumer hardware. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, down from our prior estimate of $21 billion to $23 billion. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. 
Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. 
In closing, the pandemic during the past year has presented some incredible challenges to our global community. During this time, we have worked to help both businesses and consumers stay connected. We remain focused on helping people and businesses navigate the transition out of the pandemic as more regions reopen. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

Maybe talk about nonadvertising monetization optionality. 
And the second one I had is around as we -- I know it's early in the reopening, but would be curious just to hear about what you're seeing from an engagement or time spent perspective of your user base in the areas of the world that are a little more reopened and how you're thinking about that in the back half."

People really discover lots of products through our Feed and ad Stories -- through our Feed and Stories ads. It's been our largest ad vertical. COVID really accelerated it, but it's been one of the fastest-growing verticals we've had over the last 5 years. And we believe that Facebook drives hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce GMV today through our ads business. 
So we've certainly made a ton of progress there. And our goals going forward are, we want to continue to be the very best place to advertise. We're going to have to do work to do that, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we can still use data in a privacy-safe way, get the right ads to the right person at the right time, but we think we are market leaders here. 
The other work we're doing, and Mark talked about it in his remarks and I did as well, is to make it easier to sell on our platform. Now the shopping experience is really well-defined in other places, and we are later to that than we were to ads. So we know we have a lot of work to do. We're working with partners to build some of the parts of the experience that we're not as expert in, and we're integrating products like shops. We have more than 1 million active shops and more than 250 million people interacting with merchandise per month. So we've made some good progress. But we recognize that getting to a really seamless transaction experience is going to take work on our side, and we're going to continue to invest there. 
I think another area where we do have to do more is we have to improve the consumer experience to help people transact on the platform. We've done, I think, more work on the business side, on the integration side. And now we are focused on continuing to build that and continuing to build out the consumer experience. 
For the foreseeable future, as are going to be the vast majority of our revenue in this area and that commerce vertical is so important to us, we don't need commerce itself or fees to become a big part of what happens in order to make the investment worthwhile, but we really have to focus on helping more businesses move online and have a great experience on our platform. And that, along with that, makes this a very worthwhile investment for us."

So if you think about the past year, it's been pretty noisy because of COVID. In the first quarter of 2020, we saw a significant increase in engagement as a result of the pandemic. And we've seen some of those trends subside as the year progressed, and we saw gradual phase down of lockdowns. I don't think anything hugely dramatic, but it's certainly something that we're seeing in the engagement trends. And that's one of the factors that's playing into price being a bigger driver of growth on the revenue side because of the impression growth being lower. And I'd say COVID is certainly a factor in that. 
On the revenue front, I think, there, we're seeing continued strong demand with products and even -- and then we're seeing services spend come back. So I think that's kind of a quick landscape of what we're seeing with the COVID impacts."

Could you comment on what you're seeing with overall engagement? And as people use these over -- new platforms, is it growing, time spent and other factors? 
And then the second question, maybe to Dave, any surprises with the iOS 14-5 (sic) [ 14.5 ] update? And any comments on what you've seen with users who have already opted out of tracking before this update?"

So yes, on the impression growth front, I think we're seeing a couple of factors. We talked about the COVID impact and the return to more normal levels, and that's affecting some of the impression growth. 
The second factor that we're seeing, and it kind of gets at some of your question, which is we're seeing really strong engagement on video, particularly internationally. And that's -- we're pleased with that. I'd point to a couple of examples there. I'd say Facebook Watch, we talked about the 1.25 billion users. Also, Reels is starting to get traction on -- and doing well on Instagram. Now video currently has relatively fewer impressions on a time spent basis. So that's playing into the engagement trends as well. 
And then finally, I would say, we are seeing competition in News Feed from both our own video products and also other's products as well. So that's factoring into it. 
And then your second question was regarding any surprises with iOS 14.5. Look, I think it's really early. They just began rolling out the update. So it's sort of very, very low kind of penetration rates of the new OS at this point. 
But a couple of things. I'd say we continue to be concerned about the impact that this update is going to have on the ability of small businesses to use their advertising budgets effectively. That said, the impact on our own business, we think, will be manageable. We continue to expect it will be a headwind for the remainder of the year, but we're making encouraging progress, as Sheryl mentioned, on our own solutions to help advertisers navigate these changes. And that includes helping advertisers work with the Apple API as well as our own approach to using aggregated data for targeting and measurement that we call Aggregated Events Management. So the goal there is really to maintain it in the long run, even improve performance with less data. 
So -- and then I'd also add that just in addition to these mitigations, we're also just seeing very strong overall ad demand, which is contributing to a more positive outlook for 2021. And I would say, just overall, the impact of these -- the specific iOS 14 changes are 1 element of some of the challenges with Apple. But we think the impact of the Apple approach is really much bigger than this particular update around third-party data usage. Apple has a number of private APIs on hardware and software that advantage their own products and services in ways that are challenging, and we face that issue with -- in places like our messaging products and even with the hardware products we're launching. So we generally don't think that this closed approach is the best one for the industry from an innovation perspective."

I think we mostly think about these things from the perspective of improving the experiences that we can build. So augmented and virtual reality, I have thought about for a long time because I think that it's sort of the holy",540,"Sure. I can talk about that. I think we mostly think about these things from the perspective of improving the experiences that we can build. So augmented and virtual reality, I have thought about for a long time because I think that it's sort of the holy grail of delivering a sense of presence and the type of social experiences that you would want to build. 
So right now, and I guess for the whole history of the company, we've been constrained to a web browser. And now, in some cases, this increasingly restrictive mobile app rules. But I think that this future environment where you're going to be able to feel like you're really present with someone else, that's going to be really powerful. And it's going to unlock a bunch of experiences that we wanted to build for a long time, and that's what I'm really excited about. 
Similarly, on the commerce side, I mean, part of this is motivated by wanting to help out small businesses and different businesses sell more across our platform. And a lot of it is also just about making the consumer experience better, right? So right now, a lot of times, you'll click on an ad, you'll see an interesting ad, and it'll take you to a website, and the website won't necessarily have full context on who you are. The payment experience will be clunky in doing that. And there's just an opportunity, I think, to make that all a lot more seamless. 
And when it is seamless, it [indiscernible] a better experience for the people using it, but then it also converts better for the businesses and performs better. So I think the way we're going to approach this is largely from starting with having built out this very robust ad system and then just basically working our way down the experience from there. So making it so businesses and creators can have shops and -- but the ads can then link into shops and have a native shopping experience. And then over time, we will also increasingly -- as our payment systems get better and better and more people have credentials on file, I would imagine that going all the way through the funnel will become an increasing part of what people do, and that will both be a better experience for consumers and convert better for businesses. 
Similar story on the creator side here. Our main goal is not necessarily that the creator economy is a major business by itself. But if we become the best place for creators to make a living, then I think that's going to mean that there's better content across the services and better opportunities for community building and engaging people, and that's what we care about. But of course, if there's more engagement and if creators are finding that there are good opportunities to monetize, then they'll engage more with our business products, too, and there will be some opportunity there. 
But -- so I kind of think about all this stuff from the perspective of improving the products. And I think that, that's going to lead to a lot of benefits for all of the stakeholders over the next several years."

So this -- I think recently this week, there were congressional hearings on this concept of algorithmic amplification or how algorithms on Facebook or Instagram surface content to kind of maximize engagement. And sometimes that means some of the more controversial content is what gets surfaced. 
So first off, is that a fair characterization? And if you guys were forced to maybe change up the way all these algorithms work, what kind of impact will that actually have on engagement? I think 10 years ago, the News Feed was kind of the whole story, but now we're talking about many different areas within the app. So how much is from this algorithmic-driven content versus utility-style engagement like going into Messenger or going into Marketplace or something that's just kind of an everyday behavior?"

Overall, I think that the narrative that you are pointing to is dramatically overstated by critics. We do not optimize our systems to increase the amount of time spent in News Feed. I explicitly do not give our News Feed team or the Instagram feed team goals around time spent. Our belief is that if we build a product that is more valuable, then people will engage more. But you should start by trying to build something that's more valuable, not by trying to increase the time that people are spending. So we've done that for years, and I think it's yielded good results. 
So from that perspective, yes, I know that what you're saying is something that some folks like to throw around and say. But I actually think that the more that different regulators or other folks dig into this, I actually think that our practices here are quite robust. And we don't want extreme -- extremist content or any of that stuff on our services. So if anything, to the contrary of trying to promote that, we go out of our way to try to reduce that. 
And I think that, that -- contrary to what a lot of these other folks say is it is actually in our business interest to reduce it because people don't like it, right? I mean, consumers don't like it. Advertisers don't want to be near it. So I don't actually think that this kind of narrative about the company is accurate. And we've tried hard to dispel it. I don't think we've been super successful of that. We will continue trying to work on that. But just to kind of be clear about how I see things, that's the basic download. 
I think News Feed is still a huge part of the products and the home feed in Instagram. But increasingly, Stories is a big deal in Instagram. A lot of people are using Explore and IGTV. Video and Watch on Facebook are quite big. And as you say, a lot of people spend a lot of their time and attention in messaging apps and private interfaces like that as well. So I think that there are a lot of different things that people are doing across the services. But Wehner can jump in with any more color on that, that he wants to add."

In terms of what changed, I think the big piece here is that Quest 2 is doing quite well. I don't want to overstate it because I think compared to platforms that are kind of large, massive successes today, it's still, obviously, on the small end. But there's been a very real inflection in terms of adoption and engagement that we're seeing with Quest 2. 
It feels like there's something about the quality bar that we hit and the price that we hit and the fact that we're able to do that in a wireless form factor. But I think it's just -- first of all, it's going to be really hard for anyone else, I think, to meet those different attributes. Some other folks might try to ship something that they claim is higher quality but has a wire. And I just don't think that consumers are going to want to go for that. So we'll see how all of that plays out. 
But I also just look at how the team is executing and the products that we have in the pipeline. And I want to make sure that we can really go all in and deliver this. But I do admit Quest 2 has been a meaningful step-up from Quest 1 in terms of the progress that we're seeing. 
And content is definitely a part of this. And we have a team internally that's focused on both first party -- I guess it's all, first-party, second-party and third-party content and making partnerships with studios. And that certainly is a big part of this. I think Quest has, I think, by far, the best lineup of VR content. And I think the road map of what's ahead is even more exciting, some of the stuff that's coming over the next few years."

In terms of when these platforms will be more adopted, I think a lot of it is about form factor and use cases. I mean, Quest 2, I think, is -- we kind of hit a key point, but I think that they're still further that we want to go on the form factor of that. But I think the wireless part is key. So I'll just say that again. So I think that there's a lot that you can do in terms of getting products that might have better graphics or something. But with a wire, it really hurts the sense of immersion because you don't want to like have a wire wrapped around your neck while you're doing all this stuff. 
But the other big piece is the use cases, which is why I called out in my remarks in the beginning that one of the promising signs that we're seeing is that it is expanding out beyond games. Now it's still primarily games. But when we started on this journey, a lot of the reason why I said that I thought it made sense for us to invest in this is because I expect virtual and augmented reality to be some of the most social platforms that get built. And the fact that a number of the most engaging experiences on the platforms today are social and a lot of the top games are social, I think, is really promising. But also seeing things in terms of productivity and 
[Audio Gap] 
like I mentioned, is just really promising that you're seeing the early signs of this becoming a broader platform. So there's -- again, I don't want to overstate any of this because it's all quite early still, and all these things need to develop out, but those are very promising signs from my perspective. And as those keep on developing out, then I think the platforms will be broadly applicable to more people. 
And then the other thing I'd say is that we haven't really even gotten there on AR yet, right? I think virtual reality, the form factor constraints, I think, are a little less than what you're going to have an augmented reality, where in virtual reality, I think you need to get to a high-quality wireless experience. In augmented reality, you're going to really need a pair of glasses that look like normal-looking glasses in order for that to hit a mainstream acceptance. And that, I think, is going to be one of the hardest technical challenges of the decade. It's basically fitting a supercomputer in the frame of glasses. So I'm -- I find not a very exciting problem to work on. And I think that once that's achievable, the potential on that is going to be quite big."

I think you see this in some other companies as well that we took in Q1 of last year related to our expectations on collectibility around COVID. So that's factoring in to some of the compares on the growth rates as well. 
And then as you look at the remainder of the year, a couple of things. One is the strength of the business, in general, is giving us confidence, and we're looking for areas to invest more. So we're continuing to invest in research and development across the priorities that Mark outlined in his comments. And then as well, we'll see a pickup in things like marketing in the remainder of the year. So that's what's driving the acceleration of expense growth as you look forward.

First, Sheryl, in the past, you've talked about advertising being kind of a relative ROI gain. So when you think about the shift from iOS changes perhaps going from like an operational short-term headwind to potentially a tailwind as other outlets for advertising lose ROI on a relative basis, like is that something that happens in months, in quarters, in a year? Like talk about how you see that potentially evolving. 
And then second one, Sheryl, you also talked about starting to invest more in building out the consumer experience on the shopping side. So maybe you can just walk us through some of the things you think Facebook can uniquely bring into e-commerce that might make for a newer, better user experience. Is that AR/VR? Is that -- what are some of the things that could really make Facebook stand out for consumers on e-commerce?"

They're going to advertise on TV, on radio, on billboards, on different online platforms, and they're looking for relative ROI. That means a signal goes down and it goes down everywhere we're competing differently. 
Our goal is to make sure that we can still do personalized ads. We do think that our relative competitive advantage has been that our ads are more personalized. And that's really important because as in some of the examples I shared, most small businesses, the yoga studio in Detroit can't afford to advertise to everyone in Detroit, much less everyone in Michigan, much less everyone in the U.S. And so advertising using who lives there and who's likely to be interested in yoga and meditation is really important. 
We believe we will still be relatively better positioned. Virtual -- based to -- not all players, right, because we're not running the platforms, but based on many, we're still going to do better at that than a lot of digital players. We're still going to do better at that than TV or radio. But when signal goes down, we're going to have to rebuild that capability, and that's what I talked about. 
In terms of the timing you asked specifically, we really don't know. The iOS 14 changes are really new. Regulatory changes that might happen at a state level or a global or a regional level or a national level haven't happened yet. So we'll have to see. And I don't have a real sense of what those changes will be, what their impact will be right now. But we are very focused on competing for those ad dollars and doing it as well as we can. 
In the consumer experience on the shopping side, where we are right now is we launched the shop -- a lot of the shopping tools, and we've had broad business adoption, and that's been good. We don't offer the full suite of tools that a lot of other places do. But more and more, we have shops functionality that people are adopting. We really need to work on the consumer side of the experience. 
I do think we have a unique opportunity there. You asked again, like what is our -- I think -- this is my language, not yours, but I think you were asking like what is our sustainable competitive advantage here. We have a lot of people doing a lot of activity. We increasingly have people looking for products. We increasingly have people finding products. And so we've always been strong at the top of the funnel. Can we move people down the funnel? We think we can. But that's going to take work, and it's also going to take some time for people to get used to that. 
But in terms of the long-run competitive advantage, we have a lot of people looking for a lot of things, sharing a lot of things and continuing to find things they really like. And so I'm very optimistic about our opportunity here, but it's going to take real work."

But when it comes to helping people reach the largest audience or finding their specific audience, I think we are world-class at that. I think we're the best at that. And then in terms of monetization, I also think that as our business results show, we are very efficient at that. And if we can put that to work for creators to help them make money from their work, then that can help achieve this goal of enabling millions of people to make a living through this kind of creative work. 
So I think on those 2 pieces, especially on the monetization side and on the helping people connect with their specific community and getting as much distribution as possible, I think that we're going to do some really great and unique work to help a lot of creators out. And then we'll build out the broader suite of tools, too, but I think that those 2 places are really where we enter this from."

And I think it's -- if you had to pick 1 vertical, it would be commerce that outperformed. But it's a -- and that dovetails nicely, obviously, with our commerce efforts. But it's really been a broader story than that. Really, almost every vertical was very strong. I think we're still kind of -- we're still seeing recovery in some of the verticals that were weaker from COVID like travel. But we're starting to see, I think, some signs of life there in some other verticals that were negatively impacted by COVID. But the -- but really just strong across-the-board demand for ads has been what's driven it for us. 
I think the 2-year compare that you talked about is a helpful compare because there's a lot of noise in our year-over-year revenue growth rates when you look just at 2020 compared to 2021. And if you do sort of a 2-year compare, I think -- and looked at the year-over-year growth rates by quarter, I think we'd expect a more normalized rate of deceleration of growth, not just all of the bouncing around from the weak quarters that we're going to have and then I think correspondingly stronger quarters as the year progresses from a compare basis into 2020. But yes, the simple story, advertiser demand, better than we expected."

This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services. And I'm excited about our product road map ahead. I want to start t",2077,"Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services. And I'm excited about our product road map ahead. 
I want to start today by discussing some of the themes that we're seeing in our -- and our major efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform. Each of these areas is important and is going to unlock a lot of value on its own, but they're also building blocks for the future of the Internet and the future vision for our company. And I'll discuss that as well. 
So first, let's talk about creators.  Now we want our platform to be the best place for millions of creators to earn a living. And if we can do this, then our services will also have the best content across many different types of media, from text and photos to audio, gaming and video. Video, in particular, is becoming the primary way that people use our products and express themselves. 
I know this is a theme that we've been talking about for a few years now, but we've been executing on this for a while, and video has steadily become more important in our product. Video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, and Reels is already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. 
Across all forms of video, short-form video like Reels is growing especially quickly. We're very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first. 
Now people like to watch videos recommended by our personalized algorithms. So this gives creators a good way to reach new people who don't follow them yet. And this is also a good complement to our social feeds, and it's an area where our progress in AI is going to make the experience a lot better in the coming months and years. 
On-demand video like in Facebook Watch is also growing quickly and is now growing faster than other types of video or content in News Feed. We're building a number of new video monetization tools for creators that can get compensated for making great content. 
So for example, last year, people spent more than $50 million of stars to game stream creators going live on Facebook alone. And now we're extending stars to fans can send them to any creator during on-demand video as well. 
I also want to call out live video for a moment. This is a smaller percent of our overall video on our services, but it's some of the most unique content and gives creators a way to build community and engage with their followers. And we're also focused on developing monetization tools like live breaks for mid-roll ads and live shopping, so creators can make a living and engage their communities more deeply in commerce with their content. 
So overall, there's a lot more to do here. And as it becomes the majority of engagement across our services in the coming years, we're going to continue to focus on. 
We're also focused on other types of creators beyond video. And some of the most interesting emergent behavior that we're seeing is creators using a lot of different types of content to engage their communities. So we launched live audio rooms this quarter as well as podcasts. We also launched Bulletin, our publishing and subscription service for writers and with features help and find and grow their audiences, including integrations with groups, Facebook Live and live audio rooms.  
To help grow the creator economy overall, we're going to keep our creator tools free to use through 2023. And we recently announced that we are investing $1 billion in creators across Facebook and Instagram. So I'm optimistic that creators will get more opportunities to do the work that they want, and that's going to lead to people hearing lots of new voices across our different services. 
The second area that I want to talk about today is commerce. Our goal here is to create better experiences for people interacting with businesses and to help businesses grow even more on our platform. Our approach is to work our way down the stack and build world-class services at every layer of commerce, starting from discovery at the top of the stack all the way down to payments. And just like we want to be the best place for millions of creators to make a living, we also want to be the best place for businesses to grow as well. 
We started here by building world-class ad tools to help businesses reach potential customers and help people discover new products and services that they might like. But what we found is that when these ads link off site, you often land on a web page that's not personalized or not optimized or where you have to reenter your payment information, and that's not a good experience for people, and it doesn't lead to the best results for businesses either. 
So our next phase here is focused on building out Shops, Marketplace, business messaging in WhatsApp and Messenger to create more native commerce experiences across our apps. There's a lot of work here to do to support all of the business tools natively that already exist for the web. 
But as we bring more of this online and enable more of this, it's going to create a superior consumer experience, and it's going to convert better for businesses. This is going to lead to more businesses investing and building out their presences across our services, and that will lead to even more diversity of products for people to discover and interact with. 
So this is a long-term strategy. It's going to take a while before it's meaningful, especially given the scale of our ad business already, but I'm confident that it's the right long-term bet and product direction. 
And as we work our way down the stack from discovery and ads to native commerce store front, we're also making progress on payments at the same time. So WhatsApp payments are now available to everyone in Brazil as well as India. Lots of people are already using this as a simple and secure way to send money to friends. We're adding new payments features in Messenger in the U.S. like QR codes. We also just announced that we're making Facebook Pay available outside of our apps for the first time, which means that you're going to start seeing it as a checkout option on the web and especially in web views that you see within our app after clicking on ads or other business content. 
The commerce experiences are now accessible across most of our services, and we have a full road map of deeper integrations that I'm excited about in the months ahead. 
The third area I want to talk about is building the next computing platform. We're continuing to invest very heavily in building technology and products to deliver a full sense of presence. This is going to be critical for unlocking the next generation of social Internet services. Quest 2, in particular, continues doing well, and it keeps getting better monthly as we release regular software updates, including most recently, our pass-through APIs, so developers can start building mixed-reality experiences on Quest. 
The range of content and experiences that we're seeing keeps broadening as well to the point where there are a lot of popular virtual reality experiences beyond games at this point. The most popular apps on Quest are social, which fits our original thesis here that virtual reality will be a social platform. And that's why we're so focused on building it. But we're also seeing compelling use cases in other forms of entertainment as well as work, creativity and fitness. 
Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things. So I'm excited to get those into people's hands and to continue to make progress on the journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future. 
Now the areas that I've discussed today: creators, commerce and the next computing platform, they're each important priorities for us, and they each can unlock a lot of value on their own. But together, these efforts are also part of a much larger goal: to help build the metaverse. And I'll be sharing a lot more about this in the months ahead. So I wanted to discuss this now so you can see the future that we're working towards and how our major initiatives across the company are going to map to that. 
So what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this as an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet. 
You're going to be able to access the metaverse from all different devices and different levels of fidelity from apps on phones and PCs to immersive virtual and augmented reality devices. Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more. You're basically going to be able to do everything that you can on the Internet today as well as some things that don't make sense on the Internet today, like dancing. 
The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place. Creation, avatars and digital objects are going to be central to how we express ourselves, and this is going to lead to entirely new experiences and economic opportunities. 
I think that, overall, this is one of the most exciting projects that we're going to get to work on in our lifetime. But it's going to take a lot of work. And no one company is going to be able to build this all by themselves. 
Part of what I've learned over the last 5 years is that we can't just focus on building great experiences. We also need to make sure that we're helping to build ecosystems so millions of other people can participate in the upside and opportunity of what we're all creating. There are going to need to be new protocols and standards, new devices, new chips, new software for rendering engines, payment systems and everything in between. And in order for the metaverse to fill its potential, we believe that it should be built in a way that is open for everyone to participate. 
I expect that this is going to create a lot of value for many companies up and down the stack, but it's also going to require a very significant investment over many years. I see our focus here as a continuation of our work to build technology that brings people together. 
In many ways, the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology. Some of the experiences that I've dreamed of building since well before I started Facebook are only starting to become possible now. 
If you look at the investments that we've made over the years, you can see this vision gradually starting to come to focus. And you can see why we're so excited about it. 
So in addition to being the next generation of the Internet, the metaverse is also going to be the next chapter for us as a company. In the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company. And there's a lot that we need to do to get there. And there are going to be many exciting milestones along the way, including some which we'll share in the months ahead. But in the meantime, I just want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community, all of our partners and employees and everyone who has supported us so far. I continue to be grateful to be on this journey with all of you. And now here is Sheryl."
20765463,1672792639,2353373,"Facebook, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","[indiscernible] everyone. Thanks, Mark. I hope you're all safe and healthy. This was a really strong quarter for our business. Our total revenue for Q2 was $29.1 billion, which is a 56% year-over-year increase.

This was a really strong quarter for our business. Our total revenue for Q2 was $29.1 billion, which is a 56% year-over-year increase. We've seen strong growth in all regions and across most verticals. Our strongest verticals are those that have performed well throughout the pandemic, including e-commerce, retail and CPG. And we're also seeing continued recovery in others like travel that were hit hard by COVID. 
Our performance continues to be driven by the ongoing digital transformation. This has accelerated during the pandemic and our long-term investments in tools and products to help businesses make the shift online. 
Not long ago, it was much harder and much more expensive for businesses to create a digital presence, take orders online and reach customers remotely. Our tools and products make these things easier and more accessible. 
Businesses and creators can set up pages, profiles and Shops from Facebook and Instagram. They can engage with customers directly in groups or through Messenger and WhatsApp, and they can tell their stories in creative ways with real stories or by going live on Facebook and Instagram. 
With personalized ads, they can easily reach the people most likely to be interested in their products or services for just a few dollars. This has helped so many businesses, especially small businesses, find success when reaching people in person have been much harder. 
A great example is the Pizza Cupcake, a family-owned baking business in New York City. They've been selling it pop-up Shops since 2018. But when COVID hit, pop-up locations shut down and catering events canceled. So in March last year, they became an e-commerce business. 
In Q3, they tested their first Facebook ad campaigns in the New York Tristate area and by the following quarter, ramped up their budget to sell across 28 states. They since made 3 new hires and plan to start shipping nationwide this year. They've expanded production, which has also led to jobs being created at fulfillment centers in Maryland, Florida, Arizona and California. 
We're constantly working to improve the effectiveness of our ad products to help businesses like the Pizza Cupcake take reach customers and get a great return on their investment. We're doing this through investments in machine learning and monetization of newer surfaces like Stories and Reel. In all of this, we're planning for the long term. 
Mark talked about some of the key elements of our strategy going forward. So I'll focus on the strategy for the ads business. If you think about the journey we've been on over the past decade or so, we started with desktop ads on the right-hand side of people's feeds. Then consumers shifted to mobile, and we put ads in News Feed. And quarter after quarter, year after year, as we've created great new consumer products like Stories or Reels, we found the right way for advertisers to reach consumers within these products. And we're constantly working to make our ads deliver more for businesses and be more relevant for people. 
To support the growth of our ads business over the next 10 years, it's going to take a similar effort. We need to build on our success by developing innovative new products and discovery experiences while giving everyone more control over their personal information. 
To build the next era of personalized experiences, we're focused on product innovations in 4 areas. 
The first is discovery. We want to keep making our app the best places to discover products and businesses you'll love. For example, we're testing a new experience in News Feed where you can tap to browse content from businesses on topics like beauty, fitness or clothing. And we're using context to make smarter recommendations about which ads to show. So if you're watching a travel video, we could show ads for hotels and flights. 
The second area is commerce, which Mark touched on a moment ago. We're building a modern commerce system across ads, community tools, messaging, Shops and payments. It's all about creating a personalized, seamless customer journey where it's easier to discover products, buy it, pay for it and have it delivered to your doorstep. 
The third area is privacy-enhancing technologies. We know businesses are experiencing challenges because of platform changes. We want to make sure they can continue getting great results through privacy-safe, personalized ads long into the future. So we're collaborating across the industry to develop new technologies to help minimize the amount of personal information we process while still allowing us to show relevant ads and measure their effectiveness. 
The fourth is building tools that help businesses beyond marketing. We want to help solve all kinds of business needs, whether it's customer relationship management, business messaging tools or hiring through Facebook jobs. 
We're helping people run their business across our apps easily with Facebook Business Suite. We're making it easier to message customers across our apps from a single interface. And we're expanding our Messenger API for Instagram as customers increasingly rely on messaging instead of phone calls. 
The digital transformation is a long-term trend that isn't going away. By focusing on innovation in these 4 areas, we will continue to help businesses of all sizes make the shift online and reach customers with privacy-safe, personalized advertising. 
As ever, I'm grateful to all the businesses who work with us, and I continue to be amazed by our teams all over the world. Throughout this period, we've been really lucky to have so many brilliant people working hard to keep people connected and help businesses survive and thrive online. 
Now over to Dave."
20765463,1672792639,2353373,"Facebook, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter as our services continue to help millions of businesses reach customers around the world. Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approxim",1034,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 
We delivered strong results in the second quarter as our services continue to help millions of businesses reach customers around the world. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis in June and that approximately 3.5 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Our global community continue to grow even as we lapped elevated user growth in the second quarter of last year related to the pandemic. 
Facebook daily active users reached 1.91 billion, up 7% or 123 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.9 billion monthly active users in June. MAUs grew by 194 million or 7% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $29.1 billion, up 56% or 50% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind. And had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 of last year, total revenue would have been $982 million lower. On a 2-year basis, Q2 total revenue growth decelerated to 72% from 74% in the first quarter. 
Q2 ad revenue was $28.6 billion, up 56% or 51% on a constant currency basis. The macroeconomic environment for online advertising remains very strong. As Sheryl noted, the growth in the advertising revenue was largely driven by verticals that have performed well during the pandemic such as online commerce and consumer packaged goods. In addition, we have -- we saw improved growth trends in verticals that were particularly challenged during the pandemic, such as travel, entertainment and media. 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions as we lapped the strongest quarter of last year. This is the second quarter of last year, which was the period hardest hit by the pandemic. Growth was strongest in the rest of world at 86%. Europe, Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada grew 63%, 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of World, all benefited from currency tailwinds. 
In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 47%. Impression growth was primarily driven by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific, while pricing growth benefited from broad-based strength in advertiser demand. Recall that in the second quarter of 2020, the effects of the pandemic contributed to elevated impressions and depressed prices, which we are now lapping. 
Other revenue was $497 million, up 36%. Other revenue growth continues to be driven by Quest 2 sales, though the rate of growth slowed in the second quarter as we entered a seasonally slower sales period. We also recorded a revenue adjustment for returns related to the Quest 2 foam facial interface recall. 
Turning now to expenses. Q2 total expenses were $16.7 billion, up 31% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items: cost of revenue increased 41% driven by consumer hardware costs, payments partners and core infrastructure investments. R&D increased 37%, driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 15%, mainly driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 23% driven mostly by employee-related costs and legal expenses. 
We added over 2,700 net new hires in Q2, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 63,400 full-time employees, up 21% compared to last year. Second quarter operating income was $12.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $10.4 billion or $3.61 per share. Capital expenditures, including capital leases, were $4.7 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. 
Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $7.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with $64.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
In terms of our sustainability efforts, we remain focused on achieving our goal to reach net zero emissions for our entire value chain in 2030. In June, we released our second annual sustainability report, which details our work towards achieving our objectives. 
Turning now to the outlook. Similar to the second quarter, we expect that advertising revenue growth will be primarily driven by year-over-year advertising price increases during the rest of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. When viewing growth on a 2-year basis to exclude the impacts from lapping the COVID recovery, we expect [ year over -- 2-year  ] total revenue growth rates to decelerate modestly in the second half compared to the second quarter rate. 
We continue to expect increasing ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a more significant impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
As noted in recent earnings calls, we continue to monitor developments related -- regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. 
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven primarily by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure and consumer hardware-related costs. Our expenses outlook reflects our commitment to invest ahead of the compelling long-term growth opportunities we see across our product portfolio. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We expect our full year 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. 
In closing, we are pleased with the strong performance of our business and remain committed to innovating on behalf of the people and businesses who use our services around the world. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

In order to do that, each layer of the funnel that we're working on, we want to be world class on its own, which means that basically, there's this whole long tail of functionality that businesses have come to expect on the web and from other tools, and we need to make sure that that's available for Shops and business messaging and all the tools, whether we do that through partnerships with other e-commerce companies or building it up ourselves. 
So it's -- we're seeing meaningful improvements every quarter in this in terms of how effective these are. There are already a pretty meaningful number of merchants and people who are using Shops, and we expect this to compound over the coming years. But I just think in terms of the scale of the ads business that we're starting at, I just think realistically, we shouldn't expect that this is going to be a meaningful driver of our business or profitability in the near term. It's just going to take a while for that compounding to become meaningful numbers. 
So I think the strategy is the right one. It's creating a better product experience for people. When you click on an ad or when you engage with a business, it's just going to be much better to do that natively, whether you're in Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp or whatever you're using, than go to a website that doesn't have your payment information and it isn't personalized. So I think we're on the right path here, and we're focused on compounding this as quickly as we can. 
I guess, with the second question on the creator economy, I mean, yes, there are a number of different companies that are focused on this. I'd say there are a couple of things here that are interesting properties of this. 
One is that if you're a creator and you're trying to get your content out there and you're trying to make a living, you want to be in all these different platforms. So I think a lot of what we're trying to do is it's not necessarily the case that people are going to be on one platform versus another. We just want to make it so that the creators have their best content here and that we can help them make a living better than other platforms. And we think that if we do, we'll have an advantage on content over the long term. But it's not like we fundamentally have to win creators over from another place. 
Our monetization tools, I think, are a pretty big advantage that we bring to the table. Our advertising is world-class. So the ability to basically help creators make more money from the work that they're already doing, I think it's something that we should really be able to bring those set of tools to the table. We also have a lot of distribution that -- and ability to -- for people to find their communities and help personalize recommendations to help connect people with the people who are going to be interested in their content. 
So that is -- that's some of what we're seeing and why a lot of creators are excited about the work that we're doing. And over the long term, I think if we're able to make it so that millions of creators are able to make a living across our platforms, I think that that's just going to mean that there's going to be a long-term breadth and healthy set of content across the systems that I think is going to be increasingly important, especially as video becomes more important on our platforms, like what we're seeing both with Watch and Reel now."

It's hard to predict how that's going to play out in this cycle. But that's kind of the best read on that I can give you at this point."

And on the Metaverse point, what we're primarily focused on here before I get into the business model, our basic playbook as a company is build products that get to scale, especially social products. It's important the people you want to interact with are there. We're going to focus on having hundreds of millions of people use the metaverse and the new platforms that we're building before we really turn this into what I expect to be a very important and big part of the business. 
But overall, and I think that there's -- as we embark on this next chapter, ads are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do, and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse too. I think commerce is going to be increasingly important, which is why we're -- one of the reasons why we're focused on this across our current apps and the current economy. But I think digital goods and creators are just going to be huge, right, in terms of people expressing themselves through their avatars, through digital clothing, through digital goods, the apps that they have, that they bring with them from place to place. A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another. So being able to basically have your digital goods and your inventory and bring them from place to place, that's going to be a big investment that people make. 
And our focus for now is really on helping to develop the community, helping to develop a number of people who grow the number of people who can be in these metaverse experiences and can experience in these next computing platforms like virtual and augmented reality. And that's, I think, what you should expect us to focus on over the next period. But over the long term, I think that there's going to be a very big digital economy around this. And that's what we're primarily going to be shooting for. 
Our business model isn't going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible. So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. 
So that's kind of at a high level how I'm thinking about this. And I'm happy to talk about this more as we continue to evolve the investment. And Dave can speak about the expenses and disclosures and all that. But I will note that I appreciate the ingenuity and cleverness of looking to our job descriptions just to see where we're investing.

In terms of impression growth, we had called out last quarter that we would expect for the remainder of 2021 for pricing to be a bigger driver of growth. So -- and mentioned at that time, there were a few factors driving it. The biggest factor is lapping the COVID engagement that we saw that was particularly pronounced in North America where we saw more engagement related to the lockdowns and higher impression growth last year. So that is one of the big factors. 
The other factor that we're seeing is us shift towards video, both for our products and other products. And that's just generally a big trend in the market, and that tends to have a lower impressions per the amount of engagement than things like News Feed. So kind of both those things are factors, but the COVID factor is the one that I would call out. 
And when you think about how we're expanding services to create more ad inventory, I would say that we've got a number of impression growth opportunities. We've seen growing impression contributions from new services like Instagram Explore broadly within video, Marketplace. And then when we look forward, I think Reels is a really significant future opportunity. We've only just really begun to make ads available globally on Reels. 
So when you kind of look at all of these different services, we think there are a lot of good growth opportunities. They're still small in absolute size compared to things like feed and Stories, but big opportunities for growth. 
In terms of your question on ATT, so the impact from the ATT changes has really generally been in line with our expectation. We're obviously benefiting as others are from a very strong macro environment for advertising. But look, this has been very challenging for advertisers to navigate, and we're working with them to help them navigate these changes. And we've introduced solutions to help them do that through approaches like our aggregated events management API, which is aggregated data for targeting and measurement. Obviously, we're doing a lot of work on using machine learning and AI to help rank apps and make them more valuable. But overall, we do think there are opportunities to continue to improve our capabilities through investment in areas like machine learning and AI to make ads more effective. And if we can get advertisers to get the same number of conversions from fewer ads, that's great. That works for them, and it creates more value for the ads for us."

And then given the rise in pricing, just to address the issue. I know you've done it in the past, the extent to which that's had a material impact on ROI for marketers. I know it's an auction-based system. But as prices rise, is there should -- is there any reason to be concerned about whether there will be some marketers that would be priced out because of that and create less optimal outcomes for your platform?"

And the good news is that's good pressure in the system because it makes the ads more relevant for the people who are seeing them. 
Once you are really incentivized within an auction to find the thing that is returning for you, that's actually almost always the thing that is the most relevant for people who are seeing the ads. And I think that's been a good system and good pressure within the system going forward. 
We're certainly seeing our large brand advertisers continue to spend and get better at using personalization in our ad formats. And we're seeing small advertisers be able to compete very effectively. Doesn't mean that rising prices aren't an issue sometimes. But I think overall, this is where the auction system serves us well and most importantly, serves consumers well."

So whether that's companies like NVIDIA that are building a lot of the graphics chips that are going to be really important for a lot of the content that I think is going to be increasingly graphically intense, that's certainly building those kind of graphics chips is not a thing that we're intending to get into. So we're certainly counting on companies like that in the industry to kind of continue improving and compounding overall. 
But on the hardware side, I would say that we have a pretty big program on building virtual and augmented reality devices. And I mean sure, a lot of people are still going to be using phones and computers for a long time. But I think when it gets to what are the devices that are going to deliver the deepest sense of presence and that are going to be increasingly important over the next decade, we're certainly investing in that because we want to make sure that those develop in a way that's in line with the vision of these platforms helping people to interact with each other and socialize. And that means prioritizing certain feature development or certain sensors in the devices that we want to make sure that we can help push that in a direction that will help leave these to become a very social platform. 
So overall, I do think this is going to be a big space. The point that I was making is that I think there are going to be a lot of winners and this is going to be not something that one company builds alone, but I think it is going to be a whole ecosystem that needs to develop. But we're certainly making a lot of the key investments that we need to make in the foundational technology to be able to deliver the parts that we want to."

We're working on cross-app communication between them, business messaging APIs. I mean a lot of this is very much -- the business messaging, I think, is going to be an important part of commerce and helping people interact with businesses in a way that is natural to them. 
The cross-sell communication in terms of helping people reach people wherever they are, it kind of fits into this vision that we have for the future of people being able to easily teleport between experiences that I think is going to be increasingly important as we move towards the metaverse. 
People are going to need messaging services, that's going to continue to be a core way that people communicate. People are going to want to reach the people they care about no matter what service they're on and be able to move between these. 
So when I talk about kind of interoperability and moving more there in the future, we're trying to get our core experiences today aligned with that as well. The other thing [indiscernible] messaging is the connect to the business today is that click-to-messaging ads are one of the parts of the ad business that is growing quickly and doing quite well. And part of that is because even if we're not charging a lot directly for the messaging APIs for businesses that if the interactions between people and businesses end up helping businesses convert better and drive more sales, then business is naturally going to want to pay to have their ads point towards that rather than other services that we may not control or that may be a worse experience. So that's on the messaging side. 
On the AI side, I think this is a really good question. It's probably something that doesn't come up as much on these earnings calls is it probably should for how important of a driver of the progress in AI is for our overall results. One of the things that I've observed in just running the business over the last couple of years is there's a lot of focus on kind of different headwinds that we may face, whether it's from other platforms or regulation or different things. 
But one of the areas that I think has routinely outperformed our expectations is progress on AI. And we don't have a single product, which is like an AI product that's sort of the embodiment of all the AI work. That's not something that we've done yet. But we basically -- we have a very large investment in AI and we build out this platform, but then all of our products use. So when we make foundational improvements, it makes ranking better in News Feed and in Reels and ads and it makes our detection and our integrity systems more effective at identifying stuff, everything just gets better. And this has really been one of the big tailwinds or waves that we've been riding. 
And just from what I can see technologically on the horizon, it really doesn't seem like this is going to be slowing down anytime soon. And I don't think that this is a Facebook-specific thing. I think that this is probably across the whole industry or maybe even across the whole economy more broadly. But I do think that the progress that's being made at the fundamental levels with AI is driving a lot of progress and is one of the important macro effects that we're seeing. 
For PyTorch specifically, I mean it certainly helps that the framework that we use to develop our AI work is one that's embraced by the community. So a lot of times when we go to spin up a new project, there will already have been some team that contributed an open-source library to it, and that makes it easy. So I think that there certainly are dividends that we get from having developed or helped develop to become an increasing standard, especially among researchers and it's certainly an area that we're going to focus on investing more in. I think that the core AI platform is just an important part of the progress that we're seeing overall."

And we think we're continually getting better at monetizing video, but they are still monetizing at lower rates versus Feed Stories, but we have a lot here. We have 2 billion people watching in-stream ad eligible videos per month. 
Mobile-first video is increasing, meaning even brand advertisers are getting better at doing mobile-first video. And certainly, we think advertisers are looking for the best place to reach audiences, and we compare very favorably across the board. 
I'll share really, I think, cool recent examples. Walmart, a very large advertiser engaged Redrumond, who's the Pioneer Woman cooking show host to host their first live shopping event. And the event was to launch her Walmart exclusive line of home and fashion products. And they used a mix of our personal ads to drive awareness to a live shopping event and then reengaged viewers after the purchase, and they had really great results across the board. 
They ran part of that live as video ads and resulted in thousands of engagements, a lot of [indiscernible] a lot of engagement with people and sales. 
And so I think that's a good example of our products like Live, combined with the use of video on our platform, combined with people taking an opportunity for video ads and putting it all together in ways I think will compete very favorably with other formats like TV."

I don't have specific data to share, but I mean just contextually, the work that we're doing with the aggregated events management API as part of the broader work that we're doing to rebuild meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system can continue to perform while having access to less data in the future. And it really dovetails into some of the work that Mark was talking about with machine learning and AI because that's going to be an important part of being able to make better use of less data. 
And so again, why having access to the ML and AI capabilities that we have with Facebook is going to be so important to the future and maintaining and growing the efficacy of ads. So I think broadly, we're pleased with the progress we're making on this. It is disruptive for advertisers to have to go through the process of also learning how to retool. So I don't want to lessen the impact this is having on our advertisers. I think it is a challenging period for them, and we're trying to help them work through it as effectively as we can. 
So with that, I think we are done. So thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today, and hope everybody stays safe."

This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services. And I'm excited about our product road map ahead. I want to start t",2080,"Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services. And I'm excited about our product road map ahead. 
I want to start today by discussing some of the themes that we're seeing in our major efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform. Each of these areas is important and is going to unlock a lot of value on its own, but they're also building blocks for the future of the Internet and the future vision for our company. And I'll discuss that as well. 
So first, let's talk about creators. Now we want our platforms to be the best place for millions of creators to earn a living. And if we can do this, then our services will also have the best content across many different types of media, from text and photos to audio, gaming and video. Video, in particular, is becoming the primary way that people use our products and express themselves. 
I know this is a theme that we've been talking about for a few years now, but we've been executing on this for a while, and video has steadily become more important in our product. Video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, and Reels is already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. 
Across all forms of video, short-form video like Reels is growing especially quickly. We're very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first. 
Now people like to watch videos recommended by our personalized algorithms, so this gives creators a good way to reach new people who don't follow them yet. And this is also a good complement to our social feeds, and it's an area where our progress in AI is going to make the experience a lot better in the coming months and years. 
On-demand video like in Facebook Watch is also growing quickly and is now growing faster than other types of video or content in News Feed. We're building a number of new video monetization tools for creators that can get compensated for making great content. 
So for example, last year, people spent more than $50 million of stars to game stream creators going live on Facebook alone. And now we're extending stars so fans can send them to any creator during on-demand video as well. 
I also want to call out live video for a moment. This is a smaller percent of our overall video on our services, but it's some of the most unique content and gives creators a way to build community and engage with their followers. And we're also focused on developing monetization tools like Live Breaks for midroll ads and Live Shopping, so creators can make a living and engage their communities more deeply in commerce with their content. 
So overall, there's a lot more to do here. And as it becomes the majority of engagement across our services in the coming years, we're going to continue to focus on that. 
We're also focused on other types of creators beyond video. And some of the most interesting emergent behavior that we're seeing is creators using a lot of different types of content to engage their communities. So we've launched Live Audio Rooms this quarter as well as podcasts. We also launched Bulletin, our publishing and subscription service for writers and with features to help them find and grow their audiences, including integrations with Groups, Facebook Live and Live Audio Room. 
To help grow the creator economy overall, we're going to keep our creator tools free to use through 2023. And we recently announced that we are investing $1 billion in creators across Facebook and Instagram. So I'm optimistic that creators will get more opportunities to do the work that they want, and that's going to lead to people hearing lots of new voices across our different services. 
The second area that I want to talk about today is commerce. Our goal here is to create better experiences for people interacting with businesses and to help businesses grow even more on our platform. Our approach is to work our way down the stack and build world-class services at every layer of commerce, starting from discovery at the top of the stack all the way down to payments. And just like we want to be the best place for millions of creators to make a living, we also want to be the best place for businesses to grow as well. 
We started here by building world-class ad tools to help businesses reach potential customers and help people discover new products and services that they might like. But what we found is that when these ads link off site, you often land on a web page that's not personalized or not optimized or where you have to reenter your payment information, and that's not a good experience for people, and it doesn't lead to the best results for businesses either. 
So our next phase here is focused on building out Shops, Marketplace, business messaging in WhatsApp and Messenger to create more native commerce experiences across our apps. There's a lot of work here to do to support all of the business tools natively that already exist for the web. 
But as we bring more of this online and enable more of this, it's going to create a superior consumer experience, and it's going to convert better for businesses. This is going to lead to more businesses investing and building out their presences across our services, and that will lead to even more diversity of products for people to discover and interact with. 
So this is a long-term strategy. It's going to take a while before it's meaningful, especially given the scale of our ads business already, but I'm confident that it's the right long-term bet and product direction. 
And as we work our way down the stack from discovery and ads to native commerce store front, we're also making progress on payments at the same time. So WhatsApp Payments are now available to everyone in Brazil as well as India. Lots of people are already using this as a simple and secure way to send money to friends. We're adding new payments features in Messenger in the U.S. like QR codes. We also just announced that we're making Facebook Pay available outside of our apps for the first time, which means that you're going to start seeing it as a checkout option on the web and especially in web views that you see within our app after clicking on ads or other business content. 
The commerce experiences are now accessible across most of our services, and we have a full road map of deeper integrations that I'm excited about in the months ahead. 
The third area I want to talk about is building the next computing platform. We're continuing to invest very heavily in building technology and products to deliver a full sense of presence. This is going to be critical for unlocking the next generation of social Internet services. Quest 2, in particular, continues doing well, and it keeps getting better monthly as we release regular software updates, including most recently, our pass-through APIs, so developers can start building mixed-reality experiences on Quest. 
The range of content and experiences that we're seeing keeps broadening as well to the point where there are a lot of popular virtual reality experiences beyond games at this point. The most popular apps on Quest are social, which fits our original thesis here that virtual reality will be a social platform. And that's why we're so focused on building it. But we're also seeing compelling use cases in other forms of entertainment as well as work, creativity and fitness. 
Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things. So I'm excited to get those into people's hands and to continue to make progress on the journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future. 
Now the areas that I've discussed today: creators, commerce and the next computing platform, they're each important priorities for us, and they're each going to unlock a lot of value on their own. But together, these efforts are also part of a much larger goal: to help build the metaverse. And I'll be sharing a lot more about this in the months ahead. So I wanted to discuss this now so you can see the future that we're working towards and how our major initiatives across the company are going to map to that. 
So what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this as an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet. 
You're going to be able to access the metaverse from all different devices and different levels of fidelity from apps on phones and PCs to immersive virtual and augmented reality devices. Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more. You're basically going to be able to do everything that you can on the Internet today as well as some things that don't make sense on the Internet today, like dancing. 
The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place. Creation, avatars and digital objects are going to be central to how we express ourselves, and this is going to lead to entirely new experiences and economic opportunities. 
I think that, overall, this is one of the most exciting projects that we're going to get to work on in our lifetime. But it's going to take a lot of work. And no one company is going to be able to build this all by themselves. 
Part of what I've learned over the last 5 years is that we can't just focus on building great experiences, we also need to make sure that we're helping to build ecosystems so millions of other people can participate in the upside and opportunity of what we're all creating. There are -- going to need to be new protocols and standards, new devices, new chips, new software from rendering engines to payment systems and everything in between. And in order for the metaverse to fill its potential, we believe that it should be built in a way that is open for everyone to participate. 
I expect that this is going to create a lot of value for many companies up and down the stack, but it's also going to require a very significant investment over many years. I see our focus here as a continuation of our work to build technology that brings people together. 
In many ways, the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology. Some of the experiences that I've dreamed of building since well before I started Facebook are only starting to become possible now. If you look at the investments that we've made over the years, you can see this vision gradually starting to come to focus. And you can see why we're so excited about it. 
So in addition to being the next generation of the Internet, the metaverse is also going to be the next chapter for us as a company. And in the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company. And there's a lot that we need to do to get there. And there are going to be many exciting milestones along the way, including some which we'll share in the months ahead. 
But in the meantime, I just want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community, all of our partners and employees and everyone who has supported us so far. I continue to be grateful to be on this journey with all of you. 
And now here is Sheryl."

This was a really strong quarter for our business. Our total revenue for Q2 was $29.1 billion, which is a 56% year-over-year increase. We've seen strong growth in all regions and across most verticals. Our strongest verticals are those that have performed well through the -- throughout the pandemic, including e-commerce, retail and CPG. And we're also seeing continued recovery in others like travel that were hit hard by COVID. Our performance continues to be driven by the ongoing digital transformation, which has accelerated during the pandemic and our long-term investments in tools and products to help businesses make the shift online. 
Not long ago, it was much harder and much more expensive for businesses to create a digital presence, take orders online and reach customers remotely. Our tools and products make these things easier and more accessible. Businesses and creators can set up pages, profiles and shops from Facebook and Instagram. They can engage with customers directly in groups or through Messenger and WhatsApp, and they can tell their stories in creative ways with real stories or by going live on Facebook and Instagram. 
With personalized ads, they can easily reach the people most likely to be interested in their products or services for just a few dollars. This has helped so many businesses, especially small businesses, find success when reaching people in person have been much harder. 
A great example is The Pizza Cupcake, a family-owned baking business in New York City. They've been selling at pop-up shops since 2018. But when COVID hit, pop-up locations shut down and catering events canceled. So in March last year, they became an e-commerce business. In Q3, they tested their first Facebook Ad campaigns in the New York Tri-State Area. And by the following quarter, ramped up their budget to sell across 28 states. They since made 3 new hires and plan to start shipping nationwide this year. They've expanded production, which has also led to jobs being created at fulfillment centers in Maryland, Florida, Arizona and California. 
We're constantly working to improve the effectiveness of our ad products to help businesses like The Pizza Cupcake reach customers and get a great return on their investment. We're doing this through investments in machine learning and monetization of newer surfaces like Stories and Reels. In all of this, we're planning for the long term. 
Mark talked about some of the key elements of our strategy going forward. So I'll focus on the strategy for the ads business. If you think about the journey we've been on over the past decade or so, we started with desktop ads on the right-hand side of people's feeds. Then consumers shifted to mobile, and we put ads in News Feed. And quarter after quarter, year after year, as we've created great new consumer products like Stories or Reels, we found the right way for advertisers to reach consumers within these products. And we're constantly working to make our ads deliver more for businesses and be more relevant for people. 
To support the growth of our ads business over the next 10 years, it's going to take a similar effort. We need to build on our success by developing innovative new products and discovery experiences while giving everyone more control over their personal information. 
To build the next era of personalized experiences, we're focused on product innovations in 4 areas. The first is discovery. We want to keep making our app the best places to discover products and businesses you'll love. For example, we're testing a new experience in News Feed where you can tap to browse content from businesses on topics like beauty, fitness or clothing. And we're using context to make smarter recommendations about which ads to show. So if you're watching a travel video, we could show ads for hotels and flights. 
The second area is commerce, which Mark touched on a moment ago. We're building a modern commerce system across ads, community tools, messaging, shops and payments. It's all about creating a personalized, seamless customer journey where it's easier to discover products, buy it, pay for it and have it delivered to your doorstep. 
The third area is privacy-enhancing technologies. We know businesses are experiencing challenges because of platform changes. We want to make sure they can continue getting great results through privacy-safe, personalized ads long into the future. So we're collaborating across the industry to develop new technologies to help minimize the amount of personal information we process while still allowing us to show relevant ads and measure their effectiveness. 
The fourth is building tools that help businesses beyond marketing. We want to help solve all kinds of business needs, whether it's customer relationship management, business messaging tools or hiring through Facebook jobs. 
We're helping people run their business across our apps easily with Facebook Business Suite. We're making it easier to message customers across our apps from a single interface. And we're expanding our Messenger API for Instagram as customers increasingly rely on messaging instead of phone calls. 
The digital transformation is a long-term trend that isn't going away. By focusing on innovation in these 4 areas, we will continue to help businesses of all sizes make the shift online and reach customers with privacy-safe, personalized advertising. 
As ever, I'm grateful to all the businesses who work with us, and I continue to be amazed by our teams all over the world. Throughout this period, we've been really lucky to have so many brilliant people working hard to keep people connected and help businesses survive and thrive online. 
Now over to Dave."

We delivered strong results in the second quarter as our services continue to help millions of businesses reach customers around the world. Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approxim",1037,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 
We delivered strong results in the second quarter as our services continue to help millions of businesses reach customers around the world. Let's begin with our community metrics. 
We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least 1 of our services on a daily basis in June and that approximately 3.5 billion people used at least 1 on a monthly basis. Our global community continue to grow even as we lapped elevated user growth in the second quarter of last year related to the pandemic. 
Facebook daily active users reached 1.91 billion, up 7% or 123 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.9 billion monthly active users in June. MAUs grew by 194 million or 7% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $29.1 billion, up 56% or 50% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind. And had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 of last year, total revenue would have been $982 million lower. On a 2-year basis, Q2 total revenue growth decelerated to 72% from 74% in the first quarter. 
Q2 ad revenue was $28.6 billion, up 56% or 51% on a constant currency basis. The macroeconomic environment for online advertising remains very strong. As Sheryl noted, the growth in the advertising revenue was largely driven by verticals that have performed well during the pandemic such as online commerce and consumer packaged goods. In addition, we have -- we saw improved growth trends in verticals that were particularly challenged during the pandemic, such as travel, entertainment and media. 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions as we lapped the strongest quarter of last year, this is the second quarter of last year, which was the period hardest hit by the pandemic. Growth was strongest in the Rest of World at 86%. Europe, Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada grew 63%, 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of World, all benefited from currency tailwinds. 
In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 47%. Impression growth was primarily driven by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific, while pricing growth benefited from broad-based strength in advertiser demand. Recall that in the second quarter of 2020, the effects of the pandemic contributed to elevated impressions and depressed prices, which we are now lapping. 
Other revenue was $497 million, up 36%. Other revenue growth continues to be driven by Quest 2 sales, though the rate of growth slowed in the second quarter as we entered a seasonally slower sales period. We also recorded a revenue adjustment for returns related to the Quest 2 foam facial interface recall. 
Turning now to expenses. Q2 total expenses were $16.7 billion, up 31% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items: cost of revenue increased 41% driven by consumer hardware costs, payments partners and core infrastructure investments. R&D increased 37%, driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 15%, mainly driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 23% driven mostly by employee-related costs and legal expenses. 
We added over 2,700 net new hires in Q2, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 63,400 full-time employees, up 21% compared to last year. Second quarter operating income was $12.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $10.4 billion or $3.61 per share. Capital expenditures, including capital leases, were $4.7 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $7.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with $64.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
In terms of our sustainability efforts, we remain focused on achieving our goal to reach net zero emissions for our entire value chain in 2030. In June, we released our second annual sustainability report, which details our work towards achieving our objectives. 
Turning now to the outlook. Similar to the second quarter, we expect that advertising revenue growth will be primarily driven by year-over-year advertising price increases during the rest of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. When viewing growth on a 2-year basis to exclude the impacts from lapping the COVID recovery, we expect [ year -- over 2-year ] total revenue growth rates to decelerate modestly in the second half compared to the second quarter rate. 
We continue to expect increasing ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a more significant impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. As noted in recent earnings calls, we continue to monitor developments related -- regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. 
Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven primarily by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure and consumer hardware-related costs. Our expenses -- our expense outlook reflects our commitment to invest ahead of the compelling long-term growth opportunities we see across our product portfolio. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We expect our full year 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. 
In closing, we are pleased with the strong performance of our business and remain committed to innovating on behalf of the people and businesses who use our services around the world. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

Talk to us about sort of what are 1 or 2 of the key execution areas you really need to overcome to make the shopping opportunity really be larger for the company over the next few years. 
And then secondly, on the creator economy, there's a lot of different platforms with reach and algorithms sort of attacking this creator economy. Maybe just help us better understand a little bit the way you intend to really compete for creators to bring more exclusive content to your platform."
20765463,1672792639,2353513,"Facebook, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. On commerce, I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the ads business is so large that it's going to take a long time before anything that we do with commerce is going to be particularly meaningful a",722,"Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. On commerce, I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the ads business is so large that it's going to take a long time before anything that we do with commerce is going to be particularly meaningful at scale. But I think overall, the strategy is really to work our way down the funnel from discovery and all the things that were already world-class that -- with ads to making it so that those ads increasingly point to shops across our different services. In order to do that, each layer of the funnel that we're working on, we want to be world class on its own, which means that basically, there's this whole long tail of functionality that businesses have come to expect on the web and from other tools, and we need to make sure that, that's available for shops and business messaging and all the tools, whether we do that through partnerships with other e-commerce companies or building it up ourselves. 
So it's -- we're seeing meaningful improvements every quarter in this in terms of how effective these are. There are already a pretty meaningful number of merchants and people who are using Shops, and we expect this to compound over the coming years. But I just think in terms of the scale of the ads business that we're starting at, I just think realistically, we shouldn't expect that this is going to be a meaningful driver of our business or profitability in the near term. It's just going to take a while for that compounding to become meaningful numbers. 
But I think the strategy is the right one. It's creating a better product experience for people. When you click on an ad or when you engage with a business, it's just going to be much better to do that natively, whether you're in Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp or whatever you're using, than go to a website that doesn't have your payment information and it isn't personalized. So I think we're on the right path here, and we're focused on compounding this as quickly as we can. 
I guess for the second question on the creator economy, I mean, yes, there are a number of different companies that are focused on this. I'd say there are a couple of things here that are interesting properties of this. One is that if you're a creator and you're trying to get your content out there and you're trying to make a living, you want to be in all these different platforms. So I think a lot of what we're trying to do is it's not necessarily the case that people are going to be on one platform versus another. We just want to make it so that the creators have their best content here and that we can help them make a living better than other platforms. And we think that if we do, we'll have an advantage on content over the long term. But it's not like we fundamentally have to win creators over from another place. 
Our monetization tools, I think, are a pretty big advantage that we bring to the table. Our advertising is world-class. So the ability to basically help creators make more money from the work that they're already doing, I think it's something that we should really be able to bring those set of tools to the table. We also have a lot of distribution that -- and ability to -- for people to find their communities and help personalize recommendations to help connect people with the people who are going to be interested in their content. 
So I bet that is -- that's some of what we're seeing and why a lot of creators are excited about the work that we're doing. And over the long term, I think if we're able to make it so that millions of creators are able to make a living across our platforms, I think that that's just going to mean that there's going to be a long-term breadth and healthy set of content across the systems that I think is going to be increasingly important, especially as video becomes more important on our platforms, like what we're seeing both with Watch and Reels now."

And I'd say in North America, given our high level of penetration, we do expect sort of MAU and DAU levels to sort of bounce around from quarter-to-quarter given kind of how significantly penetrated we are in that market. 
And then in Europe, we're seeing a combination of seasonal slowness as well as COVID-related softness when we saw restriction ease -- restrictions ease. Obviously, with Delta, we might see other trends. It's hard to predict how that's going to play out in this cycle. But that's kind of the best read on it I can give you at this point."

And on the metaverse point, what we're primarily focused on here, before I get into the business model, our basic playbook as a company is build products that get to scale, especially social products. It's important that the people you want to interact with are there. So we're going to focus on having hundreds of millions of people use the metaverse and the new platforms that we're building before we really turn this into what I expect to be a very important and big part of the business. 
But overall -- and I think that there's -- as we embark on this next chapter, ads are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do, and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse, too. I think commerce is going to be increasingly important, which is why we're -- one of the reasons why we're focused on this across our current apps and the current economy. But I think digital goods and creators are just going to be huge, right, in terms of people expressing themselves through their avatars, through digital clothing, through digital goods, the apps that they have, that they bring with them from place to place. A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another. So being able to basically have your digital goods and your inventory and bring them from place to place, I think that's going to be a big investment that people make. 
And our focus for now is really on helping to develop the community, helping to develop the number of people who -- and grow the number of people who can be in these metaverse experiences and can experience in these next computing platforms like virtual and augmented reality. And that's, I think, what you should expect us to focus on over the next period. But over the long term, I think that there's going to be a very big digital economy around this. And that's what we're primarily going to be shooting for. 
Our business model isn't going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible. So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. 
So that's kind of at a high level how I'm thinking about this. And I'm happy to talk about this more as we continue to evolve the investment. And Dave can speak about the expenses and disclosures and all that. But I will note that I appreciate the ingenuity and cleverness of looking to our job descriptions to -- just to see where we're investing. This is a big focus, as I called out in my comments at the beginning."

In terms of impression growth, we had called out last quarter that we would expect for the remainder of 2021 for pricing to be a bigger driver of growth. So -- and mentioned at that time, there were a few factors driving it. The biggest factor is lapping the COVID engagement that we saw that was particularly pronounced in North America where we saw more engagement related to the lockdowns and higher impression growth last year. So that is one of the big factors. 
The other factor that we're seeing is a shift towards video, both for our products and other products. And that's just generally a big trend in the market, and that tends to have a -- lower impressions per the amount of engagement than things like News Feed. So kind of both those things are factors, but the COVID factor is the one that I would call out. 
And when you think about how we're expanding services to create more ad inventory, I would say that we've got a number of impression growth opportunities. We've seen growing impression contributions from new services like Instagram Explore broadly within video, Marketplace. And then when we look forward, I think Reels is a really significant future opportunity. We've only just really begun to make ads available globally on Reels. 
So when you kind of look at all of these different services, we think there are a lot of good growth opportunities. They're still small in absolute size compared to things like Feed and Stories, but big opportunities for growth. 
In terms of your question on ATT, so the impact from the ATT changes has really generally been in line with our expectation. We're obviously benefiting, as others are, from a very strong macro environment for advertising. But look, this has been very challenging for advertisers to navigate, and we're working with them to help them navigate these changes. And we've introduced solutions to help them do that through approaches like our Aggregated Events Management API, which is aggregated data for targeting and measurement. Obviously, we're doing a lot of work on using machine learning and AI to help rank apps and make them more valuable. But overall, we do think there are opportunities to continue to improve our capabilities through investments in areas like machine learning and AI to make ads more effective. And if we can get advertisers to get the same number of conversions from fewer ads, that's great. That works for them, and it creates more value for the ads for us. 
Okay, France, we can go to the next question."

And then given the rise in pricing, just to address the issue. I know you've done it in the past, the extent to which that's had a material impact on ROI for marketers. I know it's an auction-based system. But as prices rise, is there -- should -- is there any reason to be concerned about whether there will be some marketers that would be priced out because of that and create less optimal outcomes for your platform?"

Once you are really incentivized within an auction to find the thing that is returning for you, that's actually almost always the thing that is the most relevant for people who are seeing the ads. And I think that's been a good system and good pressure within the system going forward. 
We're certainly seeing our large brand advertisers continue to spend and get better at using personalization in our ad formats. And we're seeing small advertisers be able to compete very effectively. Doesn't mean that rising prices aren't an issue sometimes. But I think overall, this is where the auction system serves us well and most importantly, serves consumers well."

Just wondering how you kind of look at that. 
And then maybe Dave or maybe Sheryl, I was -- I want to go back to the impact of iOS 14.5 on target in general, but maybe DR in particular.

I do think that this is going to be a macro wave overall that a lot of companies are going to be able to ride and benefit from. So whether that's companies like NVIDIA that are building a lot of the graphics chips that are going to be really important for a lot of the content that I think is going to be increasingly graphically intense, that's -- certainly, building those kind of graphics chips is not a thing that we're intending to get into. So we're certainly counting on companies like that in the industry to kind of continue improving and compounding overall. 
But on the hardware side, I would say that we have a pretty big program on building virtual and augmented reality devices. And I mean sure, a lot of people are still going to be using phones and computers for a long time. But I think when it gets to what are the devices that are going to deliver the deepest sense of presence and that are going to be increasingly important over the next decade, we're certainly investing in that because we want to make sure that those develop in a way that's in line with the vision of these platforms helping people to interact with each other and socialize. And that means prioritizing certain feature development or certain sensors in the devices that we want to make sure that we can help push that in a direction that will help leave these to become a very social platform. 
So overall, I do think this is going to be a big space. The point that I was making is that I think there are going to be a lot of winners. And there's -- and this is going to be not something that one company builds alone, but I think it is going to be a whole ecosystem that needs to develop. But we're certainly making a lot of the key investments that we need to make in the foundational technology to be able to deliver the parts that we want to."

Maybe a couple of higher-level questions, really coming out of F8 refresh.

So in terms of messaging, we're working on cross-app communication between them, business messaging APIs. I mean a lot of this is very much -- the business messaging, I think, is going to be an important part of commerce and helping people interact with businesses in a way that is natural to them. The cross-app communication in terms of helping people reach people wherever they are, it kind of fits into this vision that we have for the future of people being able to easily teleport between experiences that I think is going to be increasingly important as we move towards the metaverse. People are going to need messaging services, they're -- that's going to continue to be a core way that people communicate. People are going to want to reach the people they care about no matter what service they're on and be able to move between these. 
So when I talk about kind of interoperability and moving more there in the future, we're trying to get our core experiences today aligned with that as well. The other thing I'd say on messaging is -- the connect to the business today is that click-to-messaging ads are one of the parts of the ad business that is growing quickly and doing quite well. And part of that is because even if we're not charging a lot directly for the messaging APIs for businesses that if the interactions between people and businesses end up helping businesses convert better and drive more sales, then business is naturally going to want to pay to have their ads point towards that rather than other services that we may not control or that may be a worse experience. So that's on the messaging side. 
On the AI side, I think this is a really good question. It's probably something that doesn't come up as much on these earnings calls is it probably should for how important of a driver of the progress in AI is for our overall results. One of the things that I've observed in just running the business over the last couple of years is there's a lot of focus on kind of different headwinds that we may face, whether it's from other platforms or regulation or different things. 
But one of the areas that I think has routinely outperformed our expectations is progress on AI. And we don't have a single product, which is like an AI product that's sort of the embodiment of all the AI work. That's not something that we've done yet. But we basically -- we have a very large investment in AI and we build out this platform that then all of our products use. So when we make foundational improvements, it makes ranking better in News Feed and in Reels and in ads, and it makes our spam detection and our integrity systems more effective at identifying stuff. Everything just gets better. And this has really been one of the big tailwinds or waves that we've been riding. 
And just from what I can see technologically on the horizon, it really doesn't seem like this is going to be slowing down anytime soon. And I don't think that this is a Facebook-specific thing. I think that this is probably across the whole industry or maybe even across the whole economy more broadly. But I do think that the progress that's being made at the fundamental levels with AI is driving a lot of progress and is one of the important macro effects that we're seeing. 
For PyTorch specifically, I mean it certainly helps that the framework that we use to develop our AI work is one that's embraced by the community. So a lot of times when we go to spin up a new project, it's -- there will already have been some team that contributed an open-source library to it, and that makes it easy. So I think that there certainly are dividends that we get from having developed or helped develop PyTorch to become an increasing standard, especially among researchers. And it's certainly an area that we're going to focus on, on investing more in. I think that the core AI platform is just an important part of the progress that we're seeing overall."

We have 2 billion people watching in-stream ad eligible videos per month. 
Mobile-first video is increasing, meaning even brand advertisers are getting better at doing mobile-first video. And certainly, we think advertisers are looking for the best place to reach audiences, and we compare very favorably across the board. 
I'll share really, I think, a cool recent example. Walmart, a very -- a large advertiser, engaged Ree Drummond, who's The Pioneer Woman cooking show host, to host their first Live Shopping event. And the event was to launch her Walmart exclusive line of home and fashion products. And they used a mix of our personal ads to drive awareness to a Live Shopping event and then reengaged with viewers after the purchase, and they had really great results across the board. They ran part of that live as video ads and resulted in thousands of engagements, a lot of engagement with people and sales. 
And so I think that's a good example of our products like Live, combined with the use of video on our platform, combined with people taking an opportunity for video ads and putting it all together in ways I think will compete very favorably with older formats like TV."

I don't have specific data to share, but I mean I -- just contextually, the work that we're doing with the Aggregated Events Management API is part of the broader work that we're doing to rebuild meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system can continue to perform while having access to less data in the future. And it really dovetails into some of the work that Mark was talking about with machine learning and AI because that's going to be an important part of being able to make better use of less data. And so again, why having access to the ML and AI capabilities that we have with Facebook are -- is going to be so important to the future and maintaining and growing the efficacy of ads. 
So I think broadly, we're pleased with the progress we're making on this. It is disruptive for advertisers to have to go through the process of also learning how to retool.

We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities, and our community continues to grow.

We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities, and our community continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use one or more of our services, and I'm excited about our road map to keep building great new experiences for them. 
As expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that are not only negatively affecting our business, but millions of small businesses and what is already a difficult time for them in the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later, but the bottom line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're already making today. 
Before I get to our product update, I want to discuss the recent debate around our company. I believe large organizations should be [ screwed ]. So I much rather live in a society where they are, the one where they can't be. Good thing, criticism helps us get better. But my view is that what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use lease documents to pay a false picture of our company. The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us. We have industry-leading programs to study the effects of our products and provide transparency to our progress because we care about getting this right. 
When we make decisions, we need to balance competing social activities like free expression with reducing harmful content or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement or enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible. It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't sell these impossible trade-offs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business but about balancing different difficult social values. 
And I've repeatedly called for regulation to provide clarity because I don't think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves. I'm proud of our record navigating the complex trade-offs involved in operating services at global scale, and I am proud of the research and transparency we bring to our work. Our programs are industry-leading. We have made massive investments in safety and security with more than 40,000 people, and we are on track to spend more than $5 billion on safety and security in 2021. I believe that's more than any other tech company even adjusted for scale. 
We set the standard for transparency with our quarterly enforcement reports and tools like [indiscernible] archive. We established a new model for independent academic researchers to safely access data. We pioneered the Oversight Board as a model of self-regulation. And as a result, we believe that our systems are the most effective at reducing harmful content across the industry. And I think that any honest account of how we handle these issues should include that. I also think that any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media. That means that no matter what Facebook does, we're never going to sell them on our own. 
For example, polarization started rising in the U.S. before it is born. At the same time, independent research shows that many countries around the world have flat or declining polarization despite similar social media use there in the U.S. We see this pattern repeat with other issues as well. The reality is that social media is not the main driver of these issues and probably can't fix them by itself either. 
We should want every other company in our industry to make the investments and achieve the results that we have. I worry about the incentives that we are creating for other companies to be as introspective as we have been, but I am committed to continuing this work because I believe it will be better for our community and our business over the long term. 
Now we can't change the underlying media dynamics, but there is a different constituency that we serve that has always been more important and that I try to keep us focused. And that's people. Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people you care about, to find communities that matter to you and to grow your small business. And the reason we've been able to succeed for almost 2 decades is because we keep evolving and building. 
Facebook started in the dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile-first experience. And then we grew a whole family of apps that serve billions of people. And there is so much more to build. 
Even with all of the tools that we have today, we still can feel like we're right there together with the people we care about when we're physically apart. We can't teleport these holograms to instantly be at the office without a compute or at a concert with a friend or in your parents' living room to catch up. The creative economy and commerce tools are so nascent, and there should be opportunity for millions of more people to make a living doing the work that they love. 
Our 3 product priorities remain our focus on creators, commerce and building the next computing platform. A big part of our work with creators is our focus on Reels. Reels is already the primary driver of engagement growth lines. It's incredibly entertaining, and I think that there is a huge amount of potential ahead. We expect this to continue growing, and I am optimistic that Reels will be as important for our product as Stories is. We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience. 
One aspect of this is giving all our apps the goal of being the best services for young adults, which we define as ages 18 to 29. Historically, young adults have been a strong base, and that's important because they are the future. But over the last decade, as the audience that uses our apps has expanded so much and we focused on serving everyone, our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them rather than specifically for young adults. And during this period, competition has also gotten a lot more intense, especially with Apple's iMessage growing in popularity and, more recently, the rise of TikTok, which is one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced. 
So we are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people. Like everything, this will involve trade-offs in our products, and it will likely mean that the rest of our community will grow more slowly than it otherwise would have. But it should also mean that our services become stronger for young adults. This shift will take years, not months, to fully execute, and I think it's the right approach to building our community and company for the long term. 
Our next product priority is commerce. Helping people discover new products that they're interested in and reach customers inside our apps is going to unlock a lot of opportunities. As Apple's changes, make e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that allow businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important to them. We built solutions like ads that can dynamically point to either a business' website or their shop on our platform, depending on what will perform better for them. And that will help more businesses navigate this challenging dynamic environment. 
Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multiyear journey. Marketplace is already at scale, and lots of people rely on it, especially now with supply chain issues that make it harder to get new products. Shops are getting more developed, and we have an exciting program planned for this holiday season where we're working closely with a number of the businesses that have invested the most in shops to identify what works to find new customers and grow their businesses even faster. And our plan is to then scale those solutions more broadly in 2022. 
Beyond Reels and Commerce, I also want to share some thoughts on our longer-term efforts to build the next computing platform and help bring the metaverse to life. This is a major area of investment for us and an important part of our strategy going forward. 
And I think this work is critical to our mission because delivering a sense of presence, like you're right there with another person, that's the holy grail of online and social experience. Over the next decade, these new platforms are going to start to unlock the kinds of experiences that I wanted to build since before I even started Facebook. Along with those social experiences, I expect a massive increase in the creator economy and amount of digital goods and commerce. 
If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll need digital clothes and digital tools and different experiences. Our goal is to help the members reach 1 billion people and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce [indiscernible]. And strategically, helping to shape the next platform should also reduce our dependence on delivering our services for competitors. 
Building the foundational platform for the metaverse will be a long road. We just released the 128-gigabyte Quest 2, replacing a 64-gigabyte model for 2 99. With EssilorLuxottica, we released our first smart glasses, and they are off to a strong start as well. But bringing this vision to life isn't just about building one glass of product. There's a whole ecosystem. We're building multiple generations of our VR and AR products at the same time as well as a new operating system, a development model, a digital commerce platform, content studio and, of course, a social platform. 
So to reflect the significance of this for our business, today, we are announcing a change to our financial reporting. Starting next quarter, we will begin disclosing financial metrics for Facebook Reality Labs separately from our Family of Apps. And this will provide investors with additional visibility into the investments that we're making in augmented and virtual reality. 
In 2021, we expect these investments to reduce our overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and I expect this investment to grow even further for each of the next several years. David will share more about this later, but I encourage you all to tune in to Connect on Thursday to hear more about our vision and our work here in more detail. 
I recognize the magnitude of the spec on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors, the creative community and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our company to bring this inspiring future [indiscernible]. 
And with that, here's Sheryl."
20765463,1684382806,2411960,"Facebook, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2021",2021-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions, and we continue to grow our user base. We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want",1107,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions, and we continue to grow our user base. 
We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want to explain some of the revenue softness we've seen and what we're doing to mitigate the headwinds and help businesses over the crucial holiday period and beyond. 
To start, let's take a step back. Over the past decade, we've seen more and more businesses shift online. When the pandemic hit, this digital transformation accelerated. We've invested in tools and products over many years to help businesses make this [indiscernible]. So this acceleration drove very strong growth for us throughout the last few quarters. 
We've been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming, and we've experienced that in Q3. The biggest is the impact of Apple iOS 14 changes, which has created headwinds for others in the industry as well, major challenges for small businesses and advantaged Apple's advertising business. We started to see that impact in Q2, but adoption on the consumer side ramped up by late June, so it hit critical mass in Q3. 
As a result, we've encountered 2 challenges. One is that the accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes for our advertisers; and the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult. 
On targeting, we focused on improving campaign performance even with the increased limitations facing our industry. We're building commerce tools to help businesses reach more new customers and get more incremental sales. And over the longer term, we're developing privacy-enhancing technologies in collaboration with others across the industry to help minimize the amount of personal information we process while still allowing us to show relevant ads. Progress in these areas will take time and will be a focus for us throughout 2022 and beyond. 
On measurement, as we wrote in a recent blog post, we believe we are underreporting iOS web conversions. This means real-world conversions like sales and app install are higher than what's being reported from many advertisers, especially small advertisers. We're making good progress fixing this. We think we'll be able to address more than half of the underreporting by the end of this year, and we'll continue to work on this into 2022. 
Another external factor is slowing e-commerce risk. The strong e-commerce growth in recent quarters was driven in part by the acceleration of the digital transformation that has now tapered out. I think most people see this in their own lives. There is a period of time when many people who are able to stay at home and ordered things online much more. But now in many places, things have opened up, and people are increasingly making purchases in person. This doesn't mean e-commerce has stopped growing. Businesses are still making the shift online, but e-commerce is no longer growing at the pace it was at the height of the pandemic. 
These factors have been compounded from many advertisers by major global supply chain issues and labor shortages, which have lost many consumer businesses with less inventory. This has reduced their appetite to generate demand from consumers, which has impacted advertising spend. Businesses in every region and across a range of verticals have been affected. At the same time, we've also seen some impact from COVID surges around the world in places like Southeast Asia. 
Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's iOS 14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. And while we and our advertisers will continue to feel the effect of these changes in future quarters, we will continue working hard to mitigate them. 
Despite the headwinds, we remain confident about our future. We believe Facebook and Instagram are the best place for people to connect with their friends and families, build communities and starting to grow businesses. And we believe they're still the best platform for advertisers to reach people where they are and get measurable outcomes. Our focus remains where it has always been, building products that help people connect and businesses grow. 
Mark talked about video a moment ago. Not only is this a growing area for us overall, but we're also continuing to get better at monetizing it. More than 60% of video revenue now comes from mobile-served video, meaning videos that are shot vertically or are under 15 seconds. Over 2 billion people per month now watch videos that are eligible for in-stream ads, which are as shown before, during or after videos. And we're expanding access to Reels adds on Instagram to more advertisers with automatic placement in new creative formats. 
Another area we're seeing good progress is in lead generation. Our products helped businesses generate quality leads at scale and meet customers where they are in their preferred channel of communication, whether it's messaging, forms or calls. In April, we started rolling out a new conversion leads optimization goal for higher quality leads. And advertisers can also integrate their CRM with Facebook via our conversions API. Our tests show that on average, advertisers see a 20% increase in lead to sales conversion rate when they use both the optimization [indiscernible] and the integration. 
Q4 is the most important quarter of the year for many businesses, large and small. As always, we're focused on making the holiday season a success for them. We're working to fix the measurement issues they are experiencing and deliver the tools and products they need to grow. And we're rolling out a range of holiday shopping experiences to help people find great deals, support small businesses and good causes and shop with local and black owned businesses. 
We're bringing exclusive gifts to shops that will be available when people check out on Facebook or Instagram, like 20% off your first purchase and free shipping. Starting next week, we'll host daily live shopping experiences with companies large and small, brands like Walmart, Macy's, Benefit Cosmetics and Paint Box Nail to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals. And we're bringing back one of my favorite campaigns ever by Black Friday to showcase black owned small businesses during the holidays. It includes things like buyback collections in the Facebook and Instagram Shop tab and a weekly buyback Friday show with live shopping segments from up and coming black owned small businesses. 
I want to close by saying how great I am to our partners around the world and to our incredible teams who are working so hard to help people and businesses throughout this period. 
Now here is Dave."
20765463,1684382806,2411960,"Facebook, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2021",2021-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of a challenging mobile platform landscape and an evolving macroeconomic environment. Let's begin with our community metrics. Our global community",1201,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of a challenging mobile platform landscape and an evolving macroeconomic environment. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. Our global community continued to grow, even as we lapped elevated user growth in the third quarter of last year related to the pandemic. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily business -- basis in September and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. 
Facebook daily active users reached 1.93 billion, up 6% or 110 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.91 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by 170 million or 6% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% or 34% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind, and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue would have been $259 million lower. Q3 ad revenue was $28.3 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. 
On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 50%. Europe, North America and Asia Pacific grew 35%, 31% and 28%, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of World benefited from currency tailwinds, though to a lesser degree than in the prior quarter. 
In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 9%, and the average price per ad increased 22%. Impression growth was driven primarily by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from advertiser demand and lapping COVID-related pricing weakness during the third quarter of last year, though, as Sheryl noted, growth was hindered by 3 primary headwinds. First, advertising spend was negatively impacted by performance and measurement headwinds related to Apple's ATT changes. Second, we are seeing some macro headwinds as growth in online commerce has moderated from the elevated levels experienced earlier in the pandemic and businesses faced supply chain disruptions. Third, COVID resurgences in Southeast Asia have led to additional lockdowns and the curtailment of economic activity. Other revenue was $734 million, up 195% driven by strong Quest 2 sales. 
Turning now to expenses. Q3 total expenses were $18.6 [ million ], up 38% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 38% driven mostly by consumer hardware costs, core infrastructure investments and payments to partners. R&D increased 33% driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 32%, mainly driven by marketing spend and higher rate. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 65% driven primarily by higher legal-related costs and employee-related costs. 
We added over 4,700 net new hires in Q3 primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 68,100 full-time employees, up 28% -- up 20% compared to last year. Third quarter operating income was $10.4 billion, representing a 36% operating margin. Our tax rate was 13%. Net income was $9.2 billion or $3.22 per share. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $4.5 billion driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $9.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased $14.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $8 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of September 30. Today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Turning now to the outlook. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to break out Facebook Reality Labs, or FRL, as a separate reporting segment. As we have discussed, we are dedicating significant resources towards our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our work to develop the next generation of online social experiences. The new segment disclosures will provide additional information on the performance of FRL and the investments we are making. 
Under this reporting structure, we will provide revenue and operating profit for 2 segments. The first segment, Family of Apps, will include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services. The second segment, Facebook Reality Labs, will include augmented and virtual reality-related hardware, software and content. As Mark noted, we expect our investment in FRL to reduce our overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life, and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years. 
Ahead of the fourth quarter earnings call, we will share additional details about the reporting format of our segmented financials. 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2021 total revenue to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we faced in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2 during last year's holiday shopping season. As previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. 
Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $71 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $70 billion to $73 billion. We anticipate our full year 2022 total expenses will be in the range of $91 billion to $97 billion driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $19 billion to $21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion driven by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. A large factor driving the increase in CapEx spend is an investment in our AI and machine learning capabilities, which we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products, including in feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance. 
We expect our Q4 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we would expect our full year tax rate in 2022 to be similar to the full year 2021 rate. Please note that our outlook for 2022 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2022 budget. 
In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business despite facing some headwinds, and we believe the investments we're making in our current services as well as new products and experiences will enable us to remain the best place for people to connect and for businesses to advertise both now and in the years ahead. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

Sure, Brian. On Reels, that's been a bright spot for Instagram. And currently, we're seeing good growth globally -- strength in a number of different markets, but we've been making a lot of progress on Reels and have been happy with it on Instagram. 
In terms of launch on Facebook, that's earlier stage. On the monetization front, we're just starting to roll out ads in Instagram. So it's earlier on that front, and we really haven't gotten to a monetization point with Reels on Facebook. 
Sheryl, do you want to take the iOS 14 question?"
20765463,1684382806,2411960,"Facebook, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2021",2021-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I can take that.

And we think they're better for people and businesses, and they're especially important to small businesses. They also can be delivered, can be done in a very privacy safe way. 
There are 2 big challenges coming from this iOS changes. The one is targeting and one is measurement. I'm taking the second one first. On measurement, we think we can address more than half of that underreporting by the end of the year and make more progress in the years ahead. We estimate we're underreporting iOS web conversions. We believe that real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher. And so we have to do the work to help clients measure these properly in order for them to really understand the outcomes they're getting and improving performance. And again, we think we can get a good chunk of that then this year and more in the next year. 
Targeting is a longer-term challenge. Our direct response products are built on user level conversions. And as a result of the iOS changes, we don't see the same level of conversion data coming through. So we have to rebuild our targeting and optimization systems to work with less data. So this is a multiyear effort. We are developing privacy-enhancing technology to minimize the amount of personal information. We learn and using more aggregate or anonymized data while still allowing us to show those relevant personalized ads and measure ads effectiveness.

So for the next 1 and 3 years, especially, I think what you'll see is us putting more of the foundational pieces into place. This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in the near future. But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the mobile Internet, that it's going to enable social experiences that are the ultimate expression of what we try to build, which is allowing people to feel really present with the people they care about no matter where they actually are. And we think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical goods than what exists today and allow millions of people to be able to do work doing what they love and enabling a whole different economy around that, that I think is going to be another important pillar of our business. over the next decade. 
So on the next 1 to 3 years, I mean, I almost -- I wouldn't focus on the sort of business outcomes there quite as much as I would just -- there's a product to the infrastructure that we're putting in place. So there's -- they're a new platform is there's hardware components. There's the whole virtual reality product line. There's the augmented reality product line. We're kind of starting to put those pieces in place. There's the operating system and development model for all these new creative tools. There's the commerce parts of what we're doing around this and how they tie into broad commerce effort across Family of Apps. 
And then there's all the social platform work that we're doing with our Horizon effort that touches a bunch of different areas of what we're doing. But I think you'll see all of those pieces start to built out and start to mature a bit over the next few years. And then if we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade, this one we would sort of expect this to be more of a real business story. 
But I think what we kind of think about for the near term is are we delivering the product experiences that are completely groundbreaking and that people try this, and they just think this is amazing and can see a glimpse of where this is going, and that will pave the way for the future the sort of the business North Star that I mentioned in some of my opening remarks, we hope that by the end of the decade that we can

I think you're right, this is going to be a critical part of at least our platform and the work that we're doing here. We released workrooms recently. I'm really excited about how that experience has come together. And I think to your point, you mentioned it's important to have a VR social experience.

It needs to be able to work across our whole Family of Apps. It needs to be able to work on the web and on phones and on computers. So there's a lot to do. 
And whether we call it beta or not, I think the reality is we're going to be -- this is kind of similar to the question before about where we're going to be in a year or 3 years.

We issued these quarterly transparency reports, which I should add we're industry-leading on this in both in terms of defining this and in terms of the depth of what we outlined that people can hold us accountable and kind of see the breakdown of how we're actually doing. But what we measure in those reports and disclosed is what percent of the content that we act on is our AI or our internal systems finding rather than people having to report it because we have a lot of people, right? We use our products if they find something that's problematic and they report stuff to us. And it used to be before the last several years that most of what we did for community integrity was just respond to incoming reports, but we decided, hey, we should really try to get in front of this and build really sophisticated systems that we're not just relying on people to tell us when there are issues, but we can proactively go address that. 
And in most of these categories and we've basically gotten to the point now where 90-plus percent of the content were basically -- that's that we act on. We're identifying largely through the AI system, and it varies a bit by category. So for categories like [ nudity ] where relatively, it's easier train a computer to identify that. The numbers are very high. Some of the categories like hate speech that have been harder because, first of all, we're operating in I think it's around 150 languages around the world. I also think it's -- there's a lot of cultural nuance in this where you want to be able to make sure you understand the new ends and all those languages and that you want to make sure that people can say [indiscernible], right? If someone is saying something races to encourage someone to do something hateful, that's bad. But if you -- if someone wants to basically say, hey, I saw this person doing this and people shouldn't be doing that, and you don't want to sense of people doing that. 
So it is being a very challenging problem. And for the first couple of years of working on this, we're still at a relatively low recall rate where our AI systems had 10%, 15% of the content that we were addressing -- we were dealing with proactively. But in recent years, the AI progress has been very impressive. We're now above 90% of the content that we take an action on there, is also proactive even with hate speech. 
So overall -- I mean, look, let me take this question in a slightly different direction, which is I know that there is a lot of scrutiny of our efforts. And I guess I just want to say to the team and the people who work on this that I'm really proud of the progress that they make. I think we have the best people in the world, and we're doing the best job of this, I believe, across any company in the industry. And I think this is an important area. There shouldn't be scrutiny on it, but I also think that any honest account of what's actually going on here should take into account that a huge amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made by a lot of talented people who are working on this."

In terms of Reels and other IG services, I can take a crack at that, and then Mark and Sheryl, want to add anything. Whenever we launch new experiences, this was true with Stories, it was true with Facebook Watch. It's -- you're always going to see some amount of shifting of people's time and attention to the new areas. And we do think that, that benefits the experience overall, and we think that makes the overall experience more engaging over time.

We believe we drive hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce gross merchandise volume today through our ads business. And we think commerce tools will be built and layered on top of that to help businesses reach more new customers and drive more incremental sales. 
In those commerce efforts, we're focused on 3 areas: continuing to be the best place to advertise, making it easier to sell on the platform and improving the customer experience. And I think we're in different places on those. In the first, in terms of continuing to be the best place to advertise, we are a great place to find customers. We think the ROI is very strong, and it continues to be competitive. 
In terms of making it easier, the second, to sell on the platform, here, we're catching up to other mobile and web shopping experiences. And I think we have some work to do there.

We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities, and our community continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use one or more of our services, and I'm excit",1885,"Hey, everyone, and thanks for joining today. We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities, and our community continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use one or more of our services, and I'm excited about our road map to keep building great new experiences for them.  
As expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that are not only negatively affecting our business, but millions of small businesses and what is already a difficult time for them in the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later, but the bottom line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're already making today.  
Before I get to our product update, I want to discuss the recent debate around our company. I believe large organizations should be scrutinous. And I much rather live in a society where they are than one where they can't be. Good thing, criticism helps us get better. But my view is that what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use lease documents to pay a false picture of our company. The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us. We have industry-leading programs to study the effects of our products and provide transparency to our progress because we care about getting this right.  
When we make decisions, we need to balance competing social equities like free expression with reducing harmful content or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement or enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible. It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't sell these impossible trade-offs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business but about balancing different difficult social values.  
And I've repeatedly called for regulation to provide clarity because I don't think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves. I'm proud of our record navigating the complex trade-offs involved in operating services at global scale, and I am proud of the research and transparency we bring to our work. Our programs are industry-leading. We have made massive investments in safety and security with more than 40,000 people, and we are on track to spend more than $5 billion on safety and security in 2021. I believe that's more than any other tech company even adjusted for scale.  
We set the standard for transparency with our quarterly enforcement reports and tools like political ads archive. We established a new model for independent academic researchers to safely access data. We pioneered the Oversight Board as a model of self-regulation. And as a result, we believe that our systems are the most effective at reducing harmful content across the industry. And I think that any honest account of how we handle these issues should include that. I also think that any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media. That means that no matter what Facebook does, we're never going to sell them on our own.  
For example, polarization started rising in the U.S. before it is born. At the same time, independent research shows that many countries around the world have flat or declining polarization despite similar social media use there in the U.S. We see this pattern repeat with other issues as well. The reality is that social media is not the main driver of these issues and probably can't fix them by itself either.  
We should want every other company in our industry to make the investments and achieve the results that we have. I worry about the incentives that we are creating for other companies to be as introspective as we have been, but I am committed to continuing this work because I believe it will be better for our community and our business over the long term.  
Now we can't change the underlying media dynamics, but there is a different constituency that we serve that has always been more important and that I try to keep us focused. And that's people. Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people you care about, to find communities that matter to you and to grow your small business. And the reason we've been able to succeed for almost 2 decades is because we keep evolving and building.  
Facebook started in the dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile-first experience. And then we grew a whole Family of Apps that serve billions of people. And there is so much more to build.  
Even with all of the tools that we have today, we still can't feel like we're right there together with the people we care about when we're physically apart. We can't teleport these holograms to instantly be at the office without a compute or at a concert with a friend or in your parents' living room to catch up. The creative economy and commerce tools are so nascent, and there should be opportunity for millions of more people to make a living doing the work that they love.  
Our 3 product priorities remain our focus on creators, commerce and building the next computing platform. A big part of our work with creators is our focus on Reels. Reels is already the primary driver of engagement growth lines. It's incredibly entertaining, and I think that there is a huge amount of potential ahead. We expect this to continue growing, and I am optimistic that Reels will be as important for our product as Stories is. We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience.  
One aspect of this is giving all our apps the goal of being the best services for young adults, which we define as ages 18 to 29. Historically, young adults have been a strong base, and that's important because they are the future. But over the last decade, as the audience that uses our apps has expanded so much and we focused on serving everyone, our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them rather than specifically for young adults. And during this period, competition has also gotten a lot more intense, especially with Apple's iMessage growing in popularity and, more recently, the rise of TikTok, which is one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced.  
So we are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people. Like everything, this will involve trade-offs in our products, and it will likely mean that the rest of our community will grow more slowly than it otherwise would have. But it should also mean that our services become stronger for young adults. This shift will take years, not months, to fully execute, and I think it's the right approach to building our community and company for the long term.  
Our next product priority is Commerce. Helping people discover new products that they're interested in and reach customers inside our apps is going to unlock a lot of opportunities. As Apple's changes, make e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that allow businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important to them. We built solutions like ads that can dynamically point to either a business' website or their shop on our platform, depending on what will perform better for them. And that will help more businesses navigate this challenging dynamic environment.  
Building a full-fledged Commerce platform is a multiyear journey. Marketplace is already at scale, and lots of people rely on it, especially now with supply chain issues that make it harder to get new products. Shops are getting more developed, and we have an exciting program planned for this holiday season where we're working closely with a number of the businesses that have invested the most in shops to identify what works to find new customers and grow their businesses even faster. And our plan is to then scale those solutions more broadly in 2022.  
Beyond Reels and Commerce, I also want to share some thoughts on our longer-term efforts to build the next computing platform and help bring the metaverse to life. This is a major area of investment for us and an important part of our strategy going forward.  
And I think this work is critical to our mission because delivering a sense of presence, like you're right there with another person, that's the holy grail of online and social experience. Over the next decade, these new platforms are going to start to unlock the kinds of experiences that I wanted to build since before I even started Facebook. Along with those social experiences, I expect a massive increase in the creator economy and amount of digital goods and commerce.  
If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll need digital clothes and digital tools and different experiences. Our goal is to help the metaverse reach 1 billion people and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce a day. And strategically, helping to shape the next platform should also reduce our dependence on delivering our services for competitors.  
Building the foundational platform for the metaverse will be a long road. We just released the 128-gigabyte Quest 2, replacing a 64-gigabyte model for $299. With EssilorLuxottica, we released our first smart glasses, and they are off to a strong start as well. But bringing this vision to life isn't just about building one glass of product. There's a whole ecosystem. We're building multiple generations of our VR and AR products at the same time as well as a new operating system, a development model, a digital commerce platform, content studio and, of course, a social platform.  
So to reflect the significance of this for our business, today, we are announcing a change to our financial reporting. Starting next quarter, we will begin disclosing financial metrics for Facebook Reality Labs separately from our Family of Apps. And this will provide investors with additional visibility into the investments that we're making in augmented and virtual reality.  
In 2021, we expect these investments to reduce our overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and I expect this investment to grow even further for each of the next several years. David will share more about this later, but I encourage you all to tune in to Connect on Thursday to hear more about our vision and our work here in more detail.  
I recognize the magnitude of the spec on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors, the creative community and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our company to bring this inspiring future to. 
And with that, here's Sheryl."
20765463,1684382806,2412097,"Facebook, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2021",2021-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions, and we continue to grow our user base. We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want",1105,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions, and we continue to grow our user base. 
We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want to explain some of the revenue softness we've seen and what we're doing to mitigate the headwinds and help businesses over the crucial holiday period and beyond. 
To start, let's take a step back. Over the past decade, we've seen more and more businesses shift online. When the pandemic hit, this digital transformation accelerated. We've invested in tools and products over many years to help businesses make this shift. So this acceleration drove very strong growth for us throughout the last few quarters. 
We've been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming, and we've experienced that in Q3. The biggest is the impact of Apple iOS 14 changes, which has created headwinds for others in the industry as well, major challenges for small businesses and advantaged Apple's own advertising business. We started to see that impact in Q2, but adoption on the consumer side ramped up by late June, so it hit critical mass in Q3. 
As a result, we've encountered 2 challenges. One is that the accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes for our advertisers; and the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult. 
On targeting, we focused on improving campaign performance even with the increased limitations facing our industry. We're building commerce tools to help businesses reach more new customers and get more incremental sales. And over the longer term, we're developing privacy-enhancing technologies in collaboration with others across the industry to help minimize the amount of personal information we process while still allowing us to show relevant ads. Progress in these areas will take time and will be a focus for us throughout 2022 and beyond. 
On measurement, as we wrote in a recent blog post, we believe we are underreporting iOS web conversions. This means real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher than what's being reported from many advertisers, especially small advertisers. We're making good progress fixing this. We think we'll be able to address more than half of the underreporting by the end of this year, and we'll continue to work on this into 2022. 
Another external factor is slowing e-commerce growth. The strong e-commerce growth in recent quarters was driven in part by the acceleration of the digital transformation that is now tapering out. I think most people see this in their own lives. There is a period of time when many people who are able to stay at home and order things online much more. But now in many places, things have opened up, and people are increasingly making purchases in person. This doesn't mean e-commerce has stopped growing. Businesses are still making the shift online, but e-commerce is no longer growing at the pace it was at the height of the pandemic. 
These factors have been compounded from many advertisers by major global supply chain issues and labor shortages, which have lost many consumer businesses with less inventory. This has reduced their appetite to generate demand from consumers, which has impacted advertising spend. Businesses in every region and across a range of verticals have been affected. At the same time, we've also seen some impact from COVID surges around the world in places like Southeast Asia. 
Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's iOS 14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. And while we and our advertisers will continue to feel the effect of these changes in future quarters, we will continue working hard to mitigate them. 
Despite the headwinds, we remain confident about our future. We believe Facebook and Instagram are the best place for people to connect with their friends and families, build communities and starting to grow businesses. And we believe they're still the best platform for advertisers to reach people where they are and get measurable outcomes. Our focus remains where it has always been, building products that help people connect and businesses grow. 
Mark talked about video a moment ago. Not only is this a growing area for us overall, but we're also continuing to get better at monetizing it. More than 60% of video revenue now comes from mobile-first video, meaning videos that are shot vertically or are under 15 seconds. Over 2 billion people per month now watch videos that are eligible for in-stream ads, which are ad shown before, during or after videos. And we're expanding access to Reels ads on Instagram to more advertisers with automatic placement in new creative formats. 
Another area we're seeing good progress is in lead generation. Our products helped businesses generate quality leads at scale and meet customers where they are in their preferred channel of communication, whether it's messaging, forms or calls. In April, we started rolling out a new conversion leads optimization goal for higher quality leads. And advertisers can also integrate their CRM with Facebook via our conversions API. Our tests show that on average, advertisers see a 20% increase in lead to sales conversion rate when they use both the optimization goal and the integration. 
Q4 is the most important quarter of the year for many businesses, large and small. As always, we're focused on making the holiday season a success for them. We're working to fix the measurement issues they are experiencing and deliver the tools and products they need to grow. And we're rolling out a range of holiday shopping experiences to help people find great deals, support small businesses and good causes and shop with local and black-owned businesses. 
We're bringing exclusive gifts to shops that will be available when people check out on Facebook or Instagram, like 20% off your first purchase and free shipping. Starting next week, we'll host daily live shopping experiences with companies large and small, brands like Walmart, Macy's, Benefit Cosmetics and Paint Box Nail to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals. And we're bringing back one of my favorite campaigns ever by Black Friday to showcase black-owned small businesses during the holidays. It includes things like buyback collections in the Facebook and Instagram Shop tab and a weekly #BuyBlack Friday show with live shopping segments from up and coming black-owned small businesses. 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world and to our incredible teams who are working so hard to help people and businesses throughout this period. 
Now here is Dave."

We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of a challenging mobile platform landscape and an evolving macroeconomic environment. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. Our global community continued to grow, even as we lapped elevated user growth in the third quarter of last year related to the pandemic. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily business -- basis in September and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. 
Facebook daily active users reached 1.93 billion, up 6% or 110 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.91 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by 170 million or 6% compared to last year. 
Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% or 34% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind, and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue would have been $259 million lower. Q3 ad revenue was $28.3 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. 
On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 50%. Europe, North America and Asia Pacific grew 35%, 31% and 28%, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of World benefited from currency tailwinds, though to a lesser degree than in the prior quarter. 
In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 9%, and the average price per ad increased 22%. Impression growth was driven primarily by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from advertiser demand and lapping COVID-related pricing weakness during the third quarter of last year, though, as Sheryl noted, growth was hindered by 3 primary headwinds. First, advertising spend was negatively impacted by performance and measurement headwinds related to Apple's ATT changes. Second, we are seeing some macro headwinds as growth in online commerce has moderated from the elevated levels experienced earlier in the pandemic and businesses faced supply chain disruptions. Third, COVID resurgences in Southeast Asia have led to additional lockdowns and the curtailment of economic activity. Other revenue was $734 million, up 195% driven by strong Quest 2 sales. 
Turning now to expenses. Q3 total expenses were $18.6 billion, up 38% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 38% driven mostly by consumer hardware costs, core infrastructure investments and payments to partners. R&D increased 33% driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 32%, mainly driven by marketing spend and hiring. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 65% driven primarily by higher legal-related costs and employee-related costs. 
We added over 4,700 net new hires in Q3 primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 68,100 full-time employees, up 28% -- up 20% compared to last year. Third quarter operating income was $10.4 billion, representing a 36% operating margin. Our tax rate was 13%. Net income was $9.2 billion or $3.22 per share. 
Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $4.5 billion driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $9.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased $14.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $8 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of September 30. Today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Turning now to the outlook. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to break out Facebook Reality Labs, or FRL, as a separate reporting segment. As we have discussed, we are dedicating significant resources towards our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our work to develop the next generation of online social experiences. The new segment disclosures will provide additional information on the performance of FRL and the investments we are making. 
Under this reporting structure, we will provide revenue and operating profit for 2 segments. The first segment, Family of Apps, will include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services. The second segment, Facebook Reality Labs, will include augmented and virtual reality-related hardware, software and content. As Mark noted, we expect our investment in FRL to reduce our overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life, and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years. Ahead of the fourth quarter earnings call, we will share additional details about the reporting format of our segmented financials. 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2021 total revenue to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we faced in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2 during last year's holiday shopping season. As previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. 
Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $71 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $70 billion to $73 billion. We anticipate our full year 2022 total expenses will be in the range of $91 billion to $97 billion driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $19 billion to $21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion driven by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. A large factor driving the increase in CapEx spend is an investment in our AI and machine learning capabilities, which we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products, including in feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance. 
We expect our Q4 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we would expect our full year tax rate in 2022 to be similar to the full year 2021 rate. Please note that our outlook for 2022 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2022 budget. 
In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business despite facing some headwinds, and we believe the investments we're making in our current services as well as new products and experiences will enable us to remain the best place for people to connect and for businesses to advertise both now and in the years ahead. 
With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

And currently, we're seeing good growth globally -- strength in a number of different markets, but we've been making a lot of progress on Reels and have been happy with it on Instagram. 
In terms of launch on Facebook, that's earlier stage. On the monetization front, we're just starting to roll out ads in Instagram. So it's earlier on that front, and we really haven't gotten to a monetization point with Reels on Facebook. 
Sheryl, do you want to take the iOS 14 question?"

I mean when you start at the top of this, you really have to think about what personalized ads are. And we think they're better for people and businesses, and they're especially important to small businesses. They also can be delivered, can be done in a very privacy safe way. 
There are 2 big challenges coming from this iOS changes. The one is targeting and one is measurement. I'm taking the second one first. On measurement, we think we can address more than half of that underreporting by the end of the year and make more progress in the years ahead. We estimate we're underreporting iOS web conversions. We believe that real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher. And so we have to do the work to help clients measure these properly in order for them to really understand the outcomes they're getting and improving performance. And again, we think we can get a good chunk of that done this year and more in the next year. 
Targeting is a longer-term challenge. Our direct response products are built on user-level conversions. And as a result of the iOS changes, we don't see the same level of conversion data coming through. So we have to rebuild our targeting and optimization systems to work with less data. So this is a multiyear effort. We are developing privacy-enhancing technology to minimize the amount of personal information we learn and using more aggregate or anonymized data while still allowing us to show those relevant personalized ads and measure ads effectiveness. In order for this to really work and benefit all businesses, it can require some cross-industry collaboration and more commerce tools, and those are going to be longer-term efforts."

That would be for you. 
And then, Dave, maybe if I could follow up on OpEx and CapEx.

The primary driver is going to be accelerating head count growth in 2022. So that's going to be something you'll see head count coming in above 20%, obviously, that we had this quarter. And we also expect to have higher expenses from office operations and travel once larger parts of the workforce are returning to the office in 2022.

So for the next 1 and 3 years, especially, I think what you'll see is us putting more of the foundational pieces into place. This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in the near future. But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the mobile Internet, that it's going to enable social experiences that are the ultimate expression of what we try to build, which is allowing people to feel really present with the people they care about no matter where they actually are. And we think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical goods that would exist today and allow millions of people to be able to do work doing what they love and enabling a whole different economy around that, that I think is going to be another important pillar of our business. over the next decade. 
So on the next 1 to 3 years, I mean, I almost -- I wouldn't focus on the sort of business outcomes there quite as much as I would just -- there's a product to the infrastructure that we're putting in place. So there's -- they're a new platform and there's hardware components. There's the whole virtual reality product line. There's the augmented reality product line. We're kind of starting to put those pieces in place. There's the operating system and development model for all these new creative tools. There's the commerce parts of what we're doing around this and how they tie into broader commerce effort across Family of Apps. 
And then there's all the social platform work that we're doing with our Horizon effort that touches a bunch of different areas of what we're doing. But I think you'll see all of those pieces start to build out and start to mature a bit over the next few years. And then if we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade, this one we would sort of expect this to be more of a real business story. 
But I think what we kind of think about for the near term is that we're delivering the product experiences that are completely groundbreaking and that people try this, and they just think this is amazing and can see the glimpse of where this is going, and that will pave the way for the future. The business North Star that I mentioned in some of my opening remarks, we hope that by the end of the decade that we can help 1 billion people use the metaverse and support hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce. And I think if we can do that, then this will be a good investment over the long term."

We'll have a better sense of how these things work together as we get through the holiday season.

But I think as a format, it can be very fundamental. And I think we're still closer to the beginning of that journey than we are to its maturity in terms of just having rolled out some of the initial tests and experiences and rolled it out in Facebook.

I'm really excited about how that experience has come together. And I think, to your point, you mentioned it's important to have a VR social experience.

And whether we call it beta or not, I think the reality is we're going to be -- this is kind of similar to the question before about where we're going to be in a year or 3 years.

I can speak a bit to AI. So my answer is, yes, I think it's made a big impact. We issued these quarterly transparency reports, which I should add we're industry-leading on this in both in terms of defining this and in terms of the depth of what we outlined that people can hold us accountable and kind of see the breakdown of how we're actually doing. But what we measure in those reports and disclosed is what percent of the content that we act on is our AI or our internal systems finding rather than people having to report it because we have a lot of people, right, who use our products. If they find something that's problematic, and they report stuff to us. And it used to be before the last several years that most of what we did for community integrity was just respond to incoming reports, but we decided, hey, we should really try to get in front of this and build really sophisticated systems that we're not just relying on people to tell us when there are issues, but we can proactively go address that. 
And in most of these categories and we've basically gotten to the point now where 90-plus percent of the content were basically -- that we act on. We're identifying largely through the AI system, and it varies a bit by category. So for categories like nudity where relatively, it's easier train a computer to identify that. The numbers are very high. Some of the categories like hate speech that have been harder because, first of all, we're operating in I think it's around 150 languages around the world. I also think it's -- there's a lot of cultural nuance in this where you want to be able to make sure you understand these nuances and all those languages and that you want to make sure that people can say [ or did ] racism, right? If someone is saying something racist to encourage someone to do something hateful, that's bad. But if you -- if someone wants to basically say, hey, I saw this person doing this and people shouldn't be doing that, and you don't want to sense of people doing that. 
So it ends up being a very challenging problem. And for the first couple of years of working on this, we're still at a relatively low recall rate where our AI systems had 10%, 15% of the content that we were addressing -- we were dealing with proactively. But in recent years, like the AI progress has been very impressive. We're now above 90% of the content that we take an action on there is also proactive even with hate speech. 
So overall -- I mean, look, let me take this question in a slightly different direction, which is I know that there is a lot of scrutiny of our efforts. And I guess I just want to say to the team and the people who work on this that I'm really proud of the progress that they make. I think we have the best people in the world, and we're doing the best job of this, I believe, across any company in the industry. And I think this is an important area. There shouldn't be scrutiny on it, but I also think that any honest account of what's actually going on here should take into account that a huge amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made by a lot of talented people who are working on this."

So since we're now all focusing on the 2-year CAGRs for the guidance for the high end of the fourth quarter revenue actually has an acceleration on the 2-year CAGR. So I know we're talking about headwinds and IDFA and supply chains and everything like that, but the sequential growth looks normal, and then that 2-year CAGR is accelerating. 
So I guess where is the strength coming from? And would you call that a strong 4Q environment? And then, Sheryl, you talked about overhaul and targeting longer term to have less focus on users or user-based targeting and more contextual and kind of other things. I guess, high level, how do you think that will impact the overall return on ad spend compared to pre-IDFA levels? And as you look at Facebook's competitive position in the digital ad market versus some of the other large platforms, like any impact on the long term as you kind of retool the targeting?"

So I do think that kind of the seasonal sequential growth is lower than we've seen in the past. And with the range, I think that reflects that uncertainty."

We think we have opportunities to strengthen targeting ourselves, both by the work we do ourselves and as part of industry consortium. You're right in your question in that advertisers have to make a choice of where they advertise. So the question for us is, how good can our targeting be compared to others? 
I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple who have the direct data themselves, but I think our targeting still remains, I think, in very, very many ways, very good for advertisers. When you compare us on ROI, we've always performed well. We still do even though we've taken a hit, and we're focused on continuing to do that for businesses."

They're also obviously that intersects with the challenges with the targeting and measurement headwinds from iOS 14. So it's hard to parse exactly how the platform issues and the macroeconomic factors will play into Q4, but I think those are the 2 biggest factors driving the range of potential outcomes that we've outlined in our guidance. 
In terms of Reels and other IG services, I can take a crack at that, and then Mark and Sheryl want to add anything. Whenever we launch new experiences, this was true with Stories, it was true with Facebook Watch. It's -- you're always going to see some amount of shifting of people's time and attention to the new areas. And we do think that, that benefits the experience overall, and we think that makes the overall experience more engaging over time. And we do think that it's -- we're able to with Reels drive incremental engagement with Instagram and Facebook. So that's why we're investing to do that."
