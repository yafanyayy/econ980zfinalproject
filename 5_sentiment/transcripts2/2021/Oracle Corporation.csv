We are again reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500.

We are again reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. 
As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance, while EPS beat the midpoint of guidance by $0.05. 
Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Applications subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 27%, NetSuite ERP up 22%, and Fusion HCM up 21%. 
Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue which was up 123%. 
Autonomous Database was up 55%. Cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200%, but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. 
License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency. 
Operating expenses were down this quarter. And non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year and our best Q3 results in more than 10 years. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, slightly below our base tax rate as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars, up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $1.68 in USD, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. 
In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a onetime net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.7 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 23%. And free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the 2 growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. 
The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. 
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of $4 billion.
In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion. For the repurchase of Oracle shares. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers, including ISVs. And we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. 
As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx, to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY '22. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in FY '22 for the fifth year in a row. 
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It will look -- it may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impact could be different, so here it goes. 
Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support will grow faster than in Q3 as well as strategic back office cloud applications. 
As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between $1.28 and $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between $1.20 and $1.24 in constant currency. 
CapEx for Q4 on is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in the normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

3 months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars website in which he quotes SAP's CFO, Luka Mucic, making the following statement at an Investors conference. And I quote, ""I have checked, and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle."" In other words after personally checking, SAP's Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully. 
In Q3 alone, we signed contracts totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list here of over 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP or are currently in the process of doing so. I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into 2 distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. 
The first group is moving their entire company to the Fusion ERP suite, including core financials. It's Oracle wall to wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications, but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They've begun the migration, but they're not committed to doing the entire suite as yet, or they're not in the process of doing the entire suites yet. 
Okay, so let me go to start the list. TPX Company, an industrial manufacturer of railcars in North America, replaced out all of the SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement -- let's see, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything to the Fusion cloud; complete replacement of SAP ERP to Fusion ERP. G4S plc, a security services firm, and that's the world's largest security company by revenue; complete replacement of SAP R3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. 
First Solar North America is the only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States. Replaced SAP's S4 HANA, Ariba, Concur, third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion HCM and supply chain management. 
Transit Wireless, a North American telco, completely replaced out SAP R3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM. 
West Soffit County Council, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP and HCM, EPM is enterprise performance management. Complete wall to wall Oracle in West Soffit County Council. No more SAP. 
Cemex, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. 
Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer private label bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain and transportation management, et cetera. 
New Zealand and Inland Revenue, complete SAP R3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM.

[Postcon], let's say the second largest mail carrier in Germany. SAP complete replacement of ERP, replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management.

Africa World Airways, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. 
[The telco], that's the Bahrain telephone company. They have been running SAP for a decade, and they moved to Fusion Cloud ERP, EPM and SCM. 
The -- let's see, a European logistics and applied engineering group, actually the name, they don't want their name specifically mentioned. They're the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R3. And they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA in the cloud was much too high. And they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Tital Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America, had a -- had SAP replaced it with Oracle ERP, SCM and sales. 
Fedex had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They've replaced out all of the -- they're in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle, Fusion ERP and supply chain management. 
Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions then Oracle in other divisions. They're replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. 
Western Digital, complete replacement, they had SAP -- Western Digital had SAP at Sandisk. They had SAP at HGST. Replaced all of that out and have standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud -- Fusion ERP in the cloud. 
DP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR R3. They eliminated all of that. By the way, they're an EMEA marine terminal operator. They're located in EMEA. They're global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud. 
[Cohu], they are semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP, replaced out all of the SAP ERP and are standardized on Oracle. 
This one is interesting. They don't want their name mentioned. They're a huge European -- a North American and European manufacturer of ATMs. And they've replaced out all of SAP in the German subsidiary -- well actually throughout the world. And they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM, and they've added Oracle performance management, Fusion performance management.
Let's see, another company whose name doesn't want to be mentioned. Let's see, they're a high tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R3 ERP, HCM; and standardized on Oracle Fusion Fusion in the cloud. 
[ Art Gallery ] Group, they are a manufacturer of photo products in the U.K. They're replacing SAP with, guess what, Fusion ERP.

Enbridge. Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada. Replaced all of -- replaced out or all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Gemini Industries. Gemini Energy. They're an [lab]. They're an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil with substations all across Brazil. Replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. 
[Good Storage] in Latin America, a self-storage company in Brazil, again got rid of SAP, put Fusion ERP. 
Grupo Globo, they are a media entertainment, Latin America's largest media and entertainment company. Replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM, standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM. 
IQVIA had a complete SAP replacement. They are manufacturing for a pharmaceutical company in North America. They've moved away from SAP and standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. 
Corian, a health care company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe. Replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion. 
NatWest Group. NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They're replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. 
Windtree. Windtree is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy. Again, completely replacing out SAP with Oracle, Fusion ERP, SEM and EPM. 
Okay, now I'm going to go into the second group of companies. And these are companies that have started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet -- they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they're buying our supply chain. They're buying our procurement. They're buying our transportation management. They're buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials, so I want to be very specific. But they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products. 
GN Airlines, Apollo Tires, Akamai, an adhesive solutions company in the U.K. Arju's Commune, they're a municipality in central Denmark. 
Caesars Enterprise Services, to give you an idea, they bought procurement and supply chain, big hospitality company obviously in North America. 
[Danaher], a product -- they bought product life cycle management. They're a health care company. 
Department of Education and Training in Australia bought procurement. 
DHL was an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running SAP, but the new implementations that are going in are in other countries, not in Germany as yet. And other countries are Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Dow bought supply chain management and transportation management. 
FEMSA bought -- replaced all of SAP in some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse medicine, supply chain planning, ERP again. And in some subsidiaries, all of ERP including accounting, procurement, all of that. 
Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan, again the parent is running SAP Financials but [ decided ] all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Keurig Dr. Pepper, again bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of -- a financial services company in North America bought all of ERP. 
Honda bought -- still  runs SAP financials, but just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion on transportation management and is moving to -- from on-premise to the cloud. 
Indotech, a North American company again. Perot still running SAP financials, but the subs are running Oracle Fusion. 
Jackson Life, Latchme Cement. I'm not going to -- I'm going to read this faster now. Juniper Networks, Lloyd's Bank, move Incorporated, Munich Re. The largest food company in the world, but just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing, Olam International, PG&E, Portenos, Republic Services, SAC Wireless, and Nokia Company, Samsonite, Puma, Santander Bank [indiscernible] Therma Tru Doors. 
Okay. I'm going to stop right there. Or I'll take up all of the time, you won't be able to ask Larry questions. Okay. I don't want to do that. 
Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than the 100-plus companies. I did read over 100 companies, as I'm sure you painfully are aware of. The list is actually longer than the 100 companies that I've just read. 
Some of our most important wins at are very largest companies in regulated industries such as banking and utilities, who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don't want -- even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don't want to be on their name on this call because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they -- even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP. 
All right. So I'd like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. We specifically try to answer one key question. How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before, a major migration between ERP vendors.
Well, if you want to know the answer, read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don't take my word for it. Read the report. It's very short, and it's to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front. I mean , you can't find a magic project where there's more a bigger gap between #1 and #2. And so Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems. 
But what's surprising is SAP isn't #2. SAP isn't #3. SAP isn't listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the laggards. Gartner, if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors."" I'm going to read that again. ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors,"" quote unquote. 
SAP, the once dominant on-premise ERP market leader, is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that have happened? Because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It's that same 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. Too late for them to start now. I'll turn it back over to Safra."

Yes, I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is -- I think a long time ago, I said there are 2 technologies that will drive Oracle's future. One is Autonomous Database, and the other is ERP. 
We expect -- we are, again reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number. More than half of SAP's customers, we'll get. But keeping our own, plus getting a lot of it from the smaller companies like Import and Lawson."

One, the first half of the list that I read -- and they're about equal-sized lists, were people that are already moved from SAP Financials to Oracle Financials.
The second list were people that had partially moved to Oracle, but still we're running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out. If we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that, but they still run SAP financials, we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy. But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAP's on-premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that have started the journey will finish the journey and don't want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud and procurement in the cloud. 
So yes, we expect -- companies, we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement. They buy supply chain, and they say, ""Okay, I like that.

No one has anything like this where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a leak, a network leak that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on.
The second thing is autonomy is very interesting. The Oracle Autonomous Database -- By the way, Oracle  Autonomous Database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have autonomous Linux that is the foundation of the foundation operating system inside the OCI network. Oracle Autonomous Linux, Oracle Autonomous Database, has no human labor associated with it. 
Okay. So well, that's a huge cost savings. It is but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit if there's no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there is no human [mishap]. There's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that lead to the loss of data. 
So we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI other than its high performance, low cost, all of that -- everyone likes to pay less, and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end-user customers."

Now in addition, Java on premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications still require on-premise license for the customers use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals, but especially in telecommunications as many of the communications companies move to 5G. We are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in that -- in those areas.

So my question is this, why now and why from a product perspective?

We had these 3 separate on-premise ERP systems because -- and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that for the cloud. 
And SAP unbelievably they just -- I mean -- and by the way, we did a very good job. We started a decade ago. And we did, I think, a very good job, redoing it -- a big job to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud.
That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur. They bought ariba. They bought SuccessFactors. But they never -- and we made some acquisitions also, by the way, bought Taleo [ and other right now ] and other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. 
SAP instead embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database. 
And the thing we're competing with at so-called S4 HANA in the cloud, as what SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP. That is written in a programming language called ABAP. 
Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java. And it's entirely rewritten over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old, the same stuff that they've always had that they now will host for you. 
So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud. SAP just entirely missed the boat. So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. The -- again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened. 
And their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You're on the cloud, you get new features and functions. You're on this 90-day cadence, we give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. 
SAP's not like that. It's not a cloud system. It simply is, okay, you can get the SAP S/4HANA, and you can get it hosted by somebody. But they don't even have a cloud. They never built the cloud. That's what happened."

We are again reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance, while EPS beat the midpoint of guidance by $0.05.
Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Applications subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP, up 27%; NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 21%.
Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%. Autonomous Database was up 55%. Cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200% but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency.
Operating expenses were down this quarter, and non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year and our best Q3 result in more than 10 years. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, slightly below our base tax rate as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars, up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $1.68 in USD, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a onetime net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation.
Next, operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.7 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 23%. And free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the 2 growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments.
The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of $4 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.
As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY '22. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth, once again, in FY '22 for the fifth year in a row.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It will look -- it may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impact could be different, so here it goes.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support will grow faster than in Q3 as well as strategic back office cloud applications. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between $1.28 and $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between $1.20 and $1.24 in constant currency. CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in the normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars website in which he quotes SAP's CFO Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference, and I quote, ""I have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle."" In other words, after personally checking, SAP's Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully.
In Q3 alone, we signed contracts totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list of over 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP or are currently in the process of doing so.
I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into 2 distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the Fusion ERP suite, including core financials. That's Oracle wall to wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They've begun the migration, but they're not committed to doing the entire suite as yet or they're not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet. Okay. So let me go to start the list.
[ TPX Company ], an industrial manufacturer of railcars in North America, replaced out all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement -- let's see, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything, with the Fusion cloud, complete replacement of SAP ERP to Fusion ERP. G4S plc, a security services firm and that's the world's largest security company by revenue, complete replacement of SAP R/3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM.
First Solar, North America's only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States, replaced SAP's S/4HANA, Ariba, Concur, third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion HCM and supply chain management. Transit Wireless, a North American telco, completely replaced out SAP R/3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM.
West Sussex County Council, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP, [ ML ], HCM -- EPM is Oracle Enterprise Performance Management. Complete wall to wall Oracle at West Sussex County Council. No more SAP. CEMEX, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer private label bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain, transportation management, et cetera.
New Zealand Inland Revenue, complete SAP R/3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. University of the Andes in Latin America, the #1 university in Colombia, complete replacement of -- had SAP for 10 years, replaced it with Oracle ERP, HCM, EPM, supply chain, sales, everything. Bip&Drive, a travel and transportation company in EMEA, electronic toll payment provider for the roadways in Spain, again, replaced -- was offered a free S/4HANA upgrade, instead chose Oracle Fusion Cloud.
GE Grid Software, an industrial manufacturer, software for utilities and power transmissions, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP Fusion Cloud. Postcon, let's see, the second largest mail carrier in Germany, SAP complete replacement of [ RP ], replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management. Birmingham City Council, complete SAP replacement using Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM. They're the biggest city council in the U.K.
Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation, a toll road developer in Asia, SAP replacement -- got rid of SAP and replaced it with Oracle ERP and Oracle EPM. Africa World Airways (sic) [ Africa World Airlines ] replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. Batelco, that's the Bahrain Telecom Company, they have been running SAP for a decade, and they moved to Fusion Cloud ERP, EPM and SCM. The -- let's see, a European logistics and applied engineering group. Actually the name -- they don't want their name specifically mentioned. They're the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3, and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA in the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP.
[ Tical Logistica ], a logistics company in Latin America, had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP, SCM and sales. FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They've replaced out all of the -- they're in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions and Oracle in other divisions. They're replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management.
Western Digital, complete replacement. They had SAP -- Western Digital had SAP at SanDisk. They had SAP at HGST. Replaced all of that out and have standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud. DP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR R/3. They eliminated all of that. They're -- by the way, they're an EMEA marine terminal operator. They're located in EMEA. They're global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud. Cohu, they're a semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP, replaced out all of the SAP ERP and have standardized on Oracle.
This one is interesting. They don't want their name mentioned. They're a huge European -- North American and European manufacturer of ATMs. And they've replaced out all of SAP in the German subsidiary -- well, actually throughout the world. And they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM, and they've added Oracle performance management, Fusion performance management. Let's see. Another company whose name doesn't want to be mentioned. Let's see. They're a high tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R/3, ERP, HCM and standardized on Oracle Fusion in the cloud.
[ Artbelly Group ]. They are a manufacturer of photo products in the U.K. They're replacing SAP with, guess what, Fusion ERP. CONSOL Energy, utilities company in Pittsburgh, replaced out SAP with Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Enbridge. Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada, replaced out all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP.
Gemini Industries -- Gemini Energy. They're an [ LAB ]. They're an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil, with substations all across Brazil, replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. GoodStorage in Latin America, a self-storage company in Brazil, again, got rid of SAP, put in Fusion ERP. Grupo Globo. They're a media and entertainment -- Latin America's largest media and entertainment company, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM, standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM.
IQVIA, complete SAP replacement. They're a manufacturing pharmaceutical company in North America. They've moved away from SAP, standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. Corian, a health care company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe, replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion.
NatWest Group. NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They're replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Wind Tre. Wind Tre is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy. Again, completely replacing out SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP, SCM and EPM.
Okay. Now I'm going to go into the second group of companies, and these are companies that have started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet -- they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they're buying our supply chain. They're buying our procurement. They're buying our transportation management. They're buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials, so I want to be very specific. But they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products.
[ GN Airlines ]; Apollo Tyres; [ Akamai ], an adhesive solutions company in the U.K.; Aarhus Kommune, they're a municipality in Central Denmark. Caesars Enterprise Services. To give you an idea, they bought procurement and supply chain, big hospitality company obviously in North America.
Cepheid, a Danaher, a product life -- they bought product life cycle management. They're a health care company. Department of Education and Training in Australia bought procurement. DHL with an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running SAP. But the new implementations that are going in are -- in other countries, not in Germany as yet, in other countries are Oracle Fusion ERP.
Dow bought supply chain management and transportation management. FEMSA bought -- replaced all of SAP in some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse management, supply chain planning, ERP, again, and in some subsidiaries, all of ERP including accounting, procurement, all of that. Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan, again, the parent is running SAP financials, but subs all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Keurig Dr Pepper, again, bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of -- a financial services company in North America, bought all of ERP. Honda bought -- still runs SAP financials, but just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion transportation management and is moving to -- from on-premise to the cloud. [ Invetech ], again, a North American company, again, parent still running SAP financials, but the subs are running Oracle Fusion.
Jackson Life, [ Lakshmi Cement ]. I'm not -- I'm going to read these faster now. Juniper Networks, Lloyds Bank, Move, Inc., Munich Re. The largest food company in the world bought -- just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing; Olam International; PG&E; [ PORCELANOSA ]; Republic Services; SAC Wireless, a Nokia company; Samsonite; PUMA; Santander Bank; [indiscernible]; Therma-Tru Doors.
Okay. I'm going to stop right there or I'll take up all of the time. You won't be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don't want to do that.
Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than the 100-plus companies -- I did read over 100 companies, as I'm sure you're painfully aware of. The list is actually longer than the 100 companies I've just read. Some of our most important wins at our very largest companies in regulated industries, such as banking and utilities, who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don't want -- even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don't want to be on -- their name on this call because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they -- even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP.
All right. So I'd like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically, to try to answer one key question: How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before, a major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer, read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don't take my word for it. Read the report. It's very short, and it's to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front. I mean far like you can't find a Magic Quadrant where there's more -- a bigger gap between #1 and #2. And so Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems.
But what's surprising is SAP isn't #2. SAP isn't #3. SAP isn't listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the laggards. Gartner -- if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors."" I'm going to read that again. ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors."" SAP, the once dominant on-premise ERP market leader, is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that have happened? Because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It's that same 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud, and it's too late for them to start now.
I'll turn it back over to Safra."

Yes, I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is -- I think a long time ago I said there are 2 technologies that will drive Oracle's future. One is Autonomous Database, and the other is ERP. We expect -- we are -- again, reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number, more than half of SAP's customers, we'll get. But keeping our own, plus getting a lot from the smaller companies like Infor and Lawson."

One -- the first half of the list that I read, and they're about equal-sized lists, were people that already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list were people that had partially moved to Oracle but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out -- if we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that but they still run SAP financials, we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy.
But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAP's on-premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that have started the journey will finish the journey and don't want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud and procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect companies -- we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement. They buy supply chain, and they say, ""Okay. I like that. I'm now going to buy financials."" So yes, we expect all of this -- or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything."

One -- on the security front. One is we believe security should always be turned on. In other words, there is no light switch: security on, security off. We have these things called Max Security Zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off. Max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link -- a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on.
The second thing is autonomy is very interesting because the Oracle Autonomous Database -- by the way, Oracle Autonomous Database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have Autonomous Linux that is the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle Autonomous Linux, Oracle Autonomous Database, has no human labor associated with it. Okay. So [indiscernible] well, that's a huge cost savings. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit, if there's no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there is no human [ mishap ]. There's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data.
So we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI other than its high performance, low cost, all of -- everyone likes to pay less, and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers."

Now in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications, still require on-premise license for the customers' use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals. But especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in that -- in those areas.

We had these 3 separate on-premise ERP systems because -- and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that for the cloud. And SAP, unbelievably, they just -- I mean -- and by the way, we did a very good job. We started a decade ago. And we did, I think, a very good job redoing -- a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud.
That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur. They bought Ariba. They bought SuccessFactors. But they never -- and we made some acquisitions also, by the way. We bought Taleo and other -- right now and other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database. And the thing we're competing with, so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, that's what SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP -- this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java, and it's entirely rewritten over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old, the same stuff that they've always had that they now will host for you.
So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud. SAP just entirely missed the boat. So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. The -- again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened, and their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You're on the cloud. You get new features and functions. You're on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It simply is, okay, you can get the old -- you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened. It's amazing."

We are again reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500.

We are again reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance, while EPS beat the midpoint of guidance by $0.05.
Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Applications subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP, up 27%; NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 21%.
Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%. Autonomous Database was up 55%. Cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200% but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency.
Operating expenses were down this quarter, and non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year and our best Q3 result in more than 10 years. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, slightly below our base tax rate as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars, up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $1.68 in USD, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a onetime net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation.
Next, operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.7 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 23%. And free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the 2 growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments.
The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of $4 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.
As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY '22. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth, once again, in FY '22 for the fifth year in a row.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It will look -- it may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impact could be different, so here it goes.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support will grow faster than in Q3 as well as strategic back office cloud applications. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between $1.28 and $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between $1.20 and $1.24 in constant currency. CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in the normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars website in which he quotes SAP's CFO Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference, and I quote, ""I have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle."" In other words, after personally checking, SAP's Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully.
In Q3 alone, we signed contracts totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list of over 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP or are currently in the process of doing so.
I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into 2 distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the Fusion ERP suite, including core financials. That's Oracle wall to wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They've begun the migration, but they're not committed to doing the entire suite as yet or they're not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet. Okay. So let me go to start the list.
TTX Company, an industrial manufacturer of railcars in North America, replaced out all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement -- let's see, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything, with the Fusion cloud, complete replacement of SAP ERP to Fusion ERP. G4S plc, a security services firm and that's the world's largest security company by revenue, complete replacement of SAP R/3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM.
First Solar, North America's only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States, replaced SAP's S/4HANA, Ariba, Concur, third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion HCM and supply chain management. Transit Wireless, a North American telco, completely replaced out SAP R/3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM.
West Sussex County Council, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP, [ ML ], HCM -- EPM is Oracle Enterprise Performance Management. Complete wall to wall Oracle at West Sussex County Council. No more SAP. CEMEX, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer private label bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain, transportation management, et cetera.
New Zealand Inland Revenue, complete SAP R/3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. University of the Andes in Latin America, the #1 university in Colombia, complete replacement of -- had SAP for 10 years, replaced it with Oracle ERP, HCM, EPM, supply chain, sales, everything. Bip&Drive, a travel and transportation company in EMEA, electronic toll payment provider for the roadways in Spain, again, replaced -- was offered a free S/4HANA upgrade, instead chose Oracle Fusion Cloud.
GE Grid Software, an industrial manufacturer, software for utilities and power transmissions, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP Fusion Cloud. Postcon, let's see, the second largest mail carrier in Germany, SAP complete replacement of RP, replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management. Birmingham City Council, complete SAP replacement using Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM. They're the biggest city council in the U.K.
Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation, a toll road developer in Asia, SAP replacement -- got rid of SAP and replaced it with Oracle ERP and Oracle EPM. Africa World Airways (sic) [ Africa World Airlines ] replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. Batelco, that's the Bahrain Telecom Company, they have been running SAP for a decade, and they moved to Fusion Cloud ERP, EPM and SCM. The -- let's see, a European logistics and applied engineering group. Actually the name -- they don't want their name specifically mentioned. They're the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3, and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA in the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP.
Tical Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America, had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP, SCM and sales. FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They've replaced out all of the -- they're in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions and Oracle in other divisions. They're replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management.
Western Digital, complete replacement. They had SAP -- Western Digital had SAP at SanDisk. They had SAP at HGST. Replaced all of that out and have standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud. DP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR R/3. They eliminated all of that. They're -- by the way, they're an EMEA marine terminal operator. They're located in EMEA. They're global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized on Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud. Cohu, they're a semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP, replaced out all of the SAP ERP and have standardized on Oracle.
This one is interesting. They don't want their name mentioned. They're a huge European -- North American and European manufacturer of ATMs. And they've replaced out all of SAP in the German subsidiary -- well, actually throughout the world. And they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM, and they've added Oracle performance management, Fusion performance management. Let's see. Another company whose name doesn't want to be mentioned. Let's see. They're a high tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R/3, ERP, HCM and standardized on Oracle Fusion in the cloud.
albelli group, they are a manufacturer of photo products in the U.K. They're replacing SAP with, guess what, Fusion ERP. CONSOL Energy, utilities company in Pittsburgh, replaced out SAP with Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Enbridge. Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada, replaced out all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP.
Gemini Industries -- Gemini Energy. They're in LAD. They're an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil, with substations all across Brazil, replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. GoodStorage in Latin America, a self-storage company in Brazil, again, got rid of SAP, put in Fusion ERP. Grupo Globo. They're a media and entertainment -- Latin America's largest media and entertainment company, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM, standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM.
IQVIA, complete SAP replacement. They're a manufacturing pharmaceutical company in North America. They've moved away from SAP, standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. Corian, a health care company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe, replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion.
NatWest Group. NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They're replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Wind Tre. Wind Tre is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy. Again, completely replacing out SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP, SCM and EPM.
Okay. Now I'm going to go into the second group of companies, and these are companies that have started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet -- they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they're buying our supply chain. They're buying our procurement. They're buying our transportation management. They're buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials, so I want to be very specific. But they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products.
GN airlines; Apollo Tyres; Akamai, an adhesive solutions company in the U.K.; Aarhus Kommune, they're a municipality in Central Denmark. Caesars Enterprise Services. To give you an idea, they bought procurement and supply chain, big hospitality company obviously in North America.
Cepheid, a Danaher, a product life -- they bought product life cycle management. They're a health care company. Department of Education and Training in Australia bought procurement. DHL with an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running SAP. But the new implementations that are going in are -- in other countries, not in Germany as yet, in other countries are Oracle Fusion ERP.
Dow bought supply chain management and transportation management. FEMSA bought -- replaced all of SAP in some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse management, supply chain planning, ERP, again, and in some subsidiaries, all of ERP including accounting, procurement, all of that. Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan, again, the parent is running SAP financials, but subs all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. 
Keurig Dr Pepper, again, bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of -- a financial services company in North America, bought all of ERP. Honda bought -- still runs SAP financials, but just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion transportation management and is moving to -- from on-premise to the cloud. [ Invetech ], again, a North American company, again, parent still running SAP financials, but the subs are running Oracle Fusion.
Jackson Life, Lakshmi Cement. I'm not -- I'm going to read these faster now. Juniper Networks, Lloyds Bank, Move, Inc., Munich Re. The largest food company in the world bought -- just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing; Olam International; PG&E; [ PORCELANOSA ]; Republic Services; SAC Wireless, a Nokia company; Samsonite; PUMA; Santander Bank; [indiscernible]; Therma-Tru Doors.
Okay. I'm going to stop right there or I'll take up all of the time. You won't be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don't want to do that.
Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than the 100-plus companies -- I did read over 100 companies, as I'm sure you're painfully aware of. The list is actually longer than the 100 companies I've just read. Some of our most important wins at our very largest companies in regulated industries, such as banking and utilities, who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don't want -- even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don't want to be on -- their name on this call because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they -- even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP.
All right. So I'd like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically, to try to answer one key question: How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before, a major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer, read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don't take my word for it. Read the report. It's very short, and it's to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front. I mean far like you can't find a Magic Quadrant where there's more -- a bigger gap between #1 and #2. And so Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems.
But what's surprising is SAP isn't #2. SAP isn't #3. SAP isn't listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the laggards. Gartner -- if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors."" I'm going to read that again. ""SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors."" SAP, the once dominant on-premise ERP market leader, is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that have happened? Because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It's that same 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud, and it's too late for them to start now.
I'll turn it back over to Safra."

Yes, I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is -- I think a long time ago I said there are 2 technologies that will drive Oracle's future. One is Autonomous Database, and the other is ERP. We expect -- we are -- again, reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number, more than half of SAP's customers, we'll get. But keeping our own, plus getting a lot from the smaller companies like Infor and Lawson."

One -- the first half of the list that I read, and they're about equal-sized lists, were people that already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list were people that had partially moved to Oracle but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out -- if we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that but they still run SAP financials, we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy.
But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAP's on-premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that have started the journey will finish the journey and don't want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud and procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect companies -- we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement. They buy supply chain, and they say, ""Okay. I like that. I'm now going to buy financials."" So yes, we expect all of this -- or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything."

One -- on the security front. One is we believe security should always be turned on. In other words, there is no light switch: security on, security off. We have these things called Max Security Zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off. Max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link -- a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on.
The second thing is autonomy is very interesting because the Oracle Autonomous Database -- by the way, Oracle Autonomous Database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have Autonomous Linux that is the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle Autonomous Linux, Oracle Autonomous Database, has no human labor associated with it. Okay. So everybody says, well, that's a huge cost savings. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit, if there's no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there is no human mishap. There's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data.
So we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI other than its high performance, low cost, all of -- everyone likes to pay less, and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers."

Now in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications, still require on-premise license for the customers' use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals. But especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in that -- in those areas.

We had these 3 separate on-premise ERP systems because -- and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that for the cloud. And SAP, unbelievably, they just -- I mean -- and by the way, we did a very good job. We started a decade ago. And we did, I think, a very good job redoing -- a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud.
That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur. They bought Ariba. They bought SuccessFactors. But they never -- and we made some acquisitions also, by the way. We bought Taleo and other -- right now and other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database. And the thing we're competing with, so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, that's what SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP -- this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java, and it's entirely rewritten over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old, the same stuff that they've always had that they now will host for you.
So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud. SAP just entirely missed the boat. So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. The -- again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened, and their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You're on the cloud. You get new features and functions. You're on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It simply is, okay, you can get the old -- you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened. It's amazing."

We were successful by continuing to deliver best-in-class products and services, both infrastructure and applications to help our customers in their digital transformation, many who've reinvented themselves in real time because of the pandemic. 
Now the growth rates we are reporting today are entirely organic reflecting true related growth across our product portfolio. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.4 billion, up 8% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion and grew 32% in constant currency for the quarter, including Fusion ERP, which was up 42%. NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 30%. Our back office cloud application revenue is not only bigger than our nearest competitor, but also growing more than twice as fast. 
Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2.3 billion. OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103% in constant currency, autonomous database, up 56%; and cloud and customer revenues, up 50%. 
Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Customers are adopting OCI because of its unique focus on performance and security at the most competitive price. The highly differentiated Autonomous Database, which is available there and the flexibility of deploying Oracle Cloud, both in our own data center, what we call public cloud, or behind our customers' firewall, Cloud at Customer. 
License revenues were $2.1 billion, up 9% in USD, 5% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.2 billion, up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% in constant currency this quarter as we made significant investments in our cloud business. And while you can see some of the ROI in FY '21's revenue growth, we expect the most of the return will be realized in FY '22 and beyond. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $5.4 billion, up 6% in USD and the operating margin was 49%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% and below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items that hit in the quarter. EPS was $1.54, up 29% in USD, and up 22% in constant currency. By the way, GAAP EPS was $1.37, up 39% in USD, 31% in constant currency. 
Now for the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $28.7 billion, up 5% in USD, up 3% in constant currency. Total company revenues for the year were $40.5 billion, up 4%, USD; 2% in constant currency. FY '21 recurring cloud services and license support revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 71% of total company revenue, up from 70% last year and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow and accelerate. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $4.67, up 21% in USD, up 18% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
The full year operating margin percentage was 47%, actually, our best result in 7 years and up 245 basis points from 44% last year. Operating cash flows over the last 4 quarters was a record $15.9 billion, up 21% in USD. Our free cash flow was also a record, $13.8 billion, up 19% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.1 billion during the year. 
For the quarter -- back to the quarter, operating cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 34% in USD, and free cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 30% from last year. As an aside, free cash flow would have been about 30 -- $300 million lower as some CapEx targeted for Q4 was actually spent in the last 2 weeks, so in early June. We now have more than $46 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion, up 10% in USD, 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $41.3 billion, up 8% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. 
As you've heard me say many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, repaying of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 107 million shares for a total of $8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 329 million shares for a total of $21 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 44%. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. 
Now to the guidance. Let me first start with my confidence in the continuation of our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2022. As I've said many times over the last 2 years, our overall revenue growth is continuing to accelerate as our fast-growing cloud business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue for fiscal 2022 growing faster than fiscal '21 with constant currency revenue growth somewhere in mid-single digits. Given our increasing confidence in revenue growth and our unique and differentiated position in the market, we are going to invest back in the business at a greater rate so we can further accelerate the top line. 
We also see cloud as being fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as everyone knows, our annual non-GAAP margins of 47%, and that's what we run the business at, are, in fact, the highest non-GAAP margins of all of our competitors and we believe that now is the right time to increase our investment to capture market share. As such, we expect to roughly double our cloud CapEx spend in FY 2022 to nearly $4 billion. We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justify this increased investment and our margins will expand over time. 
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1. I'll review this on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should be about 2% to 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on EPS in Q1. However, currency fluctuates and the actual impact could be different. 
Total revenues for Q1 are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in USD and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue growth for Q1 will be about the same as Q4 at 4% in constant currency and then climb through the year. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 2% and 6% and be between $0.94 and $0.98 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency is expected to be anywhere from negative to positive 2 and be between $0.91 and $0.95 in constant currency. Now my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect to normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate.will average around 19-or-so. 
Finally, we want to thank our employees around the world for working so hard and staying focused on our customers and partners during the pandemic. And we also want to spend -- send particular thanks and warmest wishes to our employees in COVID hotspots who've been hit particularly hard in months and with whom we have been working very hard to support them, including providing vaccination. We just want to thank all of you and congratulate you all on a successful year and year-end, you've all been remarkable. So thank you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings",641,"Thanks, Safra, and great job. Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings per share growth. Our strategy is as easy to explain as it is technically challenging to implement. That's a good thing, but it wasn't hard to do. Others would be able to do it. 
Our strategy and applications depends on Oracle becoming the world's largest provider of cloud ERP systems. Then building upon that strong ERP foundation, We're going to expand into manufacturing, CRM and an industry-specific applications. We are successfully executing this strategy. Oracle Fusion and NetSuite are now the world's 2 most popular cloud ERP systems. SAP, the leader in on-premise ERP, never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. This has caused hundreds of customers to abandon SAP and migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP. That's already happened. But over the coming months, several more major banks and utilities and a lot of other companies will complete their Oracle Fusion implementation projects and go live on Fusion ERP. Oracle is taking massive amounts of share away from SAP ERP. It's crucial to our future. 
While our Fusion and NetSuite have long been growing, we have also developed a complete new generation of cloud application suites. Our new manufacturing systems fully support and manage automated robotic factories. No one else does that. Our new cloud CRM applications help you sell more by fully automated Internet advertising, lead generation and qualification. Nobody else does that. And we're launching cloud application suites for 2 new industries, health care and state and local government. Our health care initiative is an outgrowth of the national public health management systems that we built to manage the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and vaccine distribution in the United States and in other countries around the world. 
In summary, our cloud application portfolio is more complete than other apps vendors and better integrated because almost all of our applications were developed internally, not acquired. Our infrastructure strategy depends on AI technology, specifically, neural networks and machine learning that we use to develop second-generation autonomous cloud services, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Autonomous Linux operating system and an array of autonomous cybersecurity defense bots that automatically identify and neutralize cyber attacks. All of Oracle's cloud applications then run within the defensive perimeter of Oracle's autonomous cloud infrastructure, the most reliable and secure platform in the world. And that's increasingly important in a world plagued by cyber warfare, data theft and ransomware. 
Oracle's autonomous database and other autonomous services eliminate human labor. No human labor means no human error or opportunity for human mischief. Autonomy makes computer systems and cars much safer and more reliable. The Oracle Autonomous Database offers 99.995% availability. That means only a few minutes of downtime a year. And we have 0 downtime security patching and upgrades, available today for infrastructure and very soon available for all of our applications. 
Economics is also important. OCI has, by far, the best cost performance of any infrastructure hyperscaler. That's why so many service providers like Zoom have chosen to expand into OCI. OCI's cost performance is continuously getting better. Our new version of MySQL, the world's most popular open-source database, just got between 10 and 100x faster. And when you charge by the minute, every minute you don't use is money saved. 
Our new ARM microprocessors from technology partner Ampere delivers much better compute cost performance than either Intel or AMD and by far, the lowest energy usage of any server microprocessor in the world. So our latest infrastructure technologies are Good for our applications, good for your budget, good for the health of the planet and very good for Oracle's future. 
Back to you, Safra."

We're also upgrading our installed base of the VE Business Suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customers, customers, in for customers, people like that, they're coming from our on-premise installed base. So that's really the trend. And we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomena is relatively recent in the last 12 months, over the last 2 years, but it's really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So we think that's going to hold. 
So another way to look at it is it's a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses. Fusion ERP, I mean, certainly much bigger than $10 billion -- and that means bigger than $10 billion, probably bigger than $20 billion as these businesses mature."

I wanted to dig in a little bit on the infrastructure side of the equation. In particular, OCI. Another quarter of, I think you said, 103% growth in OCI consumption. Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle database workloads? You know there's a lot of those out there that just run so well with OCI? Or is there a broader perspective of the big workloads that guys are bringing over, not looking for commentary on any specific customer, but just broadly, what do you see in this space?

About half of it's database happened, but is everything else.

The other thing varies from things like Zoom who have moved over, but also in simulations, and we're very, very good at running simulation software. So almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their past simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. 
So we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads running on -- running in OCI and the other half is a variety of new customers doing new applications, not database related."

Let me get it started, and then Larry can finish. So Derrick, I'm glad you asked because when customers move from running their own dozen or 100 Exadatas, when it's time for a refresh or a new set, we prefer that they go to cloud a customer and -- or have a dedicated region. However, just so that you know since you all focus on the numbers, you have to understand that when we sell hardware, regular way, we recognize all that revenue once it's delivered, all that hardware is delivered. 
But when we install cloud a customer, Exadata cloud a customer or dedicated region, We don't recognize that revenue upfront. And so -- and you don't even see that, that is all happening right now in our income statement and yet we're still growing. So as a general matter, first of all, it is much -- even though we believe we make around 3x, maybe more in revenue in the case of Cloud at Customer versus selling -- just selling the hardware can be anywhere from 3 to 5x. The customer actually ends up spending less because we manage their entire estate. We update their databases, et cetera, depending on what services they're using, and they get the benefit of always having capacity, always having the most up-to-date system, the most secure system and patched and fully managed by us. So though, ultimately, they give us significantly more money 3 to 5x as much. In fact, they end up spending much less maintain that estate. So for -- it's kind of a win-win because we're much more efficient, fully automated and saves them the immense amount of labor it takes to run these very critical production systems.

And with Fusion ERP, we are now filing our quarterly and annual financial statements faster than any other company in the S&P 500. This is possible because of the highly automated and machine learning-enabled system that helps us complete the accounting of financial transactions much more quickly. 
As you can see, we had a fantastic quarter, with revenue nearly $200 million above my guidance. Q4 is really a story of every product, every region and every metric exceeding expectation. The credit for the excellent full year results in the quarter goes to our global team of employees who supported our customers without interruption this past year. We were successful by continuing to deliver best-in-class products and services, both infrastructure and applications, to help our customers in their digital transformation, many who've reinvented themselves in real time because of the pandemic. 
Now the growth rates we are reporting today are entirely organic, reflecting true 
[Audio Gap]
related growth across our product portfolio. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.4 billion, up 8% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion and grew 32% in constant currency for the quarter, including Fusion ERP, which was up 42%. NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 30%. Our back office cloud application revenue is not only bigger than our nearest competitor, but also growing more than twice as fast. 
Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2.3 billion. OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103% in constant currency, autonomous database, up 56%; and cloud and customer revenue, up 50%. 
Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Customers are adopting OCI because of its unique focus on performance and security at the most competitive price. The highly differentiated Autonomous Database, which is available there and the flexibility of deploying Oracle Cloud, both in our own data center, what we call public cloud, or behind our customers' firewall, Cloud at Customer. 
License revenues were $2.1 billion, up 9% in USD, 5% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.2 billion, up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% in constant currency this quarter as we made significant investments in our cloud business. And while you can see some of the ROI in FY '21's revenue growth, we expect the most of the return will be realized in FY '22 and beyond. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $5.4 billion, up 6% in USD and the operating margin was 49%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% and below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items that hit in the quarter. EPS was $1.54, up 29% in USD, and up 22% in constant currency. By the way, GAAP EPS was $1.37, up 39% in USD, 31% in constant currency. 
Now for the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $28.7 billion, up 5% in USD, up 3% in constant currency. Total company revenues for the year were $40.5 billion, up 4%, USD; 2% in constant currency. FY '21 recurring cloud services and license support revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 71% of total company revenue, up from 70% last year and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow and accelerate. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $4.67, up 21% in USD, up 18% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
The full year operating margin percentage was 47%, actually, our best result in 7 years and up 245 basis points from 44% last year. Operating cash flows over the last 4 quarters was a record $15.9 billion, up 21% in USD. Our free cash flow was also a record $13.8 billion, up 19% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.1 billion during the year. 
For the quarter -- back to the quarter, operating cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 34% in USD, and free cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 30% from last year. As an aside, free cash flow would have been about 30 -- $300 million lower as some CapEx targeted for Q4 was actually spent in the last 2 weeks, so in early June. We now have more than $46 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion, up 10% in USD, 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $41.3 billion, up 8% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. 
As you've heard me say many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, repaying of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 107 million shares for a total of 8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 329 million shares for a total of 21 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 44%. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. 
Now to the guidance. Let me first start with my confidence in the continuation of our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2022. As I've said many times over the last 2 years, our overall revenue growth is continuing to accelerate as our fast-growing cloud business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue for fiscal 2022 growing faster than fiscal '21, with constant currency revenue growth somewhere in mid-single digits. Given our increasing confidence in revenue growth and our unique and differentiated position in the market, we are going to invest back in the business at a greater rate so we can further accelerate the top line. 
We also see cloud as being fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as everyone knows, our annual non-GAAP margins of 47%, and that's what we run the business at, are in fact the highest non-GAAP margins of all of our competitors and we believe that now is the right time to increase our investment to capture market share. As such, we expect to roughly double our cloud CapEx spend in FY 2022 to nearly $4 billion. We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time. 
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1. I'll review this on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should be about 2% to 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on EPS in Q1. However, currency fluctuates and the actual impact could be different. 
Total revenues for Q1 are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in USD and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue growth for Q1 will be about the same as Q4 at 4% in constant currency and then climb through the year. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 2% and 6% and be between $0.94 and $0.98 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency is expected to be anywhere from negative to positive 2% and be between $0.91 and $0.95 in constant currency. Now my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect to normalize for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 19-or-so. 
Finally, we want to thank our employees around the world for working so hard and staying focused on our customers and partners during this pandemic. And we also want to spend -- send particular thanks and warmest wishes to our employees in COVID hotspots who've been hit particularly hard in months and with whom we have been working very hard to support them, including providing vaccination. We just want to thank all of you and congratulate you all on a successful year and year-end, you've all been remarkable. So thank you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings",642,"Thanks, Safra, and great job. Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings per share growth. Our strategy is as easy to explain as it is technically challenging to implement. That's a good thing, but if it wasn't hard to do, others would be able to do it. 
Our strategy and applications depends on Oracle becoming the world's largest provider of cloud ERP systems. Then building upon that strong ERP foundation, we're going to expand into manufacturing, CRM and industry-specific applications. We are successfully executing this strategy. Oracle Fusion and NetSuite are now the world's 2 most popular cloud ERP systems. SAP, the leader in on-premise ERP, never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. This has caused hundreds of customers to abandon SAP and migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP. That's already happened. But over the coming months, several more major banks and utilities and a lot of other companies will complete their Oracle Fusion implementation projects and go live on Fusion ERP. Oracle is taking massive amounts of share away from SAP ERP. It's crucial to our future. 
While our Fusion and NetSuite businesses have long been growing, we have also developed a complete new generation of cloud application suites. Our new manufacturing systems fully support and manage automated robotic factories. No one else does that. Our new cloud CRM applications help you sell more by fully automated Internet advertising, lead generation and qualification. Nobody else does that. And we're launching cloud application suites for 2 new industries, health care and state and local government. Our health care initiative is an outgrowth of the national public health management systems that we built to manage the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and vaccine distribution in the United States and in other countries around the world. 
In summary, our cloud application portfolio is more complete than other apps vendors and better integrated because almost all of our applications were developed internally, not acquired. Our infrastructure strategy depends on AI technology, specifically, neural networks and machine learning, that we use to develop second-generation autonomous cloud services, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Autonomous Linux operating system and an array of autonomous cybersecurity defense bots that automatically identify and neutralize cyber attacks. All of Oracle's cloud applications then run within the defensive perimeter of Oracle's autonomous cloud infrastructure, the most reliable and secure platform in the world. And that's increasingly important in a world plagued by cyber warfare, data theft and ransomware. 
Oracle's autonomous database and other autonomous services eliminate human labor. No human labor means no human error or opportunity for human mischief. Autonomy makes computer systems and cars much safer and more reliable. The Oracle Autonomous Database offers 99.995% availability. That means only a few minutes of downtime a year. And we have 0 downtime security patching and upgrades, available today for infrastructure and very soon available for all of our applications. 
Economics is also important. OCI has, by far, the best cost performance of any infrastructure hyperscaler. That's why so many service providers like Zoom have chosen to expand into OCI. OCI's cost performance is continuously getting better. Our new version of MySQL, the world's most popular open-source database, just got between 10 and 100x faster. And when you charge by the minute, every minute you don't use is money saved. 
Our new ARM microprocessors from technology partner Ampere delivers much better compute cost performance than either Intel or AMD and by far, the lowest energy usage of any server microprocessor in the world. So our latest infrastructure technologies are good for our applications, good for your budget, good for the health of the planet and very good for Oracle's future. 
Back to you, Safra."

We're also upgrading our installed base of the E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customers, in for customers, people like that, they're coming from our on-premise installed base. So that's really the trend. And we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomena is relatively recent in the last 12 months, over the last 2 years, but it's really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So we think that's going to hold. 
So another way to look at it is, it's a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses. Fusion ERP, I mean, certainly much bigger than $10 billion -- and NetSuite's bigger than $10 billion

Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle database workloads? We know there's a lot of those out there that just run so well on OCI.

The other thing varies from things like Zoom, who have moved over, but also in simulations, and we're very, very good at running simulation software. So almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their fast simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. 
So we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now, where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads running on -- running in OCI and the other half is a variety of new customers doing new applications, not database related."

So as a general matter, first of all, it is much -- even though we believe we make around 3x, maybe more in revenue, in the case of Cloud at Customer, versus selling -- just selling the hardware, it can be anywhere from 3 to 5x, the customer actually ends up spending less because we manage their entire estate. We update their databases, et cetera, depending on what services they're using, and they get the benefit of always having capacity, always having the most up-to-date system, the most secure system and patched and fully managed by us. So though, ultimately, they give us significantly more money, 3 to 5x as much, in fact, they end up spending much less to maintain that estate. So for -- it's kind of a win-win because we're much more efficient, fully automated and saves them the immense amount of labor it takes to run these very critical production systems. 
Okay. I guess Larry's question, what was it again, Derrick?"

We had a great quarter as total revenue was [ $100 million above ] the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08",954,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was [ $100 million above ] the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance. As the dollar strengthened from when I gave guidance, and it strengthened significantly, we didn't get the benefit we would have gotten had it stayed at the same level throughout the quarter.
Now from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and accounted for 76% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues are now at an annualized revenue of $10 billion with an accelerating growth rate that we expect will exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 7%, with Fusion apps up 26% in USD and 24% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office applications grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 30%, and NetSuite ERP up 26%.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 3%. And excluding the legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew in the mid-30s, and we saw triple-digit bookings growth this quarter. So I expect the infrastructure revenue growth will ramp higher through the [indiscernible]
OCI consumption revenue, which includes autonomous database, was up 80% in constant currency and cloud and customer revenue was up 44%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services were up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and that's up from 4% last quarter.
License revenues were $813 million, down 8% after a tough [ comparison ] from last year's Q1. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.7 billion, up 4% in USD, up 2% in constant currency.
Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. [ Gross ] margin for cloud services and license support was 84%. And the gross profit dollars grew 2%. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 2% from last year, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, slightly below our base tax rate of 19%, and earnings per share was USD 1.03, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency.
As a result of some discrete items, the GAAP tax rate was 8.4%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.86, which was up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency. Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $15.3 billion, up 17% in USD and our free cash flow over the same period was $12.6 billion, up 9% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, also over the same period. CapEx for Q1 alone was $1.1 billion.
We now have more than $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10 billion, up 1% from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments, but with gross deferred revenue up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, our balance is $38.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
As we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value [ for ] shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, premium use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares for a total of $8 billion. And over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 46%, at an average price that's about half the current share price.
In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share.
Now to guidance, what you're all waiting for. I remain highly confident that fiscal year '22 revenue growth will accelerate because our fast-growing cloud businesses are becoming a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue growth for fiscal year 2022, which is the one we're in, somewhere in the mid-single digits in constant currency and accelerating.
Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect company operating margins will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels.
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, and I'll review this on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a very minor positive effect on total revenue and EPS in Q2. Total revenue for Q2 are expected to grow between 3% to 5% in both USD and constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q2 are expected to grow more than [ 40% ] in both USD and constant currency and then climb higher through the second half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in both USD and constant currency, and be between $1.09 and $1.13.
My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, one-time tax  events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, both up and down, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our non-GAAP tax rate will average around 19% or so.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle Cloud business infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year. Oracle and NetSuite were pioneers in cloud applications. Oracle and NetSuite being the very first cloud company of any kind. Several years later, Amazon launched the very first cloud infrastructure company.
Oracle Fusion ERP has over 8,000 cloud customers. NetSuite ERP has over 28,000 cloud application customers. Oracle is the overwhelming market leader in the global cloud ERP market. Oracle Cloud ERP is currently used by many of the largest most complex companies on Earth. This past quarter in Q1, a company I couldn't name until now, a major portion of Bank of America went live on Oracle Fusion ERP, consolidating ledgers in 33 separate countries into 1 global cloud ledger.
Also in Q1, another huge bank, Macquarie, the largest investment bank in Australia, went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Also in Q1, Vanguard, the largest global mutual fund provider, went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Not just in Q1. Okay. 
So Oracle Fusion is building a very strong position in the world's largest financial services companies: HSBC, Bank New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, they are all live on Oracle's Fusion applications.
We have started working with our strategic partners in banking to develop a new generation of cloud B2B financing and payment systems. There are things you can do in the cloud you could never do on-premise. There are opportunities in the cloud if you are the largest ERP supplier. There are opportunities to go into new businesses like financing and banking, with banking partners that would have been impossible with the old on-premise systems. And those are opportunities we are aggressively pursuing with the world's money-center banks. Banking and health care will be Oracle's 2 largest verticals.
In the infrastructure part of our cloud business, we continue to innovate in several technical areas. We have made great progress. And then now -- and we are now on our way into the big 4 global hyperscalers, and I'll give a list of those in case you don't know. They are Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and then Google. Note the order. I was not the one who sorted that list. Oracle has come a long way in the cloud infrastructure business. Our technology is getting really good and very competitive.
And of course, we continue to deliver breakthrough innovations in areas where we have long been strongest, -- remains unrivaled in running the world's biggest and most critical systems. And our other database, the open source system, MySQL, is now on a new generation. And it now includes an ultra high-performance in-memory query processor called HeatWave, plus a new set of management tools called the Autopilot. Amazon's version of MySQL -- again, MySQL is an open source database, anyone can have it. Amazon took a version of MySQL renamed it Aurora, and put it up in AWS. Now the open source version of MySQL -- the old version of MySQL pre-HeatWave is very, very slow in processing [indiscernible] In fact, the way you use Aurora, typically in Amazon over the years is you do your transaction processing in Aurora, also known as MySQL. And then when you do your query processing, you move your data out of Amazon's MySQL, old Aurora and put into a thing called Redshift, a data warehouse system from Amazon. Recently, Snowflake has come up with a data warehouse that runs at AWS, and Snowflake competing quite effectively against Redshift because Snowflake runs on multiple clouds. And Snowflake, like Redshift, is way faster at queries than the old MySQL or Aurora.
Okay. So Oracle introduces this new version of MySQL. This new generation of MySQL, that's the HeatWave. And the customer reaction has been stupendous. Simply for the reason that over and over again, they measure Oracle's MySQL to be 100x faster than Amazon's Aurora for query processing.
Now this was actually not unexpected. The old MySQL, which is Aurora. That's what Aurora is, the old mystical, it's terrible for query processing. What was unexpected is that Oracle MySQL proved to be more than 10x faster than Amazon's Redshift or Snowflake for query processing. There's one database. So you can do transaction on open source database you can do a transaction. And that same database, MySQL with HeatWave is the fastest place to run your queries. So you don't need to move your data into Redshift or Snowflake  anymore just to do queries.
This has excited so many customers that they asked us over and over again. We made it available this quarter. Oracle's MySQL HeatWave is available at the Oracle public cloud, but they asked that we would make it available on other public clouds. And we thought that's what our customers want. That's what we're going to do. So we plan to [indiscernible] MySQL with HeatWave available on other public clouds in addition to the Oracle Public Cloud and compete aggressively where we have huge technical advantages over Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift and perhaps most interestingly, huge technical advantages, performance and cost over Snowflake. I'll turn it back to Safra."

And the work from home and all the data that capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you had implemented your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud.
And also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID. And there's no question that digital transformation is the top goal been delaying or moving slowly, have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked -- and I think it's our third year in a row in the top right-hand on quadrant of Gartner, really with no one even close to us, we are the #1 choice of for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office application.
So for us, I have to say that there's just incredible, incredible momentum and commitment from our -- from prospects and customers. And for companies who have been on-premise, either with our products or historically with SAP, where they just can't continue like they did."

And basically, all of the implementation services you see for applications or cloud implementations, we've now made the migration and that should just grow steadily. We really don't have a lot of competition, that's the understatement of the year, in cloud ERP. And I'd love to know who the competitors are.
SAP has -- it doesn't have a product. When we bid -- we're in a competition with SAP right now. And we've just gotten -- we just found out we got -- we got -- we're a vendor of choice. And their big thing was, well, SAP doesn't have a cloud product. They have hosting. They're willing to put a custom computer in Amazon and just build a specialized version for the customer. That's not the cloud.
We update our application every 3 months, the entire fleet of 8,000 Fusion customers are updated every 3 months. The entire fleet of 28,000 NetSuite customers are updated every 6 months. You get SAP, they install it. And then they probably will update it again 5 years from now. It's an on-premise system. They don't have a cloud system. We're winning every deal against them, everyone.

It's interesting question because Amazon doesn't really have it. And well, Amazon has like 13 separate databases where the Oracle data, we do everything in a single database. We don't think an application should talk to 5 or 6 separate databases. We think it's a very risky security architecture. But the question is, Amazon is the big leader in cloud. We're the big leader in databases. Will -- if forced to choose, will they pick the Amazon Cloud and a database other than the Oracle Database. And -- or are they willing to move to migrate their Oracle applications to the Oracle Cloud to get all the security and performance advantages of the Oracle database. That's been the big question out there.
And is our cloud good enough to compete with Amazon and Google and Microsoft. And I think we have answered those questions. It's not only good enough to compete. But in many cases, it's much better for security, for performance, for reliability. And that -- one of the reasons we have such a big ISB business, [indiscernible] left Amazon, and come to the Oracle Cloud was because we cost less. So we have significant cost advantages. And it's a big step to proving that the Oracle Cloud is part of the big 4. It's not a big 3. It's a big 4. I'm not including -- they're regional -- not global on I'm counting the [ Garnter ] [indiscernible] it's Amazon -- Google.

And we're seeing people moving more and more things to the Oracle Cloud now and this Gartner report will just help -- we'll move that along quite nicely.
By the way, it's not just the Gartner report. If they come and look and they run [indiscernible] if they do a comparison, a straight comparison us, Google, Amazon.

22247,1680214196,2395957,"Oracle Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 13, 2021",2021-09-13,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was $100 million, above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 abo",946,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was $100 million, above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance. As the dollar strengthened from when I gave guidance, and it strengthened significantly, we didn't get the benefit we would have gotten had it stayed at the same level throughout the quarter.
Now from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and accounted for 76% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues are now at an annualized revenue of $10 billion with an accelerating growth rate that we expect will exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 7%, with Fusion apps up 26% in USD and 24% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office applications grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 30%, and NetSuite ERP up 26%.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 3%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew in the mid-30s, and we saw triple-digit booking growth this quarter. So I expect the infrastructure revenue growth will ramp higher through the fiscal year.
OCI consumption revenue, which includes autonomous database, was up 80% in constant currency, and cloud customer revenue was up 44%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services were up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency, and that's up from 4% last quarter.
License revenues were $813 million, down 8% after a tough compare from last year's Q1. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.7 billion, up 4% in USD, up 2% in constant currency.
Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 2%. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 2% from last year, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, slightly below our base tax rate of 19%, and earnings per share was USD 1.03, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency.
As a result of some discrete items, the GAAP tax rate was 8.4%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.86, which was up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency. Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $15.3 billion, up 17% in USD, and our free cash flow over the same period was $12.6 billion, up 9% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, also over the same period. CapEx for Q1 alone was $1.1 billion.
We now have more than $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10 billion, up 1% from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments but with gross deferred revenue up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, our balance is $38.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
As we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares for a total of $8 billion. And over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 46% and an average price that's about half the current share price.
In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share.
Now to guidance, what you're all waiting for. I remain highly confident that fiscal year '22 revenue growth will accelerate because our fast growing cloud businesses are becoming a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue growth for fiscal year 2022, which is the one we're in, somewhere in the mid-single digits in constant currency and accelerating. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise; and as we look ahead to next year, we expect company operating margins will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels.
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, and I'll review this on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a very minor positive effect on total revenue and EPS in Q2. Total revenue for Q2 are expected to grow between 3% to 5% in both USD and constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q2 are expected to grow more than 5% in both USD and constant currency and then climb higher through the second half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in both USD and constant currency and be between $1.09 and $1.13. 
My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, both up and down, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our non-GAAP tax rate will average around 19% or so.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle Cloud business infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year.

Oracle Cloud business infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year. Oracle and NetSuite were pioneers in cloud applications, Oracle and NetSuite being the very first cloud company of any kind. Several years later, Amazon launched the very first cloud infrastructure company.
Oracle Fusion ERP has over 8,000 cloud customers. NetSuite ERP has over 28,000 cloud application customers. Oracle is the overwhelming market leader in the global cloud ERP market. Oracle Cloud ERP is currently used by many of the largest most complex companies on Earth. This past quarter in Q1, a company I couldn't name until now, a major portion of Bank of America went live on Oracle Fusion ERP, consolidating ledgers in 33 separate countries into 1 global cloud ledger.
Also in Q1, another huge bank, Macquarie, the largest investment bank in Australia, went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Also in Q1, Vanguard, the largest global mutual fund provider, went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. That's just in Q1. Okay.
So Oracle Fusion is building a very strong position in the world's largest financial services companies: HSBC, Bank New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase. They are all live on Oracle's Fusion applications. We have started working with our strategic partners in banking to develop a new generation of cloud B2B financing and payment systems. There are things you can do on the cloud you could never do on-premise. There are opportunities in the cloud if you are the largest ERP supplier. There are opportunities to go into new businesses like financing and banking, with banking partners that would have been impossible with the old on-premise systems. And those are opportunities we are aggressively pursuing with the world's money-center banks. Banking and health care will be Oracle's 2 largest verticals going forward. Speaking of health care, Humana was an important fusion ERP win in Q1.
In the infrastructure part of our cloud business, we continue to innovate in several technical areas. We have made great progress. And then now -- and we are now on our way into the big 4 global hyperscalers, and I'll give a list of those in case you don't know. They are Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Google. Note the order. I was not the one who sorted that list. Oracle has come a long way in the cloud infrastructure business. Our technology is getting really good and very competitive.
And of course, we continue to deliver breakthrough innovations in areas where we have long been strongest like databases. The Oracle Database remains unrivaled in running the world's biggest and most critical systems. And our other database, the open source system MySQL, is now on a new generation. And it now includes an ultra high-performance in-memory query processor called HeatWave, plus a new set of management tools called the Autopilot.
Amazon's version of MySQL -- again, MySQL is an open source database. Anyone can have it. Amazon took a version of MySQL, renamed it Aurora and put it up in AWS. Now the open source version of MySQL -- the old version of MySQL pre-HeatWave is very, very slow at query processing. In fact, the way you use Aurora, typically in Amazon over the years, is you do your transaction processing in Aurora, also known as MySQL. And then when you did your query processing, you moved your data out of Amazon's MySQL, old Aurora, and put into a thing called Redshift, a data warehouse system from Amazon. Recently, Snowflake has come up with a data warehouse that runs at AWS, and Snowflake competing quite effectively against Redshift because Snowflake runs on multiple clouds. And Snowflake, like Redshift, is way faster at queries than the old MySQL or Aurora.
Okay. So Oracle introduces this new version of MySQL, this new generation of MySQL. That's the HeatWave. And the customer reaction has been stupendous simply for the reason that, over and over again, they measure Oracle's MySQL to be 100x faster than Amazon's Aurora for query processing. Now this was actually not unexpected. The old MySQL, which is Aurora -- that's what Aurora is, the old MySQL, it's terrible for query processing. What was unexpected is that Oracle MySQL proved to be more than 10x faster than Amazon's Redshift or Snowflake for query processing. So suddenly, there's one database that you can do transaction -- one open source database you can do transaction processing on, MySQL with HeatWave. And that same database, MySQL with HeatWave, is the fastest place to run your queries. So you don't need to move your data into Redshift or Snowflake anymore just to do queries.
This has excited so many customers that they asked us over and over again. We made it available -- have we made it available this quarter. Oracle's MySQL with HeatWave, if it's available at the Oracle Public Cloud, but they asked if we would make it available on other public clouds. And we thought that's what our customers want. That's what we're going to do. So we plan to make Oracle MySQL with HeatWave available on other public clouds in addition to the Oracle Public Cloud and compete aggressively where we have huge technical advantages over Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift and perhaps most interestingly, huge technical advantages, performance and cost over Snowflake.
I'll turn it back to Safra."

I think that one of the things that has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data that -- capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud.
And also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID. And there's no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it.
And of course, because we are ranked, and I think it's our third year in a row, in the top right-hand quadrant of Gartner, really with no one even close to us, we are the #1 choice of -- for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there's just incredible, incredible momentum and commitment from our -- from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise, either with our products or historically with SAP, where they just can't continue like they did."

I'll add -- your question about services, we have pretty much made the migration away from on-premise implementations, where all of our staff is focused on cloud implementations. And during that transition, every time we go through one of these transitions, it looks like something isn't growing or worse yet, something is shrinking. Well, in this case, the on-premise stuff went down until it almost went away. And basically, all of the implementation services you see for applications are cloud implementations. We've now made the migration, and that should just grow steadily as demand for those systems increases.
We really don't have a lot of competition, that's the understatement of the year, in cloud ERP. And I'd love to know who the competitors are. SAP has -- doesn't have a product. When we bid -- we're in a competition with SAP right now, and we've just gotten -- we just found out we got -- we're a vendor of choice. And their big thing was, well, SAP doesn't have a cloud product. They have hosting. They're willing to put a custom computer in Amazon and just build a specialized version for the customer. That's not the cloud.
We update our application every 3 months. The entire fleet of 8,000 Fusion customers are updated every 3 months. The entire fleet of 28,000 NetSuite customers are updated every 6 months. You get SAP. They install it. And then they probably will update it again 5 years from now. It's an on-premise system. They don't have a cloud system. We're winning every deal against them, every one, and we're taking a lot of their customers away."

I would say it probably still remains open about Oracle, is can Oracle compete with database against Amazon. It's interesting question because Amazon doesn't really have it. And well, Amazon has like 13 separate databases where the Oracle data -- we do everything in a single database. We don't think an application should talk to 5 or 6 separate databases. We think it's a very risky security architecture.
But the question is, Amazon is the big leader in cloud, we're the big leader in databases, will -- if forced to choose, will they pick the Amazon Cloud and a database other than the Oracle Database. And -- or are they willing to move to migrate their Oracle applications to the Oracle Cloud to get the Oracle -- all the security and performance advantages of the Oracle database? That's been the big question out there. And is our cloud good enough to compete with Amazon and Google and Microsoft?
And I think we have answered those questions. It's not only good enough to compete. It's -- in many cases, it's much better for security, for performance, for reliability. We -- for cost. we're cheaper. And that's one of the reasons we have such a big ISV business. Well -- and so many people have left Amazon and come to the Oracle Cloud, was because we cost less. So we have significant cost advantages. And I think this is another big step to proving that the Oracle Cloud is part of the big 4. It's not a big 3. It's a big 4. I'm not including the Chinese players because they're regional -- not global. I'm counting the Gartner sequence, and the Gartner sequence is Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, Google.
And if we're in the big 4 and virtually every important database application on Earth runs -- I mean not every one, but the vast majority run on the Oracle database, those migrate to the Oracle Cloud, we have a very, very large business. And we're seeing people moving more and more things to the Oracle Cloud now, and this Gartner report will just help -- we'll move that along quite nicely.
By the way, it's not just the Gartner report. If they come and look and they run -- if they do a comparison, a straight-up comparison, us, Google; us, Amazon, they move -- they test the application in both places, we win all of those. It's when they don't come and look that we have a problem."

I'd like to just second that with an example in the past, recent history where when we bought NetSuite, we considered NetSuite strategic.

And so we made a number of investments in NetSuite, and we've seen their growth rate. NetSuite's gotten bigger obviously. But their growth rate has increased, and we've invested but we've made more money and we're growing faster in NetSuite. So I think that's the model that Safra likes to implement.

But our corporate -- we're seeing it now in our corporate customers as well. They move a workload. That works. They wait. They move 2 or 3 more workloads. That's continuing. So we think, again, this Gartner report is one more step in the right direction in terms of encouraging our corporate customers to move even more workloads and accelerate the rate.

I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue",1494,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue grew 6% in constant currency, above the high end of my guidance, with broad-based outperformance across the company. Q3 revenue growth looks like it will continue even higher, but let me save that for the guidance discussion. 
Earnings were also strong, with non-GAAP EPS $0.09 above the high end of my constant currency guidance. We achieved this outperformance despite the U.S. dollar strengthening since I gave guidance, as we saw a currency headwind of nearly $100 million to revenue and $0.01 to EPS. So the USD results, which are excellent and above guidance, are even stronger than they appear. Before I go through the numbers, though, I wanted to comment on what we are seeing in the market that is driving our accelerating revenue growth. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, we have a highly differentiated strategy from our competitors where we are the only company able to offer the combination of applications and infrastructure in the cloud. We have best-of-breed capabilities in both infrastructure and apps like HR and ERP, but also a highly differentiated set of industry-specific cloud SaaS applications. And of course, our second-generation cloud with autonomous database are unique in their performance, security and dependability. And because we have decades of experience in mission-critical systems, our customers can depend on us being up and available when they need us. 
Our unique capabilities are attracting customers, especially as they consider how to conduct their own digital transformation in the complex industries in which they compete. They want us to know as much about their business as they do, whether it's telco, financial services, utilities, retail and many others and to partner with them to modernize. Once a company thinks beyond simple dev test and other rudimentary cloud workloads and move their technology focus to mission-critical projects, they invariably turn to Oracle. 
Our focus on customer success is driving more references and new opportunities with both existing customers and with entirely new accounts. And of course, we ourselves are an Oracle Fusion full suite user. And I'm sure it is not lost on any of you and it's not lost on our prospects and customers that we are announcing our results 9 days after the quarter closed because of our systems and their embedded processes. 
Okay, back to the numbers. And from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. 
So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $10.7 billion and grew 22%, with cloud bookings growing faster than our cloud revenue growth rate. And as a result, we expect cloud revenue will accelerate further and exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s, potentially higher. 
GAAP application subscription revenues were $3.1 billion, up 8% organically in constant currency and our highest growth rate in 4 years. Fusion apps were up 30% with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $4.9 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP up 35%; Fusion HCM up 25%, and NetSuite ERP up 28%. 
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 50%. And I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will continue to ramp higher through the fiscal year. 
OCI consumption revenue, which includes autonomous database, was up 86% in constant currency. And total cloud customer revenue was up 45%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and data-based cloud services, were up 3% in constant currency. 
License revenues were $1.2 billion, up 16%, amongst our very best quarters over the last 10 years. And license growth was not dependent on any mega deals. We saw excellent performance in technology, our vertical businesses as well as North America and Latin American regions. 
So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up 6% in constant currency. 
Operating expenses were up 6% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and gross profit dollars grew 5% in constant currency. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to or better than last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, slightly higher than our base rate of 19. And earnings per share was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in constant currency. 
During the quarter, we recognized GAAP acquisition-related and other expenses totaling $4.7 billion, which substantially consisted of litigation-related charges that will not recur. They relate to a dispute that arose when we hired my former co-CEO in 2010. As a result of this onetime charge, GAAP net income was a negative $1.2 billion. The GAAP tax rate was 16.6% due to some discrete items. And the GAAP loss was $0.46 per share. 
Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $10.3 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $7.1 billion. Both results were negatively affected by the litigation charges I mentioned. 
Capital expenditures for the last 4 quarters were $3.1 billion, and CapEx for Q2 alone was $925 million. And we're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year.
We now have nearly $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is nearly $8 billion, up slightly in constant currency from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments, with gross deferred revenue growing 5% in constant currency. 
The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $37.2 billion, up 11% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. 
As we've said so many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 77 million shares for a total of $7 billion. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 47% at an average price that's about half the current share price. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion. We've paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. 
Now the guidance. I'm going to start by reiterating our expectation that full year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate from 2021 for all the reasons we've already seen so far this year. Given the strong performance in the first half, I now expect that we will see full year total revenue finish solidly in the mid-single digits, led by cloud revenue growth exiting the year in the mid-20s. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise, and I expect that our operating margins this year will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels of 44%.
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. I know you all saw that. And assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which we have no idea if they will or not, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 3% for revenue and $0.05 for EPS in Q3. Total revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Clearly, the midpoint of the range is 7%, and that is higher than the 6% we just reported in Q2 and higher than the 2% we reported in Q1. So everything is trending in the right direction. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in constant currency and between -- be between $1.19 and $1.23 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to grow between negative 2 and positive 2 in USD and be between $1.14 and $1.18 in USD. 
My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

All right, I'm going to discuss Oracle's cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today? I mean a lot of the people -- a lot of the companies like Microsoft did a great job of moving their entire Microsoft Office installed base into the cloud to dramatically increase the size of their cloud business. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same option or opportunity, so I think it's -- to me, I think you're going to find this interesting. 
So how big is our on-premise business today? Well, we had 7,500 customers in Oracle on-premise, their ERP made up of Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Only 1,000 of those 7,500 have moved to Fusion Cloud ERP. Now we have not lost any of these customers to competitors. We expect all the remaining 6,500 to move to Fusion ERP, but it hasn't happened yet. That's all upside. That's all upside. 
And I think a lot of people don't really realize that how -- so now let's migrate over and look at how big is our cloud ERP business today. Well, round number is $5 billion a year revenue, and we have 8,500 Fusion customers. But remember, only 1,000 of those 8,500 came from our old on-premise business. 6,500, plenty to come. 
So 7,500 of the 8,500 were not running Oracle ERP before we came out with our cloud product. Those are all new customers. Add to that the 28,000 new NetSuite customers. So Oracle has a total of 35,500 cloud ERP customers that are new to Oracle. Only 1,000 of our on-premise installed base has migrated so far. 
Now let me repeat that. 35,500 net new cloud ERP customers we got in the last few years. Only 1,000 from our installed base that's going to be coming to us later on. 
So how fast is cloud ERP revenue growing about? So growing about 30% a year. And so let's look out 5 years and ask the question, how big will we be in 5 years? And I think the number would be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating -- our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base, they're coming from someone else's installed base. And again, yes, -- 85% of our current -- that we have are from someone else's installed base. 
So what are our margins in this 5 year? Let's say, we're estimating $20 billion cloud ERP business. Well, it's scale, at that scale, that's about an 85% margin in that business. And as Safra pointed out earlier in her comments, the cloud business is inherently much more profitable and much more predictable than our old on-premise business. 
So we expect 5 years from now -- and again, these are just estimates. But based on our based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000, 5 years now, 30,000 Fusion customers plus 100,000 NetSuite customers bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. 
All right. So what's happening? I mean how are we winning so many new customers? Where are they coming from? Who are we competing? Well, we have -- really we only have 2 significant customers -- 2 competitors. We have 2 significant competitors, SAP and Workday. 
I've said this before. SAP did not build a true cloud product, and I'm going to explain what a true cloud product is in just a minute. But SAP, because they didn't build the cloud product, they bought some edge products around the cloud, but they didn't actually rebuild their software for the cloud. That's the same old 35-year-old software they've been selling forever. Their goal is simply to hold on to their installed base. but they are losing customers to us. 
This, for example, this quarter Petronas oil and gas -- big oil and gas customer moved over. We have -- I gave a long presentation about a couple of us taking already a couple of hundred pretty good-sized SAP customers. But so we're doing very well against SAP and continue to do it well. SAP. Winning Petronas and others this quarter. 
But Workday is very interesting because Workday does have a cloud product. And they've done quite well in HCM, but they have very few live. Try to go out and find live Workday ERP customers. Try to find any. 
So we're winning almost everything in cloud ERP. We're beating Workday 90 -- I don't know, 98% of the time, we beat Workday. We -- and we're taking customers from SAP's installed base. They're still winning -- holding on to more of their base than we're taking, but we're making inroads. 
So again, what's going on? Why are we winning? Well, we're winning because we have a true cloud product that is very, very feature-rich. -- and [ burberry] has a very low cost of ownership. So it's enormously capable, and it's not expensive compared with the old on-premise systems. 
Our implementations, I mean we've got implementations of medium, large companies that sometimes takes 6 months. Now don't get me wrong. Someone like Bank of America took a few years. That was an SAP customer that we won. And that was just doing the Merrill Lynch division. It took a few years. And then hopefully, we're going to continue to make progress at Bank of America. 
So we have In general, it's much faster and lower cost to implement our cloud product than implement, let's say, SAP or even Workday in, but much -- but a gigantic difference with was SAP. Very easy to use. We have the user interface. There's 2 aspects. There's the computer interface that works on mobile phones and tablets and things like that. 
And then we have a voice digital assistant. You talk to our applications. You talk to all of our applications. You ask for reports. You ask questions. And I think it's like Alexa for the enterprise. All our apps run on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every app. Not a handful of apps are mobile; every single app runs on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every single app has a voice interface 
We have -- and this is what I mean by a true cloud product. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers, for Fusion. every 3 months. That's right. They get a new version with some hundreds or sometimes even thousands of new features. Every 3 months, they get that. 
Now why is that important? Well, I mean because our customers want -- specifically in different industry, they don't want -- they don't all want the same new feature depending on the industry you're in, depending on your size, depending on the country you're in, your 3 most important new features, the features you must have, are different among a lot of different customers. 
So in the old days with SAP, customers built this themselves. They went out and hired Accenture or somebody else, IBM Services when it was IBM Services to build these features for them. Now the new model is don't customize your product. You don't have to. Give us your list of new features that you need and we'll build them and put them in the next release. And we can build them faster than you can. And you might have to wait 3 months or 4 months or 5 months before you get a new version. But you get them quickly. And we're the ones that build them. 
And they're part of the standard product. They are not some customization you have to maintain forever. So they're not expensive. In fact, they're free. They come with the product. 
This is radically different than what SAP offers in their and what they call their cloud product, which I say is not a true cloud product because they don't have new versions every 3 months. They don't have new versions every 3 years in their so-called cloud product. You make all the same modifications you used to make by hiring people and customize. 
That's not the new model. That's not how it works in a real cloud system. That's a fundamental -- and every time they go in and modify the system, what if they make a mistake? What if they have a bug? That's going to make the system less reliable and more expensive, potentially slower. 
That doesn't happen with real cloud systems. We, the vendor, are responsible for enhancing it and testing it on a regular cadence and responding to their requirements and delivering things to them in months, not years. We're also on schedule to deliver some unprecedented new technology. We won't be long before when our customers upgrade every 3 months, they upgrade. And sometimes they're down for an hour or so, and we're going to -- we're on schedule to deliver zero downtime upgrades. 
So it won't be long now when our customers move to the new version, there'll be no downtime. Nobody else has this. Nobody else is working on. 
And soon, all of our applications will be on the autonomous self-tuning maximum security database. I've said this before, what's the most important thing about the autonomous database? The money you save because there's no human labor. No actually, the money is -- the money you have to save is no human labor is good. But no human labor, no human errors, no security risks, no stolen data. Almost all of the -- not all, but almost all of the data that's been hacked out of other clouds has been happening because some human being made a mistake, let a port open created a vulnerability. 
You can't do that with the autonomous database because human beings don't touch it. it is -- just like a self-driving car is safer than a car driven by human being, a self-driving database is much safer and more secure than a database that is managed by human beings who make mistakes and cause problems. 
Okay. So I'll stop there and let turn a little bit describe what's going on in the marketplace kind of on an industry perspective. Fusion ERP has been out for a while, and we are beginning to roll up entire industries. We're adding the features for banking. 
I think on an earlier quarterly call, I said our 2 largest investment strategic industries going forward in ERP would be banking and health care. Not maybe not just ERP but for the company in total, will be banking and health care. And we're doing extremely well in those industries. Some of our live banking and financial service customers include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, State Street, NatWest, Santander, Macquarie. I can go on and on and on with a long list of banks all over the world. 
But also we have insurance customers, USAA, Nationwide, AAA and again and a lot more. I'm not going to list everybody. In fact, we provide a printed list at the end of every quarter of our all the new wins we had in the quarter. 
And we had a lot of new logos in banking and financial services in Q2. We won Barclays. That was another big bank that we won. First Bank, in insurance. We won Ameritas, MoneyGram. And we had some major go-lives, huge go-lives at MetLife, Blackstone and Assurant. We're doing very well in financial services and specifically banking. 
Healthcare, the other industry I identified as being strategic and above the -- and on par with banking in terms of the importance of our -- to our future. So large health care customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Provident St. Jo. I would say that we have a lot of health care wins around the world, but I'd say our health care wins are concentrated more in North America as compared with banking. New health care wins this quarter: Mayo Clinic, the #1 brand hospital in the United States; [ High Markel; Syneos Health and PPD. ] Again, I can go on and on, but again we print those out for you, and you can read them at your leisure.
Let me talk about one other industry before I give my closing remarks. That's logistics customers. We've become very, very strong with logistics customers. FedEx was a key win to us, take away from SAP. UPS, we have UPS, DHL, FedEx, DP World, TTS. I can go on and on. We have most of the big logistics companies around the world, around the world. 
And FedEx, which is -- a lot of our companies aren't through rolling out Oracle Fusion ERP. But Fedex, for example, is now live in 98 countries. 
We're winning in lots of other industries as well, but I wanted to highlight these 3 industries because they are essential to our plan to add major new capabilities to our cloud ERP system. Before I describe these capabilities, I have a confession to make. 
We are not -- I don't believe it myself. We are not on our way to building a $20 billion cloud ERP business in 5 years. I think it's going to be a lot bigger than that. Let me explain why. 
As more and more companies adopt and run Oracle Cloud ERP, I ask the question, what does a B2B procurement transaction look like? In other words, how does it work when one Oracle Cloud ERP system is talking to another Oracle Cloud ERP system and placing an order? We are working in concert with our banking and logistics partners to originate purchase financing, products shipped, delivery tracking, invoicing and payments right inside the 2 transacting Oracle Cloud ERP procurement systems. 
Oracle Cloud ERP will soon bring an entirely new level of automation to B2B commerce, one that very much resembles the ease of doing business and efficiency of B2C e-commerce. This new ERP automation system, all these new capabilities will dramatically simplify our customers' procurement and supply chain processes. And as such, it represents a huge new opportunity for Oracle to grow its cloud ERP ecosystem. 
Thank you. Back to Safra."

But I wanted to ask you about OCI because we continue to hear great things from customers. And I think people understand Oracle's cloud is hypersecure, highly automated, and there's real price/performance advantage. 
But as we think about your product road map and what it takes for Oracle to capture more than its fair share of the broader public cloud market, how much are you investing in breadth versus depth? Because we just see in this quarter alone, like the partnership with Airtel in India, Orange in West Africa, new regions in Singapore, UAE, France, and I'm probably missing some. But clearly there's demand. Otherwise, I know Safra wouldn't be making these investments. But when a new competitor [ puts ] -- Larry, when your main competitor posts over 200 services up the stack, how far should we expect to see you build up the stack competing on functionality, versus continuing to go broad with what you already have?"

We have applications. So -- but I know you want to talk about this. Yes, you want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as 2 separate businesses, but of course, they're not. I me",803,"Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So -- but I know you want to talk about this. Yes, you want to talk about infrastructure. 
We think of those as 2 separate businesses, but of course, they're not. I mean everyone who is running Oracle ERP is building data warehouses on top of their ERP data. They're mashing it up maybe with Salesforce data. They're doing all of these things. They're doing a combination of big application customers. Bank of America, for example, is doing a combination of running our apps and building bespoke apps around those. So this is a huge opportunity for us that are other infrastructure customers, other infrastructure providers don't have. 
We've often had the discussion: do we want to support 10 databases, or do we want to support 30 databases? And do we want to have every single service that let's say an Amazon has? 
And I think our view is we want to have some really good choices but not every single choice on the menu. We want to have all of the popular databases but not some of the obscure databases. So we are not going to try to feature match every single thing they do. 
We will, however, have development environments they don't have at all. So if you're building data warehouses on top of Fusion ERP or on top of Fusion HCM or on top of NetSuite, we have a whole set of tools that makes that easy for you over on the infrastructure side of our business. So we have some -- we do -- we have all the popular stuff around. I mean obviously, you have Kubernetes and the like. But -- and we have [ post grass] and the popular databases. We have MySQL, but our version of MySQL is much better than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's much faster. I mean more than 10x faster because of [ way]. We have this query optimized that they don't have at all. So our idea is to look at the most popular products, to have recommended development environments and recommended systems, and be able to do things they can't do at all. 
I think one other -- let me mention one of these fundamental differences in our strategy versus their strategy. They are building a small number of very, very large data centers. Our strategy is to build a large number of smaller, less expensive data centers. We think that improves reliability dramatically. We don't have this giant data center going down. It reduces the blast radius of what happens when things go down. Less goes down. It allows us to go into sovereign nations in some smaller countries that they can't -- never afforded to put a data center in. And we could not put 1  but 2, a primary and a backup data center in sovereign countries that care about data sovereignty. 
We can put a complete cloud. I don't mean just database cloud. I mean a complete cloud at a customer like NRI in Japan. And we did that with that -- we put in a primary and a backup. 
So we can -- if people want to run a cloud, if a large financial institution wants to run our cloud inside their firewall, inside their data center, we can do that. And how will that cloud differ from the cloud that we run in the public? It won't differ at all. We can make that small enough, we can -- that we can fit it into their data center. Nobody else can do this. 
So we think we -- and then let me close with a note that I'm going to paraphrase from a very large telecommunications company who uses our cloud and all the other 3 North American clouds, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. And the note basically said, the one thing we've noticed about Oracle, Oracle Cloud is that it never ever goes down. We can't say that about any of the other clouds. We think this is a critical differentiator availability. 
Another critical differentiator is security, where we have -- where the only way you can achieve security, I promise you this is true, is through autonomy. If you have human beings deploying and tinkering with your systems, they can make mistakes that expose your data. The only way we've been able to solve that problem is to get human beings out of the equation. No human beings, no human error, no human malice. 
So we think we have a bunch of differentiators. And we'll be able to compete very, very effectively with security, reliability, combination of apps and infrastructure autonomy and a bunch of other things the other guys just will not be able to do.."

Installing the product, making it very easy to configure, having -- I think our -- the consulting infrastructure, the implementers around our products now are much more experienced.

So the cost of putting one of these things in has dropped precipitously. The time it takes to put it in, obviously related to the cost, has also dropped precipitously. The -- there's just no comparison to the way it used to be to the way it is now.
Well, the way it used to be a customer bought his own unique computer configuration and added some modifications to the ERP system and installed it over a period of -- I mean it wasn't unusual back in the day for an SAP implementation to take 5 to 7 years. Now I know it sounds crazy, but some of them -- and cost billions, billions of dollars. 
Now for a medium-sized company, 6 months is not unreasonable to get you live on -- maybe not your entire business, but financials and procurement and a big chunk of your business, we can get live very, very quickly at a very, very low cost. So it's just a totally different world.
And then the other thing I'm going to mention one more time. Customers are not encouraged to go ahead and build their own extensions. If you need an extension, tell us what you need, and maybe we can schedule it in the next quarter or 2 in the upcoming releases. That's a fundamentally different model. It's so much less expensive to have us do it for nothing, than to try to do it yourself."

In fact, we built 2 versions of our cloud, right? We built version 1, which we weren't very happy with. And then we built our Gen 2 cloud. 
And one of the things that we decided, as we had a chance to rearchitect it, we were sensitive to -- we needed special high -- super high security zones for government. We need to build a lot of data centers. 
And we -- and the magic to building a lot of data centers is twofold. One is compressing the software to a smallish number of servers. But that's really not it. It's really the art of being able to operate a lot of smaller data centers without people or with very few people. 
Think about what Elon Musk did with his satellite system. Why was he able to build a low earth orbiting satellite system, and nobody else? And a lot of other people have tried, but no one else could. Because he figured -- he built the software to manage thousands of satellites. 
No one else could do it. No one else could do it. Other people couldn't do it. That's why they kind of failed in the past. 
We -- our automation software for rolling out and managing a large number of data centers is very different software that you would build for managing a small number of super large data center where you had a lot of people. So we've relied much more heavily on automation to do this. And Safra don't talk about it because it wasn't easy. It took us a while. And we were worried -- and we've made a bunch of commitments. And the only way we can meet all those commitments was to have fully automated, lights-out data center, cloud data centers. 
And we -- the team did a fantastic job prioritizing that automation. And that automation software is what allows us to have a large number of data centers rather than a small number of large data centers. It's just a different suite of software to do it, to manage it."

I hear people talk about hybrid cloud. So a hybrid cloud means there's someone's public cloud. then whatever you have in your data center is the hybrid. This is ridiculous. That",260,"Yes, a lot of people talk about -- they talk about -- I think it's hilarious. I hear people talk about hybrid cloud. So a hybrid cloud means there's someone's public cloud. then whatever you have in your data center is the hybrid. This is ridiculous. That's not a cloud. People say, well, that's the most common cloud there is, whatever you got plus some link to a public cloud. That is not a hybrid cloud. 
We offer identical hardware, the identical automation software. We'll put a region. It will -- it runs all of our apps, it runs all of our services, 100% of them. And we'll put it in your data center. We can do that now because we can run that -- we can run -- we have the automation software to run that on your floor behind your firewall. We can build that. So it's true. 
So our notion of the hybrid cloud is basically the same thing, but it's located on your data center floor behind your firewall, with high-speed network interconnects where you're comfortable and feel safe, safer than if you were in the public cloud. That's the only hybrid thing about it. Otherwise, it's exactly the same thing. You can move a workload from a public cloud into your private region and then back out of your product region back in the public cloud. They are identical in every way except for the security protection and firewalls in your private data center. That's a real hybrid cloud. The other guys don't have it."

So I guess my question is there's -- there seems to be something going on in the data world and the data infrastructure stack. And obviously when Oracle moves at the -- at your scale at these percentages, there definitely seems to be something going on. So what is that? And how do you think about the sustainability of those drivers?"

So -- but remember, when people buy the Oracle database licenses, they can bring those to our cloud, and that's a very economical way to operate. 
And really, what's going on is huge amounts of data growing exponentially. And when it's important data, especially data you want to use for analysis, for data warehousing, for transactions, you're going to pick Oracle in 9 times out of 10. And so this is great for us.

22247,1760389758,2459451,"Oracle Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2021",2021-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest-growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue",1492,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest-growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue grew 6% in constant currency, above the high end of my guidance, with broad-based outperformance across the company. Q3 revenue growth looks like it will continue even higher, but let me save that for the guidance discussion. 
Earnings were also strong with non-GAAP EPS $0.09 above the high end of my constant currency guidance. We achieved this outperformance despite the U.S. dollar strengthening since I gave guidance as we saw a currency headwind of nearly $100 million to revenue and $0.01 to EPS. So the USD results, which are excellent and above guidance, are even stronger than they appear. 
Before I go through the numbers, though, I wanted to comment on what we are seeing in the market that is driving our accelerating revenue growth. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we have a highly differentiated strategy from our competitors where we are the only company able to offer the combination of applications and infrastructure in the cloud. We have best-of-breed capabilities in both infrastructure and apps, like HR and ERP, but also a highly differentiated set of industry-specific cloud SaaS applications. And of course, our second-generation cloud with autonomous database are unique in their performance, security and dependability. And because we have decades of experience in mission-critical systems, our customers can depend on us being up and available when they need us. 
Our unique capabilities are attracting customers, especially as they consider how to conduct their own digital transformation in the complex industries in which they compete. They want us to know as much about their business as they do, whether it's telco, financial services, utilities, retail and many others and to partner with them to modernize. Once a company thinks beyond simple dev test and other rudimentary cloud workloads and move their technology focus to mission-critical projects, they invariably turn to Oracle. 
Our focus on customer success is driving more references and new opportunities with both existing customers and with entirely new accounts. And of course, we, ourselves, are an Oracle Fusion full suite user, and I'm sure it is not lost on any of you and it's not lost on our prospects and customers that we are announcing our results 9 days after the quarter closed because of our systems and their embedded processes. 
Okay, back to the numbers. And from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, Unless I say otherwise. 
So total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $10.7 billion and grew 22% with cloud bookings growing faster than our cloud revenue growth rate. And as a result, we expect cloud revenue will accelerate further and exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s, potentially higher. 
GAAP application subscription revenues were $3.1 billion, up 8% organically in constant currency and our highest growth rate in 4 years. Fusion Apps were up 30% with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $4.9 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP, up 35%; Fusion HCM, up 25%; and NetSuite ERP, up 28%. 
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 50%. I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will continue to ramp higher through the fiscal year. 
OCI consumption revenue, which includes autonomous database, was up 86% in constant currency. And total cloud customer revenue was up 45%. 
Database subscription revenues, including database support and data-based cloud services, were up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.2 billion, up 16%, amongst our very best quarters over the last 10 years. And license growth was not dependent on any mega deals. We saw excellent performance in technology, our vertical businesses as well as North America and Latin American regions. 
So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up 6% in constant currency. 
Operating expenses were up 6% this quarter. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 84%, and gross profit dollars grew 5% in constant currency. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for Cloud Services and License Support will be similar to or better than last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, slightly higher than our base rate of 19%. And earnings per share was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in constant currency. 
During the quarter, we recognized GAAP acquisition-related and other expenses totaling $4.7 billion which substantially consisted of litigation-related charges that will not recur. They relate to a dispute that arose when we hired my former co-CEO in 2010. As a result of this onetime charge, GAAP net income was a negative $1.2 billion. The GAAP tax rate was 16.6% due to some discrete item, and the GAAP loss was $0.46 per share. 
Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $10.3 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $7.1 billion. Both results were negatively affected by the litigation charges I mentioned. 
Capital expenditures for the last 4 quarters were $3.1 billion, and CapEx for Q2 alone was $925 million. And we're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. 
We now have nearly $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is nearly $8 billion, up slightly in constant currency from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments, with gross deferred revenue growing 5% in constant currency. 
The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $37.2 billion, up 11% in constant currency, due to strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. 
As we've said so many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 77 million shares for a total of $7 billion. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 47% at an average price that's about half the current share price. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion. We've paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share.
Now the guidance. I'm going to start by reiterating our expectation that full year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate from 2021 for all the reasons we've already seen so far this year. Given the strong performance in the first half, I now expect that we will see full year total revenue finish solidly in the mid-single digits, led by cloud revenue growth exiting the year in the mid-20s. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise, and I expect that our operating margins this year will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. 
Let me now turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. I know you all saw that. And assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which we have no idea if they will or not, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 3% for revenue and $0.05 for EPS in Q3. Total revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Clearly, the midpoint of the range is 7%, and that is higher than the 6% we just reported in Q2 and higher than the 2% we reported in Q1. So everything is trending in the right direction. Cloud Service and License Support revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in constant currency and between -- be between $1.19 and $1.23 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to grow between negative 2% and positive 2% in USD and be between $1.14 and $1.18 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I'm going to discuss Oracle's cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today?

All right. I'm going to discuss Oracle's cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today? I mean, a lot of the people -- a lot of the companies, like Microsoft, did a great job of moving their entire Microsoft Office install base into the cloud to dramatically increase the size of their cloud business. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same option or opportunity, so I think -- to me, I think you're going to find this interesting. 
So how big is our on-premise business today? Well, we had 7,500 customers in Oracle on-premise. Their ERP, made up of E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Only 1,000 of those 7,500 have moved to Fusion Cloud ERP. Now we have not lost any of these customers to competitors. We expect all the remaining 6,500 to move to Fusion ERP, but it hasn't happened yet. That's all upside. That's all upside, and I think a lot of people don't really realize that how -- so now let's migrate over and look at how big is our cloud ERP business today. Well, round number is $5 billion a year revenue, and we have 8,500 Fusion customers. But remember, only 1,000 of those 8,500 came from our old on-premise business. 6,500, plenty to come. 
So 7,500 of these 8,500 were not running Oracle ERP before we came out with our cloud product. Those are all new customers, add to that the 28,000 new NetSuite customers. So Oracle has a total of 35,500 cloud ERP customers that are new to Oracle. Only 1,000 of our on-premise install base has migrated so far. Let me repeat that. 35,500 net new cloud ERP customers we got in the last few years, only 1,000 from our installed base. That's going to be coming to us later on. 
So how fast is cloud ERP revenue growing about? So growing about 30% a year. And so let's look out 5 years and ask the question: How big will we be in 5 years? And I think the number is going to be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating -- our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base. They're coming from someone else's installed base. And again, yes, 85% of our current -- that we have are from someone else's installed base. 
So what are our margins in this 5 year -- let's say, we're estimating $20 billion cloud ERP business. Well, it's scale. At that scale, that's about an 85% margin in that business. And as Safra pointed out earlier in her comments, the cloud business is inherently much more profitable and much more predictable than our old on-premise business. So we expect 5 years from now -- and again, these are just estimates. But based on our based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000 -- 5 years from now, 30,000 Fusion customers, plus 100,000 NetSuite customers, bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. 
All right. So what's happening? I mean, how are we winning so many new customers? Where are they coming from? Who are we competing? Well, we have -- really, we only have 2 significant customers -- 2 competitors, 2 significant competitors: SAP and Workday. I've said this before. SAP did not build a true cloud product, and I'm going to explain what a true cloud product is in just a minute. But SAP, because they didn't build the cloud product, they bought some edge products around the cloud, but they didn't actually rebuild their software for the cloud. That's the same old 35-year-old software they've been selling forever. Their goal is simply to hold on to their installed base, but they are losing customers to us. This -- for example, this quarter Petronas, oil and gas -- big oil and gas customer moved over -- we have -- I gave a long presentation about a couple of us taking already a couple of hundred pretty good-sized SAP customers. But -- so we're doing very well against SAP and continue to do it well, SAP, winning Petronas and others this quarter. 
But Workday is very interesting because Workday does have a cloud product, and they've done quite well in HCM, but they have very few live. Try to find -- try to go and find live Workday ERP customers. Try to find any. So we're winning almost everything in cloud ERP. We're beating Workday -- I don't know, 98% of the time, we beat Workday. We -- and we're taking customers from SAP's installed base. They're still winning -- holding on to more of their base than we're taking, but we're making inroads. 
So again, what's going on? Why are we winning? Well, we're winning because we have a true cloud product that is very, very feature-rich and very, very -- has a very low cost of ownership. So it's enormously capable, and it's not expensive compared with the old on-premise systems. 
Our implementations, I mean, we've got implementations of medium, large companies that sometimes take 6 months. Now don't get me wrong. Someone like Bank of America took a few years. That was an SAP customer that we won, and that was just doing the Merrill Lynch division, took a few years. And then hopefully, we're going to continue to make progress at Bank of America. So we have -- in general, it's much faster and lower cost to implement our cloud product than to implement, let's say, SAP or even Workday. But much -- a gigantic difference with SAP. 
Very easy to use. We have the user interface. There's 2 aspects. There's the computer interface that works on mobile phones and tablets and things like that, and then we have a voice digital assistant. You talk to our applications. You talk to all of our applications. You ask for reports. You ask questions. And I think it's like Alexa for the enterprise. All our apps run on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every app. Not a handful of apps are mobile. Every single app runs on smartphones, tablets, desktops. Every single app has a voice interface. 
We have -- and this is what I mean by a true cloud product. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers, for Fusion. every 3 months. That's right. They get a new version with some -- hundreds or sometimes even thousands of new features. Every 3 months, they get that. 
Now why is that important? Well, I mean, because our customers want -- specifically in different industry, they don't want -- they don't all want the same new feature, depending on the industry you're in, depending on your size, depending on the country you're in, your 3 most important new features, new features you must have are different among a lot of different customers. 
So in the old days with SAP, customers built this themselves. They went out and hired Accenture or somebody else, IBM Services when it was IBM Services, to build these features for them. Now the new model is -- you don't customize your product. You don't have to. Give us your list of new features that you need, and we'll build them and put them in the next release. And we can build them faster than you can. And you might have to wait 3 months or 4 months or 5 months before you get them a new version, but you get them quickly. And we're the ones that build them. And they're part of the standard product. They are not some customization that you have to maintain forever. So they're not expensive. In fact, they're free. They come with the product. 
This is radically different than what SAP offers in their -- in what they call their cloud product, which I say is not a true cloud product because they don't have new versions every 3 months. They don't have new versions every 3 years in their so-called cloud product. You make all the same modifications you used to make by hiring people and customize. That's not the new model. That's not how it works in a real cloud system. That's a fundamental -- and every time they go in and modify the system, what if they make a mistake? What if they have a bug? That's going to make the system less reliable and more expensive, potentially slower. That doesn't happen with real cloud systems. We, the vendor, are responsible for enhancing it and then testing it on a regular cadence and responding to their requirements and delivering things to them in months, not years. 
We're also on schedule to deliver some unprecedented new technology. We -- won't be long before when our customers upgrade every 3 months, they upgrade. And sometimes, they're down for an hour or so, and we're going to -- we're on schedule to deliver 0 downtime upgrades. So it won't be long now when our customers move to the new version. There'll be no downtime. Nobody else has this. Nobody else is working on. 
And soon, all of our applications will be on the autonomous self-tuning maximum security database. I've said this before, what's the most important thing about the autonomous database? The money you save because there's no human labor. No, actually, the money -- it's good. The money you have to save because there's no human labor is good. But no human labor, no human errors, no security risks, no stolen data. Almost all of the -- not all, but almost all of the data that's been hacked out of other clouds has been happening because some human being made a mistake, left the port open, created a vulnerability. You can't do that with the autonomous database because human beings don't touch it. It is -- just like a self-driving car is safer than a car driven by a human being. A self-driving database is much safer and more secure than a database that is managed by human beings who make mistakes and cause problems. 
Okay. So I'll stop there, and I'm going to slightly turn a little bit and describe what's going on in the marketplace kind of on an -- from an industry perspective. Fusion ERP has been around -- out for a while, and we are beginning to roll up entire industries. We're adding the features for banking. I think on an earlier quarterly call, I said our 2 largest investment strategic industries, going forward, in ERP would be banking and health care. Not -- maybe not just ERP, but for the company in total will be banking and health care, and we're doing extremely well in those industries. Some of our live banking and financial service customers include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, State Street, NatWest, Santander, Macquarie. I can go on and on and on with a long list of banks all over the world. But also, we have insurance customers: USAA, Nationwide, AAA and again -- and a lot more. I'm not going to list everybody. In fact, we provide a printed list at the end of every quarter of our -- all the new wins we had in the quarter. 
And we had a lot of new logos in banking and financial services in Q2. We won Barclays. That was another big bank that we won. First Bank. In insurance, we won Ameritas, MoneyGram. And we had some major go-lives, huge go-lives at MetLife, Blackstone and Assurant. We're doing very well in financial services and specifically banking. 
Health care, the other industry I identified as being strategic and above the -- and on par with banking in terms of the importance of our -- to our future. So large health care customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Providence St. Jo. I would say that we have a lot of health care wins around the world, but I'd say our health care wins are concentrated more in North America as compared with banking. New health care wins this quarter: Mayo Clinic, the #1 hospital in the United States; Highmark Health; Syneos Health; and PPD. Again, I can go on and on. But again, we print those out for you, and you can read them at your leisure.
Let me talk about one other industry before I give my closing remarks, and that's logistics customers. We've become very, very strong with logistics customers. FedEx was a key win from us, takeaway from SAP. UPS. We have UPS, DHL, FedEx, DP World, TTS. I can go on and on. We have most of the big logistics companies around the world. And FedEx, which is -- a lot of our companies aren't through rolling out Oracle Fusion ERP. But Fedex, for example, is now live in 98 countries. 
We're winning in lots of other industries as well, but I wanted to highlight these 3 industries because they are essential to our plan to add major new capabilities to our cloud ERP system. 
Before I describe these capabilities, I have a confession to make. We are not -- I don't believe it. We are not on our way to building a $20 billion cloud ERP business in 5 years. I think it's going to be a lot bigger than that. Let me explain why. 
As more and more companies adopt and run Oracle Cloud ERP, I ask the question: What does a B2B procurement transaction look like? In other words, how does it work when one Oracle Cloud ERP system is talking to another Oracle Cloud ERP system and placing an order? We are working in concert with our banking and logistics partners to originate purchase financing, products shipped, delivery tracking, invoicing and payments right inside the 2 transacting Oracle Cloud ERP procurement system. Oracle Cloud ERP will soon bring an entirely new level of automation to B2B commerce, one that very much resembles the ease of doing business and efficiency of B2C e-commerce. 
This new ERP automation system, all these new capabilities will dramatically simplify our customers' procurement and supply chain processes. And as such, it represents a huge new opportunity for Oracle to grow its cloud ERP ecosystem. 
Thank you. Back to Safra."

But I wanted to ask you about OCI because we continue to hear great things from customers. And I think people understand Oracle's cloud is hyper secure, highly automated, and there's real price/performance advantage. 
But as we think about your product's road map and what it takes for Oracle to capture more than its fair share of the broader public cloud market, how much are you investing in breadth versus depth? Because we just see in this quarter alone, like the partnership with Airtel in India, Orange in West Africa, new regions in Singapore, UAE, France, and I'm probably missing some. But clearly, there's demand. Otherwise, I know Safra wouldn't be making these investments. But when a new competitor posts -- Larry, when your main competitor posts over 200 services up the stack, how far should we expect to see you build up the stack competing on functionality versus continuing to go broad with what you already have?"
22247,1760389758,2459451,"Oracle Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 09, 2021",2021-12-09,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So -- but I know you don't want to talk about OCI. You want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as 2 separate businesses. But of course, they're not. I mean",792,"Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So -- but I know you don't want to talk about OCI. You want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as 2 separate businesses. But of course, they're not. I mean, everyone who is running Oracle ERP is building data warehouses on top of their ERP data. They're mashing it up maybe with Salesforce data. They're doing all of these things. They're doing a combination of big application customers. Bank of America, for example, is doing a combination of running our apps and building bespoke apps around those. So this is a huge opportunity for us that our other infrastructure customers -- other infrastructure providers don't have. 
We've often had the discussion: Do we want to support 10 databases? Or do we want to support 30 databases? And do we want to have every single service that, let's say, an Amazon has? And I think our view is we want to have some really good choices but not every single choice on the menu. We want to have all of the popular databases but not some of the obscure databases, so we are not going to try to feature-match every single thing they do. 
We will, however, have development environments they don't have at all. So if you're building data warehouses on top of Fusion ERP or on top of Fusion HCM or on top of NetSuite, we have a whole set of tools that makes that easy for you over on the infrastructure side of our business. So we have some -- we do -- we have all the popular stuff around. I mean, obviously, you have Kubernetes and the like. But -- and we have PostgreSQL and the popular databases. We have MySQL, but our version of MySQL is much better than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's much faster, I mean, more than 10x faster because of HeatWave. We have this query optimizer they don't have at all. 
So our idea is to look at the most popular products, to have recommended development environments and recommended systems and be able to do things they can't do at all. 
I think one other -- let me mention one of the fundamental differences in our strategy versus their strategy. They are building a small number of very, very large data centers. Our strategy is to build a large number of smaller, less expensive data centers. We think that improves reliability dramatically. We won't have this giant data center going down. It reduces the blast radius of what happens when things go down. Less goes down. It allows us to go into sovereign nations, in some smaller countries that they can't -- never afford to put a data center in. And we can now put 1 but 2 primary and a backup data center in sovereign countries that care about data sovereignty. We can put a complete cloud. I don't mean just database cloud. I mean, a complete cloud at a customer like NRI in Japan, and we did that. With that, we put in a primary and a backup. 
So we can -- if people want to run a cloud, if a large financial institution wants to run our cloud inside their firewall, inside their data center, we can do that. And how will that cloud differ from the cloud that we run in the public? It won't differ at all. We can make that small enough. We can it into their data center. Nobody else can do this. 
So we think we -- and then let me close with a note that I'm going to paraphrase from a very large telecommunications company who uses our cloud and all the other 3 North American clouds: Google, Amazon and Microsoft. And the note basically said the one thing we've noticed about Oracle, Oracle's Cloud, is that it never ever goes down. We can't say that about any of the other clouds. We think this is a critical differentiator, availability. 
Another critical differentiator is security, where we have -- where the only way you can achieve security, I promise you this is true, is through autonomy. If you have human beings deploying and tinkering with your systems, they can make mistakes that expose your data. The only way we've been able to solve that problem is to get human beings out of the equation. No human beings, no human error, no human malice. 
So we think we have a bunch of differentiators, and we'll be able to compete very, very effectively with security, reliability, combination of apps and infrastructure autonomy and a bunch of other things the other guys just will not be able to do."

So -- but the real answer is the fact that I'm sure you've seen Gartner's scorecard where we actually passed Google this year and are higher than where Microsoft, who's been in this longer than us, was a year ago.

The products have gotten much better. Our -- the people have got more experience. The customers themselves have gotten more experience. So the cost of putting one of these things in has dropped precipitously. The time it takes to put it in, obviously related to the cost, has also dropped precipitously. The -- there's just no comparison to the way it used to be the way it is now.
Well, the way it used to be, a customer bought his own unique computer configuration and added some modifications to the ERP system and installed it over a period of -- I mean, it wasn't unusual back in the day for an SAP implementation to take 5 to 7 years. Now I know it sounds crazy, but some of them -- and cost billions of dollars. 
Now for a medium-sized company, 6 months is not unreasonable to get you live on -- maybe not your entire business, but financials and procurement and a big chunk of your business, we can get live very, very quickly at a very, very low cost. So it's just a totally different world.
And then the other thing I'm going to mention one more time. Customers are not encouraged to go ahead and build their own extensions. If you need an extension, tell us what you need, and maybe we can schedule it in the next quarter or 2 in the upcoming releases. That's a fundamentally different model. It's so much less expensive to have us do it for nothing than to try to do it yourself."

In fact, we built 2 versions of our cloud, right? We built version 1, which we weren't very happy with. And then we built Gen2 -- our Gen2 cloud. 
And one of the things that we decided -- as we had a chance to rearchitect it, we were sensitive to -- we needed special high -- super high security zones for government. We need to build a lot of data centers. And we -- and the magic to building a lot of data centers is twofold. One is compressing the software to a smallish number of servers, but that's really not it. It's really the -- being able to operate all -- a lot of smaller data centers without people or with very few people. 
Think about what Elon Musk did with his satellite system. Why was he able to build a low Earth orbiting satellite system and nobody else? A lot of other people have tried, but no one else could because he figured out -- he built a software to manage thousands of satellites. No one else could do it. NASA couldn't do it. Other people couldn't do it. That's why they kind of failed in the past. 
We -- the -- our automation software for rolling out and managing a large number of data centers is a very different software that you would build for managing a small number of super large data center where you had a lot of people. So we've relied much more heavily on automation to do this. And Safra doesn't talk about it because it wasn't easy. It took us a while. And we were worried -- and we've made a bunch of commitments. And the only way we can meet all those commitments was to have fully automated, lights-out data center, cloud data centers. And we -- the team did a fantastic job prioritizing that automation, and that automation software is what allows us to have a large number of data centers rather than a small number of large data centers. It's just a different -- it's a different suite of software to do it, to manage it."

This is ridiculous. That's not a cloud. People say, ""Well, that's the most common cloud there is, whatever you got, plus some link to a public cloud."" That is not a hybrid cloud. 
We offer the identical hardware, the identical automation software. We'll put a region. It will -- it runs all of our apps, runs all of our services, 100% of them. And we'll put it in your data center. We can do that now because we can run that -- we can run -- we have the automation software to run that on your floor behind your firewall. We can build that. So it's true. 
So our notion of a hybrid cloud is basically the same thing, but it's located on your data center floor behind your firewall with high-speed network interconnects where you're comfortable and feel safe, safer than if you were in the public cloud. That's the only hybrid-ey thing about it. Otherwise, it's exactly the same thing. You can move a workload from the public -- from a public cloud into your private region and then back out of your product region back in the public cloud. They are identical in every way, except for the security protection and firewalls in your private data center. That's a real hybrid cloud. The other guys don't have it."

I mean, listen, this is not new news in that what is going on is getting insights from data, being able to capture large amounts of data and analyzing it. And of course, that's coming and so much of it is in Oracle. We're the ones who can handle high performance, high-reliability requirements. And the Oracle database continues to grow. 
But in addition, we have the other technologies that are also doing very well. Java continues to be incredibly strong, and it's leading application development environment. So -- but remember, when people buy the Oracle database licenses, they can bring those to our cloud, and that's a very economical way to operate. 
And really, what's going on is huge amounts of data growing exponentially. And when it's important data, especially data you want to use for analysis, for data warehousing, for transactions, you're going to pick Oracle 9 times out of 10. And so this is great for us. And of course, as more businesses just digitize, this just draws more of our technology."

And I would say that as SAP moves their applications to S/4HANA in the cloud, and they do what I call hosting and they call cloud, the vast majority of those SAP databases do not run HANA. Way over -- 95% of them still run Oracle. It's a big business for us, even when it migrates to the cloud. I mean, Amazon has customers who have taken their Oracle database licenses, and they're running those Oracle database licenses in the cloud. So license does not mean on-premise, and license does not mean the cloud. It can -- it's a bit of a -- it's a mixed bag, right? Some of that license revenue and most of the new license revenue is on its way to the cloud."
