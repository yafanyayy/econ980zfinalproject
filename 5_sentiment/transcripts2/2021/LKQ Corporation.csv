This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2021 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks. 
A year ago on this call, we mentioned the coronavirus a couple of times, mostly related to supply chain considerations. With the year of heightened sight, I can safely say that we, like the rest of the world, vastly underestimated the impact that COVID-19 would have on our way of life. I want to express my condolences to all those who have suffered a personal loss to this unfortunate pandemic, and my sincere thanks throughout to all those on the front line, the doctors, nurses, first responders, teachers and all those putting themselves at risk to serve their communities. We simply cannot thank you enough. 
During the fourth quarter, we faced the second wave in the pandemic and related restrictions on mobility. Yet, we still produced very strong results which were materially ahead of our expectations when we chatted with you on our third quarter call. As we mentioned at the outset of 2020 and reiterated throughout the pandemic, we were focused on a few key initiatives, and I am proud to say our segment teams again embraced and executed on many of these initiatives, not only in the fourth quarter, but for all of 2020. 
And let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives as we've entered 2021. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. 
We have 3 market-leading businesses, and the benefit of this structure shined brightly during 2020. Each business made significant progress on its goals, and the diversity of markets and customers helped to balance out some of the ebbs and flows impacting any individual business. Alongside these operating initiatives, the continued build-out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization on a go-forward basis. We made tremendous progress, and I am pleased to announce that we will be releasing our inaugural corporate sustainability report in the second quarter of this year. 
While this will be our first formal report, we have been an environmental leader since the day we were founded in 1998, as a salvage dismantler and recycler of passenger vehicles. Today, we are the largest global recycler of vehicles having processed over 810,000 cars and trucks in 2020. While we are widely known for our recycling and environmental stewardship, we also have a long history of responsible and thoughtful social and governance practices, which we look forward to highlighting in the coming months. 
Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 4, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $3 billion, a decline of 1.9% from the comparable period of 2019. Parts and services organic revenue declined 5.2% in the quarter and 6.1% on a per day basis. Net income during the fourth quarter was $180 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.59, an increase of 28% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $212 million, an increase of 27% over 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 28% year-over-year. 
So let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends from October through January, and it's quite clear that we didn't witness any change to the upside, either in North America or in Europe. There was simply no meaningful catalyst to reverse the ongoing constraints on mobility. We are encouraged by the initial rollout of the vaccine in the U.S. in certain parts of Europe, but there still remains uncertainty about virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. 
As we begin to see the benefits of the vaccine come through and further relief from the stay at home mandates, we should see some positive movement in mobility. We are cautiously optimistic that we may see a slight recovery in demand towards the second half of this year. 
As you will note from Slide 6, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 13.7% in the quarter. While still down on a year-over-year basis, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims declined 27% in the fourth quarter. 
Based with year-over-year organic declines in parts and services revenue in each quarter of 2020, the North American team used its agility and decisiveness to protect the business by focusing on profitability, embracing various KPIs to drive efficiency and aggressively rightsizing the cost structure to be aligned with the revenue trends. These actions contribute to North America having its highest annual EBITDA margins in the history of the company. 
Moving to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter declined 3.1%. Demand trends softened sequentially in the fourth quarter as a second wave of lockdown provisions were enacted across all of our European regions, with larger impacts in November and December. 
Most of our regional operations experienced similar revenue declines in the quarter, except for Italy, which struggled. As we articulated at our Investor Day in September of last year, we continue to execute on our One LKQ Europe program. Of note, during 2020, we added significant talent to the European team including new operating leaders in Italy, the Benelux region and Central and Eastern Europe. We recruited a new CFO and added new positions of Controller, Head of HR, VP of Strategy and several other positions. 
Our shared services effort is progressing well with a new center located in Poland that should become operational in the second half of 2021, and we are also currently leveraging our Bangalore captive. Our pan-European ERP initial implementation was successfully completed at React Switzerland, and we expect to go live with IAG Italy in mid-2021. 
Our team is actively focused on driving permanent reductions in SG&A as available government support diminishes. Our vendor financing program is coming along really well, and our LKQ Europe head office in Zoox, Switzerland was occupied beginning of January 2021. 
Lastly, on Europe, this time last year, I mentioned that we began construction on our new Central Distribution Center, or CDC, for our Forest business in the Benelux region. Today, I am happy to report that the keys have just been turned over, and our team is starting the logistical and operational phases of the build-out. 
The logistical layout is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, after which LKQ 4s will enter the testing phase. At the end of this year, we will begin using the shuttle system in the new software. 
During 2022, we will begin to migrate the activities in the 4 existing distribution centers over to the new CDC. As part of LKQ sustainability agenda, the roof of this new building is fully equipped with solar panels, making the building completely energy self-sufficient. The building is also completely gas free and will provide sufficient charging infrastructure for plenty of electric vehicles. 
Additionally, the large number of windows in the building provides plenty of natural light, creating an attractive work environment for our team. Now let's move on to the Specialty segment. 
During Q4, Specialty reported organic revenue growth of 16.6%, performance well above our expectations and represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since the closing of our acquisition of Keystone Automotive operations back in 2014. A primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RV parts, a trend we anticipate will continue as the growth in new unit RV sales will result in a larger RV park, and that will inevitably need more replacement parts as those vehicles work through their life cycle. No one is better positioned to take advantage of that opportunity than LKQ. 
Also driving the performance was demand of our drop ship business and consistent with the industry, strong demand for our Warren products. From a corporate development perspective, in 2020, our team did a fantastic job of focusing their efforts on rationalizing our asset base and divesting noncore assets. In 2020, we completed 4 divestiture transactions, all of which related to European assets that came along with the 2018 Stagger acquisition. 
As you all know, vehicle technology continues to lead to more complex repairs and to be positioned at the forefront of this trend, we have made strategic acquisitions in the diagnostic space. Since acquiring Elite Electronics and BTEC automotive electronics in 2019, we have grown to become the largest U.S. provider of mobile on-site vehicle services to the automotive collision repairs, mechanical repairs and the national fleets. 
This past January, we combined the 2 mobile automotive services together under a single brand known as Elitech Vehicle Services. We remain confident that we will continue to increase our market share and brand awareness within this unique and rapidly growing market. Then yet, we are just scratching the surface on the opportunities ahead during these exciting times for passenger and commercial vehicle design. 
As the car park evolves, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our distribution network, to increase our product and service offerings, to capture the growth in hybrids and EVs. Our strategy and development teams continue to identify new markets and products to pursue, some of which we touched on during our Investor Day back in September. 
No one, in my opinion, is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than LKQ, as we have the people, the network, the scale and the capital to be successful. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results."

While there is a lot to share from our fourth quarter results, full year 2020 and outlook for 2021, I'll keep my prepared comments brief as there is a lot more detail in the accompanying earn",1475,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. While there is a lot to share from our fourth quarter results, full year 2020 and outlook for 2021, I'll keep my prepared comments brief as there is a lot more detail in the accompanying earnings presentation. 
While 2020 proved to be an extremely challenging year for a variety of reasons, LKQ's resilience shown through in tough times, as evidenced by the following highlights: one, record high annual earnings per share, including the 2 highest quarterly results in the company's history, those being the third and the fourth quarter; two, record high annual segment EBITDA margin for North America and for the company since 2015; three, record free cash flow at well over $1 billion, the first time we've exceeded $1 billion and now the third in a row record free cash flow year in the company's history; and finally, net leverage dropped to 1.9x, the first time it's been below 2x since 2015, which was well before the Rig, PGW, SthalGruber and several other acquisitions. 
To put these results in perspective, consider we beat the midpoint of our pre-COVID adjusted EPS and cash flow guidance despite falling well short of our organic revenue growth range of 0.5% to 2.5%. In dollar terms, that's over $1 billion shortfall on revenue relative to our original guidance at the midpoint. 
Our profitability and cash flow results are a testament to the ongoing margin and cash programs that we accelerated and actions we prioritized at the onset of the lockdown measures last March. 
Now we all know such outcomes don't happen by accident. And so a massive thank you to all my LKQ colleagues for their tireless efforts over the last year to deliver a truly outstanding outcome for our company. Customers, suppliers and several other stakeholders while persevering through the ongoing pandemic. 
I'll now cover the fourth quarter financial highlights and liquidity before sharing our thoughts on the outlook for 2021. As you can see on Slide 11, North America continued to deliver in the fourth quarter with segment EBITDA margin up 420 basis points over the prior year and 60 basis points sequentially. Permanent cost savings in overhead expenses was the primary driver of the improvement, and precious metal prices remained and gave us a healthy tailwind for the quarter with an estimated $18 million year-over-year benefit on gross margin. 
Moving over to Slide 12. Europe produced another solid quarter with an 8.6% segment EBITDA margin, up 100 basis points relative to a year ago, largely due to operating expense reductions. Importantly, Europe generated an 8.9% segment EBITDA margin for the second half, which is solidly above the 8% to 8.5% range provided at last September's Investor Day and represents good progress towards delivering on the One LKQ program, and these results include higher year-over-year transformation expenses. 
Despite the negative effects of the second wave of COVID, at this time, we remain comfortable with our 2021 projection of segment EBITDA margin of 9.2% to 10.3% for the segment. 
With Specialty on Slide 13, Nick highlighted the impressive 16.6% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was down 40 basis points, owing to unfavorable movements in vendor and customer rebates, though some of the fluctuation is timing, as we had positive true-ups from the fourth quarter activity a year ago and negative impact this year with the volume increase. 
Overhead expenses were favorable by 50 basis points and would have been more without a negative effect of about 80 basis points from incentive compensation adjustments. 
Now on to cash flow and liquidity. Q4 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. We added a further $309 million in operating cash flows, as we continued to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018. Benefits from receivables and payables offset the expected growth in inventory, although the inventory rebuild wasn't as high as previously anticipated due to supplier delivery challenges. 
As shown on Slide 14, operating cash flows were $1.4 billion for the year and CapEx cash outlays were $173 million. The resulting free cash flow and cash on hand was used to pay down almost $1.4 billion in debt for the year. 
We're very pleased with the trend in EBITDA to free cash flow conversion as presented on Slide 15. Though as I previously highlighted, the 2020 ratio of 98% just isn't sustainable as we flex inventory levels by over $400 million to align with demand forecasts. 
As growth returns, we plan to invest in inventory levels, though largely offset by the ongoing vendor financing program to ensure we maintain our best-in-class service levels and fill rates. 
On Slide 16, you can see the progress we've made this year to strengthen our liquidity position. I want to specifically highlight the net leverage ratio, which has decreased to 1.9x from 2.6x at the end of 2019 and is in line with our target net leverage of approximately 2x. We are very comfortable with our liquidity position, including the availability and cost of funds and believe we are very well positioned in our pursuit of investment-grade metrics. 
As mentioned last October, we restarted our share repurchase program after the third quarter earnings call. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $30 million of LKQ shares for a total investment of $117 million for the year. We had $531 million available on our authorization as of the year-end. So now I will close with our thoughts on 2021. 
As COVID uncertainties remain, we are not providing full financial guidance for the year at this time. We will revisit this position as the year progresses, and we have greater clarity on the vaccine rollout and its impact on the duration and severity of the pandemic. We are comfortable providing the following statements, all of which are based on the assumption that, one, extreme mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not reimplemented in our major markets; and two, scrap and precious metal prices, and foreign exchange rates continue near their recent levels. 
So a few points to highlight. First, we believe that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full year basis in 2021, though down in the first quarter relative to 2020. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will accelerate as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions fall off, though we do not expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue figure until some time in 2022. 
Please note that we have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, 1 fewer in Q1 and the second in Q4, while Europe is flat with 1 fewer day in Q1, though that catches up in the second quarter. 
The second point I'd like to highlight is, with revenue growth and the ongoing benefit of our margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be above the comparable figure for 2020. 
With that in mind, we are projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $2.65 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.75. On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.40 to $2.60. Given the momentum of our European business in the second half of 2020 exceeding the upper end of the range provided last September, we are reaffirming the outlook for the European 2021 segment EBITDA margin range of 9.2% to 10.3%. Four, we project the free cash flow for the full year 2021 will be a minimum of $800 million. While the absolute number is lower than the 2020 figure, we've been very clear throughout this past year that 2020 was a strange year for cash generation as a result of the pandemic. As we aligned inventory levels to forecasted demand, our stock levels declined by well over $400 million, which in turn produced a significant cash inflow. 
However, we are going to give some of the inflow back in 2021 as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated revenue growth. Some of the investment in inventory will be offset by improvements in days payables resulting from vendor financing program, which we expect to yield more significant benefits in 2021 and in line with the target we had set out in September of 2019, when we launched the One LKQ program. 
And finally, on capital expenditure, we plan to get back to our normal levels of 2% to 2.25% of revenue. All of these factors will produce a lower free cash flow amount than 2020, but importantly, will still put us within our target conversion range of 55% to 60% of free cash flow to EBITDA, widely considered to be best-in-class for industrial distribution companies. 
Thank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

In closing, if you asked me in late March 2020 after the onset of the pandemic to predict the financial results that we would achieve in 2020 and how do we end up the year, I would likely have not even come close to guessing at such a remarkable outcome. But the one thing I never questioned are the capabilities of my team. These results are a clear testament of the pride, dedication, resiliency and capabilities of the LKQ team members across the globe. 
One famous college football coach said ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. But it's attitude that determines how well you do it. Despite the challenges and the ones we faced, it is the positive, nothing will stop us attitude that our 44,000 dedicated team members bring to work each day, and that carried us through the headwinds of 2020. It simultaneously generated favorable outcomes that allowed us to reach certain key milestones. 
We rightsized the North American segment and generated record margins. We made solid progress on our One LKQ Europe program and generated higher second half margins than projected at our September 2020 Investor Day. The uniqueness of our diversified portfolio of businesses allowed us to benefit from the rise in demand for RV replacement parts. 
We effectively managed our working capital and generated almost $1.3 billion in free cash flow, an annual record for the company. And the excellent free cash flow allowed us to pay down a record $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our leverage ratio below 2x. We continued our talent acquisition initiatives by adding individuals to key roles across our broad and diversified portfolio of businesses. We made good progress on our global sustainability programs, and we continue to provide the best-in-class customer service in spite of the pandemic and importantly, all while focusing on the health and safety of our team. 
As I've said both internally and externally, we will come out of this pandemic period a stronger, better organization, further solidifying our market-leading positions. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

Here in the U.S., it's difficult to find delivery drivers. So I think you kind of get the message in terms of the inflationary pressures that are building up. 
And also with oil prices now moving up in the higher 50s, close to $60 a barrel in any case. I think we have navigated, as you know, not just this past quarter, but I'd say, starting 2018, when we put in place our margin programs and obviously kind of accelerated our OpEx programs in conjunction with the cash programs, our teams have navigated those inflationary pressures pretty darn well. We're proud of what they do, and we believe we have the ability to continue to drive a number of the permanent cost reductions that our North America business has taken the lead on. 
But I do know that our European team is also following up with. So long story short, yes, are there inflationary pressures? Absolutely. Are we well set up to undertake those inflationary pressures? Yes, up to a certain point. It really depends in terms of what kind of comes through the next, call it, several weeks, as such.

And again, the weather in East, particularly in the last couple of weeks, I'm actually sitting in Austin because I got iced in going back to Sunday. 
The reality is our business is very much driven by total miles driven. And as you saw in the chart we included in the earnings deck, kind of the revenue trends, not just for the fourth quarter, but also for January. And you can see that January kind of picked up where December left off or picked up toward December left off, right? 
So until there's a really meaningful movement in mobility, we think we're going to be kind of in this level of activity. Ultimately, we've gotten a number of questions in the past about what's going to drive an increase in mobility. And clearly, getting through the pandemic and people getting out of their homes and returning to their daily lives will be the biggest impact. We don't believe that everyone is going to work from home forever. We don't think everybody on this call is going to permanently be working from home. And while we've all become fairly efficient and productive in the working from home, there's clearly a lack of community that is hard on organizations. 
We may not get back to 100% of folks being back in the office, but we do think a number of folks will get back into the office. We think kids are going to get back into school. And when all that happens, we think the use of public transportation will remain depressed for a longer period of time just because of the safety issues related to the virus and the like. So as some of those workers begin to head into the office or back into their workplaces, those who took public transportation may opt to take private transportation, which means instead of hopping on a train or a bus, they're going to hop on a car. 
So we're cautiously optimistic that miles driven will move back north, and that will help our business. Clearly, with the ice storms and the like that have hit the last couple of weeks throughout the United States, that should ultimately create demand for our business. I will tell you here in Texas, based on the news stories of the pileups in Dallas and Austin and Houston, that's probably going to create a bigger opportunity from a salvage buying perspective and a parts perspective because a lot of those cars are distorted when they hit ice going 40 miles an hour. 
But again, we're cautiously optimistic that we will get back to more normal levels of miles driven, which will lead to a normal level of demand. It's going to take some time. We don't think it's going to just pop back in the second or third quarter. But hopefully, by 2022, we'll be back at historical levels of miles driven."

I mean there was a -- and has been, I think, as we note, a massive shift in discretionary spending away from things like restaurants and lodging and air travel, theaters, sporting events, all those group events, right.

I mean there was a -- and has been, I think, as we note, a massive shift in discretionary spending away from things like restaurants and lodging and air travel, theaters, sporting events, all those group events, right. And outdoor recreation and camping has absolutely been a huge beneficiary of that shift in discretionary spending. 
Our RV business historically has not been tied to the RV SAAR in any particular year that has been very highly correlated to campground spending. In 2020, the OEMs produced about 425,000 RV units, which was a great year. The expectation for 2021 is over 0.5 million units, will be all-time record high. The key there is that the size of a park, the number of RVs in the park is expanding. And that's great for the specialty business as all those incremental units that will be on the road for years and years to come will create demand for the parts that we sell. 
So even if the star ultimately settles down over the next 2 or 3 years, the units are still going to be on the road in that larger base is going to provide a great opportunity for us to sell specialty parts for many years to come. So the growth may ultimately slow down. We don't think we're going to continue to grow at 16% year-over-year, like we did in the fourth quarter. But we don't anticipate substantial declines in the overall revenue."

Obviously, one that's been kind of floating around the industry now for the better part of the year.

Obviously, one that's been kind of floating around the industry now for the better part of the year. The reality is, we believe that the supply chain and really, the manufacturers of the EV parts will ultimately look like -- look pretty much the same as the supply chain for internal combustion income. 
Now there's going to be a lot of overlap in suppliers, and we fully anticipate that some of the bigger vendors, like Bosch or Continental or Schefler, will absolutely develop hearts for electric vehicles. 
And while we're going to start with the OEMs as their focus, what they know today is that their current aftermarket business makes better profit margins than their OE parts business. And so it won't be long before they take that OE manufacturing capacity and start making parts for the aftermarket. We have very strong relationships with all those vendors. We've got the leading distribution capabilities as it relates to Europe, and it's a natural fit for us to do business together. 
Secondly, a lot of the conversion over the next 10 years or so, Bret, on electrification is going to come through hybrids. And hybrid, as you know, is a combination of an internal combustion engine and electric motor. And the opportunity for LKQ there is twofold. 
First, there's all sorts of new part types that we're going to be able to sell, things like AI coliforms and cool and fans, electric air conditioning compressors, electric driven motor inverter coolers, I mean, just a whole new set of products that we can ultimately distribute and then what we also know is that hybrid parts related to the internal combustion engine side of the powertrain are more expensive than similar parts on a non hybrid car. 
So like an AC compressor for a hydride vehicle, and we talked about this during our Investor Day back in December, can be 3x as expensive as an AT compressor for a normal just internal combustion engine car. A cooling pump can be 5 or 6x more expensive. So we think there's a good opportunity for us to distribute those parts as well and they're higher value parts. 
And then lastly, we think the big opportunity ultimately as it relates to EVs is the battery. Just like the engine is the most valuable part of a car that has an internal combustion engine, the battery is the most valuable part on a in batteries have fine life. They're not going to go out forever. The car is going to be around a lot longer than that initial battery. And so there will be opportunities, we believe, for us to remanufacture EV batteries because generally, it's not the whole battery that goes bad at once, but it's just a couple of cells. And it's going to be too expensive to replace the whole battery. So we think there's just a bundle of good opportunities for us in the future as it relates to the electrification of the car park."

Okay. Our business is just shy of the $50 million mark today, and it's growing. The great thing about of the services business it has better EBITDA margins than our North American parts business. And so that should help as that business continues to grow. 
Now we're not going to be able to grow that business by necessarily through acquisition to gain significant scale because like I said, most of these operators are in, they're tiny. So we will buy and look to buy perhaps some of the larger groups, even though that's still pretty small, and roll out on a greenfield basis by really educating technicians and then putting them out in the field as part of our Elite Tech Service offering.

And if you go back to that page, where we laid out the last 4 months, you can see that say for the specialty group, which just rocked during the fourth quarter. 
The revenue in both North America and Europe were down pretty consistently from the prior year levels. Obviously, Europe was doing better than North America because of our collision focus here. So it really wasn't revenue that led to the outperformance, Stephanie, it was our operating margins. 
We had good improvement on the gross margin line. And while on a consolidated basis it looks like gross margins came in a couple of basis points, that's just the mix shift because the North American business has margins north of 46%, the specialty business has margins around 28% and yet, the high-margin business kind of falling 13% in the low-margin, gross margin business roughly 16%. So you shouldn't take anything from that at all. 
The key is the operating leverage that we got out of the business. Each of our segments works hard to get the cost structure to reflect the current state of demand, and we're very proud of what our folks have done. Unfortunately, a lot of that has come on the backs of labor. We are down substantially from a total number of employees today versus where we were a year ago. But that's what -- just what it took to rightsize the business. And those are permanent reductions. We're going to be very cautious to add people and/or expense back to the SG&A line until we see the revenue rebound, and then we will need to add some people back to keep our customer service levels where they need to be. 
So think about the intense focus on controlling our cost because we're in an environment where we don't necessarily control our revenue."

I think it's a great question, Gary. Simply put, if you kind of go back to our Investor Day presentation from September, so probably about what, 5, 6 months ago, we were very clear in terms of we expected our free cash flow generation on a sustainable basis to kind of continue. We kind of reset the overall business model. So that kind of starting off is a great option to have as a business. 
We've always said that the key priority is investing in our own business. So capital expenditures will be kind of priority #1. Following that, we've said high synergy tuck-ins and building up critical capabilities. There was a question earlier on the call about scanning and diagnostics. That is a business that we are investing heavily into. Again, as Nick said, they're very small transactions. 6 to 12 technicians on a market-by-market basis. So certainly, wherever we have the ability, we're certainly acquiring those, but really also supplementing it with  the capital expenditures to kind of expand that specific service. We do not have any large platform transactions on the horizon. We do not see -- we need those at this point of time, which essentially leads us to a point where the excess free cash flow really would go towards either debt pay-down, although as you've seen, we've certainly made a tremendous amount of progress being at $1.4 billion in 2020, we are well within our target leverage at this point of time. So really, it becomes the highest return on capital opportunities, and we still believe that our shares are undervalued, and we certainly see no reason given the authorization we have from the Board to be able to repurchase our stock."

And ever since that, we've essentially been driving productivity through integration. And these programs, you really see in terms of how our North America business has taken the lead on that front. 
Just look at the fourth quarter operating expenses. In that business, yes, we certainly had challenges in terms of what the VMT has been, and so collision rates have come down. But as we think about how our collision business has performed relative to the data we're getting in from CCC, we are performing much better than what the repairable claims are out there. So that's kind of good. 
But really, it is the productivity piece of it that our North America leadership team has just an outstanding job. You then kind of move over to, say, for example, the next large component of our overall business, and that's in Europe. And Europe also has kind of begun to make some progress. We certainly saw some operating expenses come down in the fourth quarter. There's a lot more productivity to go get out there. And that really is the overall One LKQ program. We need to make investments out there, for example, in the European ERP program, setting up a back-office, for example. 
But really, the longer-term productivity really is from our European business, and that is something that we know our European team has a laser light focus in making sure that they certainly follow from within the portfolio of companies, as we share best practices between our businesses and our divisions, I know our North America leadership team has spent time with our European team also. 
It's one thing Nick and I kind of pushing and pulling certain levers. But as the peers speak with one another, largely, it's a very similar business. It's a distribution business, and that certainly has helped a lot also. 
But yes, you're right. Overall, productivity programs, every business of ours, every function of ours, as productivity programs to essentially offset the inflationary pressures that typically come around in any case. But it's the nimbleness and the agility that we are tremendously proud of, and that really came through in spades with the onset of the pandemic. I hope that responds to your question."

With regards to kind of ocean freight and the challenges associated with it, whether it be the number of carriers that are more outside of the port of L.A. Long Beach, for example, or for that matter, getting those empty cans back to Asia to kind of get refill and come over, we have long-term contracts with vessel providers, but also with certain brokers. So we are still being able to get space while we're having to pay up for it. 
We're still being able to get space for -- on those carriers. And then the other one, as you probably know, is LKQ has always had a class-leading inventory and fill rates. And so we've made sure that we always have the product. Yes, there are certain areas where we're having to run local or shuttles between -- within the region, for example. So we won't kind of ship something from, say, New England to California. But say, within the region, we are kind of making sure that our fill rates remain. So we do have the inventory. It may not always be in the right part. But we certainly learned a lot over the past few years in terms of making sure our fill rates remain. But at the same time, we are not kind of taking on excessive costs associated with it. 
Over time, we know that the Chinese New Year had kind of caused a certain splurge in terms of the amount of ocean freight that was coming over. We expect that to abate a little in the coming weeks and months. But clearly, that is a risk. But as I said previously, we have product, we have more product on the way. In any case, we think this will even itself out as we return to a growth mode starting Q2, which is largely kind of easy comps, but really getting back to growth in the second half of the year."

And listen, we want to kind of help everybody, specifically the carriers and our customers to making sure we get the right parts at the right time. 
So associated with kind of having the product. The second one clearly is making sure that we are that much more productive.

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2021 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks. 
A year ago on this call, we mentioned the coronavirus a couple of times, mostly related to supply chain considerations. With the year of heightened sight, I can safely say that we, like the rest of the world, vastly underestimated the impact that COVID-19 would have on our way of life. I want to express my condolences to all those who have suffered a personal loss to this unfortunate pandemic, and my sincere thanks throughout to all those on the front line, the doctors, nurses, first responders, teachers and all those putting themselves at risk to serve their communities. We simply cannot thank you enough. 
During the fourth quarter, we faced the second wave in the pandemic and related restrictions on mobility. Yet, we still produced very strong results which were materially ahead of our expectations when we chatted with you on our third quarter call. As we mentioned at the outset of 2020 and reiterated throughout the pandemic, we were focused on a few key initiatives, and I am proud to say our segment teams again embraced and executed on many of these initiatives, not only in the fourth quarter, but for all of 2020. 
And let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives as we've entered 2021. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. 
We have 3 market-leading businesses, and the benefit of this structure shined brightly during 2020. Each business made significant progress on its goals, and the diversity of markets and customers helped to balance out some of the ebbs and flows impacting any individual business. Alongside these operating initiatives, the continued build-out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization on a go-forward basis. We made tremendous progress, and I am pleased to announce that we will be releasing our inaugural corporate sustainability report in the second quarter of this year. 
While this will be our first formal report, we have been an environmental leader since the day we were founded in 1998, as a salvage dismantler and recycler of passenger vehicles. Today, we are the largest global recycler of vehicles having processed over 810,000 cars and trucks in 2020. While we are widely known for our recycling and environmental stewardship, we also have a long history of responsible and thoughtful social and governance practices, which we look forward to highlighting in the coming months. 
Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 4, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $3 billion, a decline of 1.9% from the comparable period of 2019. Parts and services organic revenue declined 5.2% in the quarter and 6.1% on a per day basis. Net income during the fourth quarter was $180 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.59, an increase of 28% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $212 million, an increase of 27% over 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 28% year-over-year. 
So let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends from October through January, and it's quite clear that we didn't witness any change to the upside, either in North America or in Europe. There was simply no meaningful catalyst to reverse the ongoing constraints on mobility. We are encouraged by the initial rollout of the vaccine in the U.S. in certain parts of Europe, but there still remains uncertainty about virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. 
As we begin to see the benefits of the vaccine come through and further relief from the stay at home mandates, we should see some positive movement in mobility. We are cautiously optimistic that we may see a slight recovery in demand towards the second half of this year. 
As you will note from Slide 6, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 13.7% in the quarter. While still down on a year-over-year basis, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims declined 27% in the fourth quarter. 
Based with year-over-year organic declines in parts and services revenue in each quarter of 2020, the North American team used its agility and decisiveness to protect the business by focusing on profitability, embracing various KPIs to drive efficiency and aggressively rightsizing the cost structure to be aligned with the revenue trends. These actions contribute to North America having its highest annual EBITDA margins in the history of the company. 
Moving to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter declined 3.1%. Demand trends softened sequentially in the fourth quarter as a second wave of lockdown provisions were enacted across all of our European regions, with larger impacts in November and December. 
Most of our regional operations experienced similar revenue declines in the quarter, except for Italy, which struggled. As we articulated at our Investor Day in September of last year, we continue to execute on our One LKQ Europe program. Of note, during 2020, we added significant talent to the European team including new operating leaders in Italy, the Benelux region and Central and Eastern Europe. We recruited a new CFO and added new positions of Controller, Head of HR, VP of Strategy and several other positions. 
Our shared services effort is progressing well with a new center located in Poland that should become operational in the second half of 2021, and we are also currently leveraging our Bangalore captive. Our pan-European ERP initial implementation was successfully completed at Rhiag Switzerland, and we expect to go live with Rhiag Italy in mid-2021. 
Our team is actively focused on driving permanent reductions in SG&A as available government support diminishes. Our vendor financing program is coming along really well, and our LKQ Europe head office in Zug, Switzerland was occupied beginning of January 2021. 
Lastly, on Europe, this time last year, I mentioned that we began construction on our new Central Distribution Center, or CDC, for our Fource business in the Benelux region. Today, I am happy to report that the keys have just been turned over, and our team is starting the logistical and operational phases of the build-out. 
The logistical layout is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, after which LKQ 4s will enter the testing phase. At the end of this year, we will begin using the shuttle system in the new software. 
During 2022, we will begin to migrate the activities in the 4 existing distribution centers over to the new CDC. As part of LKQ sustainability agenda, the roof of this new building is fully equipped with solar panels, making the building completely energy self-sufficient. The building is also completely gas free and will provide sufficient charging infrastructure for plenty of electric vehicles. 
Additionally, the large number of windows in the building provides plenty of natural light, creating an attractive work environment for our team. Now let's move on to the Specialty segment. 
During Q4, Specialty reported organic revenue growth of 16.6%, performance well above our expectations and represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since the closing of our acquisition of Keystone Automotive operations back in 2014. A primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RV parts, a trend we anticipate will continue as the growth in new unit RV sales will result in a larger RV park, and that will inevitably need more replacement parts as those vehicles work through their life cycle. No one is better positioned to take advantage of that opportunity than LKQ. 
Also driving the performance was demand of our drop ship business and consistent with the industry, strong demand for our Warn products. From a corporate development perspective, in 2020, our team did a fantastic job of focusing their efforts on rationalizing our asset base and divesting non-core assets. In 2020, we completed 4 divestiture transactions, all of which related to European assets that came along with the 2018 Stahlgruber acquisition. 
As you all know, vehicle technology continues to lead to more complex repairs and to be positioned at the forefront of this trend, we have made strategic acquisitions in the diagnostic space. Since acquiring Elite Electronics and VeTech automotive electronics in 2019, we have grown to become the largest U.S. provider of mobile on-site vehicle services to the automotive collision repairs, mechanical repairs and the national fleets. 
This past January, we combined the 2 mobile automotive services together under a single brand known as Elitek Vehicle Services. We remain confident that we will continue to increase our market share and brand awareness within this unique and rapidly growing market. Then yet, we are just scratching the surface on the opportunities ahead during these exciting times for passenger and commercial vehicle design. 
As the car park evolves, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our distribution network, to increase our product and service offerings, to capture the growth in hybrids and EVs. Our strategy and development teams continue to identify new markets and products to pursue, some of which we touched on during our Investor Day back in September. 
No one, in my opinion, is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than LKQ, as we have the people, the network, the scale and the capital to be successful. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results."

While there is a lot to share from our fourth quarter results, full year 2020 and outlook for 2021, I'll keep my prepared comments brief as there is a lot more detail in the accompanying earn",1475,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. While there is a lot to share from our fourth quarter results, full year 2020 and outlook for 2021, I'll keep my prepared comments brief as there is a lot more detail in the accompanying earnings presentation. 
While 2020 proved to be an extremely challenging year for a variety of reasons, LKQ's resilience shown through in tough times, as evidenced by the following highlights: one, record high annual earnings per share, including the 2 highest quarterly results in the company's history, those being the third and the fourth quarter; two, record high annual segment EBITDA margin for North America and for the company since 2015; three, record free cash flow at well over $1 billion, the first time we've exceeded $1 billion and now the third in a row record free cash flow year in the company's history; and finally, net leverage dropped to 1.9x, the first time it's been below 2x since 2015, which was well before the Rhiag, PGW, Stahlgruber and several other acquisitions. 
To put these results in perspective, consider we beat the midpoint of our pre-COVID adjusted EPS and cash flow guidance despite falling well short of our organic revenue growth range of 0.5% to 2.5%. In dollar terms, that's over $1 billion shortfall on revenue relative to our original guidance at the midpoint. 
Our profitability and cash flow results are a testament to the ongoing margin and cash programs that we accelerated and actions we prioritized at the onset of the lockdown measures last March. 
Now we all know such outcomes don't happen by accident. And so a massive thank you to all my LKQ colleagues for their tireless efforts over the last year to deliver a truly outstanding outcome for our company, customers, suppliers and several other stakeholders while persevering through the ongoing pandemic. 
I'll now cover the fourth quarter financial highlights and liquidity before sharing our thoughts on the outlook for 2021. As you can see on Slide 11, North America continued to deliver in the fourth quarter with segment EBITDA margin up 420 basis points over the prior year and 60 basis points sequentially. Permanent cost savings in overhead expenses was the primary driver of the improvement, and precious metal prices remained and gave us a healthy tailwind for the quarter with an estimated $18 million year-over-year benefit on gross margin. 
Moving over to Slide 12. Europe produced another solid quarter with an 8.6% segment EBITDA margin, up 100 basis points relative to a year ago, largely due to operating expense reductions. Importantly, Europe generated an 8.9% segment EBITDA margin for the second half, which is solidly above the 8% to 8.5% range provided at last September's Investor Day and represents good progress towards delivering on the One LKQ program, and these results include higher year-over-year transformation expenses. 
Despite the negative effects of the second wave of COVID, at this time, we remain comfortable with our 2021 projection of segment EBITDA margin of 9.2% to 10.3% for the segment. 
With Specialty on Slide 13, Nick highlighted the impressive 16.6% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was down 40 basis points, owing to unfavorable movements in vendor and customer rebates, though some of the fluctuation is timing, as we had positive true-ups from the fourth quarter activity a year ago and negative impact this year with the volume increase. 
Overhead expenses were favorable by 50 basis points and would have been more without a negative effect of about 80 basis points from incentive compensation adjustments. 
Now on to cash flow and liquidity. Q4 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. We added a further $309 million in operating cash flows, as we continued to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018. Benefits from receivables and payables offset the expected growth in inventory, although the inventory rebuild wasn't as high as previously anticipated due to supplier delivery challenges. 
As shown on Slide 14, operating cash flows were $1.4 billion for the year and CapEx cash outlays were $173 million. The resulting free cash flow and cash on hand was used to pay down almost $1.4 billion in debt for the year. 
We're very pleased with the trend in EBITDA to free cash flow conversion as presented on Slide 15. Though as I previously highlighted, the 2020 ratio of 98% just isn't sustainable as we flex inventory levels by over $400 million to align with demand forecasts. 
As growth returns, we plan to invest in inventory levels, though largely offset by the ongoing vendor financing program to ensure we maintain our best-in-class service levels and fill rates. 
On Slide 16, you can see the progress we've made this year to strengthen our liquidity position. I want to specifically highlight the net leverage ratio, which has decreased to 1.9x from 2.6x at the end of 2019 and is in line with our target net leverage of approximately 2x. We are very comfortable with our liquidity position, including the availability and cost of funds and believe we are very well positioned in our pursuit of investment-grade metrics. 
As mentioned last October, we restarted our share repurchase program after the third quarter earnings call. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $30 million of LKQ shares for a total investment of $117 million for the year. We had $531 million available on our authorization as of the year-end. So now I will close with our thoughts on 2021. 
As COVID uncertainties remain, we are not providing full financial guidance for the year at this time. We will revisit this position as the year progresses, and we have greater clarity on the vaccine rollout and its impact on the duration and severity of the pandemic. We are comfortable providing the following statements, all of which are based on the assumption that, one, extreme mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not reimplemented in our major markets; and two, scrap and precious metal prices, and foreign exchange rates continue near their recent levels. 
So a few points to highlight. First, we believe that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full year basis in 2021, though down in the first quarter relative to 2020. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will accelerate as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions fall off, though we do not expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue figure until some time in 2022. 
Please note that we have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, one fewer in Q1 and the second in Q4, while Europe is flat with one fewer day in Q1, though that catches up in the second quarter. 
The second point I'd like to highlight is, with revenue growth and the ongoing benefit of our margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be above the comparable figure for 2020. 
With that in mind, we are projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $2.65 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.75. On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.40 to $2.60. Given the momentum of our European business in the second half of 2020 exceeding the upper end of the range provided last September, we are reaffirming the outlook for the European 2021 segment EBITDA margin range of 9.2% to 10.3%. Four, we project the free cash flow for the full year 2021 will be a minimum of $800 million. While the absolute number is lower than the 2020 figure, we've been very clear throughout this past year that 2020 was a strange year for cash generation as a result of the pandemic. As we aligned inventory levels to forecasted demand, our stock levels declined by well over $400 million, which in turn produced a significant cash inflow. 
However, we are going to give some of the inflow back in 2021 as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated revenue growth. Some of the investment in inventory will be offset by improvements in days payables resulting from vendor financing program, which we expect to yield more significant benefits in 2021 and in line with the target we had set out in September of 2019, when we launched the 1 LKQ program. 
And finally, on capital expenditure, we plan to get back to our normal levels of 2% to 2.25% of revenue. All of these factors will produce a lower free cash flow amount than 2020, but importantly, will still put us within our target conversion range of 55% to 60% of free cash flow to EBITDA, widely considered to be best-in-class for industrial distribution companies. 
Thank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

In closing, if you asked me in late March 2020 after the onset of the pandemic to predict the financial results that we would achieve in 2020 and how do we end up the year, I would likely have not even come close to guessing at such a remarkable outcome. But the one thing I never questioned are the capabilities of my team. These results are a clear testament of the pride, dedication, resiliency and capabilities of the LKQ team members across the globe. 
One famous college football coach said ""ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. But it's attitude that determines how well you do it."" Despite the challenges and the ones we faced, it is the positive, nothing will stop us attitude that our 44,000 dedicated team members bring to work each day, and that carried us through the headwinds of 2020. It simultaneously generated favorable outcomes that allowed us to reach certain key milestones. 
We rightsized the North American segment and generated record margins. We made solid progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program and generated higher second half margins than projected at our September 2020 Investor Day. The uniqueness of our diversified portfolio of businesses allowed us to benefit from the rise in demand for RV replacement parts. 
We effectively managed our working capital and generated almost $1.3 billion in free cash flow, an annual record for the company. And the excellent free cash flow allowed us to pay down a record $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our leverage ratio below 2x. We continued our talent acquisition initiatives by adding individuals to key roles across our broad and diversified portfolio of businesses. We made good progress on our global sustainability programs, and we continue to provide the best-in-class customer service in spite of the pandemic and importantly, all while focusing on the health and safety of our team. 
As I've said both internally and externally, we will come out of this pandemic period a stronger, better organization, further solidifying our market-leading positions. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

Here in the U.S., it's difficult to find delivery drivers. So I think you kind of get the message in terms of the inflationary pressures that are building up. 
And also with oil prices now moving up in the higher $50s, close to $60 a barrel in any case. I think we have navigated, as you know, not just this past quarter, but I'd say, starting 2018, when we put in place our margin programs and obviously kind of accelerated our OpEx programs in conjunction with the cash programs, our teams have navigated those inflationary pressures pretty darn well. We're proud of what they do, and we believe we have the ability to continue to drive a number of the pandemic cost reductions that our North America business has taken the lead on, but I do know that our European team is also following up with. 
So long story short, yes, are there inflationary pressures? Absolutely. Are we well set up to undertake those inflationary pressures? Yes, up to a certain point. It really depends in terms of what kind of comes through the next, call it, several weeks, as such.

The reality is our business is very much driven by total miles driven. And as you",488,"Great question, Scott. And again, the weather in East, particularly in the last couple of weeks, I'm actually sitting in Austin because I got iced in going back to Sunday. 
The reality is our business is very much driven by total miles driven. And as you saw in the chart we included in the earnings deck, kind of the revenue trends, not just for the fourth quarter, but also for January. And you can see that January kind of picked up where December left off or picked up where December left off, right? 
So until there's a really meaningful movement in mobility, we think we're going to be kind of in this level of activity. Ultimately, we've gotten a number of questions in the past about what's going to drive an increase in mobility. And clearly, getting through the pandemic and people getting out of their homes and returning to their daily lives will be the biggest impact. We don't believe that everyone is going to work from home forever. We don't think everybody on this call is going to permanently be working from home. And while we've all become fairly efficient and productive in the working from home, there's clearly a lack of community that is hard on organizations. 
We may not get back to 100% of folks being back in the office, but we do think a number of folks will get back into the office. We think kids are going to get back into school. And when all that happens, we think the use of public transportation will remain depressed for a longer period of time just because of the safety issues related to the virus and the like. So as some of those workers begin to head into the office or back into their workplaces, those who took public transportation may opt to take private transportation, which means instead of hopping on a train or a bus, they're going to hop in a car. 
So we're cautiously optimistic that miles driven will move back North, and that will help our business. Clearly, with the ice storms and the like that have hit the last couple of weeks throughout the United States, that should ultimately create demand for our business. I will tell you here in Texas, based on the news stories of the pileups in Dallas and Austin and Houston, that's probably going to create a bigger opportunity from a salvage buying perspective and a parts perspective because a lot of those cars are distorted when they hit ice going 40 miles an hour. 
But again, we're cautiously optimistic that we will get back to more normal levels of miles driven, which will lead to a normal level of demand. It's going to take some time. We don't think it's going to just pop back in the second or third quarter. But hopefully, by 2022, we'll be back at historical levels of miles driven."

I mean there was a -- and has been, I think, as we note, a massive shift in discretionary spending away from things like restaurants and lodging and air travel, theaters, sporting events, all those group events, right. And outdoor recreation and camping has absolutely been a huge beneficiary of that shift in discretionary spending. 
Our RV business historically has not been tied to the RV SAAR in any particular year that has been very highly correlated to campground spending. In 2020, the OEMs produced about 425,000 RV units, which was a great year. The expectation for 2021 is over 0.5 million units, will be all-time record high. The key there is that the size of a park, the number of RVs in the park is expanding. And that's great for the specialty business as all those incremental units that will be on the road for years and years to come will create demand for the parts that we sell. 
So even if the SAAR ultimately settles down over the next 2 or 3 years, the units are still going to be on the road in that larger base is going to provide a great opportunity for us to sell specialty parts for many years to come. So the growth may ultimately slow down. We don't think we're going to continue to grow at 16% year-over-year, like we did in the fourth quarter. But we don't anticipate substantial declines in the overall revenue."

Obviously, one that's been kind of floating around the industry now for the better part of the year.

Obviously, one that's been kind of floating around the industry now for the better part of the year. The reality is, we believe that the supply chain and really, the manufacturers of the EV parts will ultimately look like -- look pretty much the same as the supply chain for internal combustion inventory.
Now there's going to be a lot of overlap in suppliers, and we fully anticipate that some of the bigger vendors, like Bosch or Continental or Schefler, will absolutely develop parts for electric vehicles. 
And while we're going to start with the OEMs as their focus, what they know today is that their current aftermarket business makes better profit margins than their OE parts business. And so it won't be long before they take that OE manufacturing capacity and start making parts for the aftermarket. We have very strong relationships with all those vendors. We've got the leading distribution capabilities as it relates to Europe, and it's a natural fit for us to do business together. 
Secondly, a lot of the conversion over the next 10 years or so, Bret, on electrification is going to come through hybrids. And hybrid, as you know, is a combination of an internal combustion engine and electric motor. And the opportunity for LKQ there is twofold. 
First, there's all sorts of new part types that we're going to be able to sell, things like battery coolant films and coolant fans, electric air conditioning compressors, electric driven motor inverter coolers, I mean, just a whole new set of products that we can ultimately distribute and then what we also know is that hybrid parts related to the internal combustion engine side of the powertrain are more expensive than similar parts on a non hybrid car. 
So like an AC compressor for a hydride vehicle -- and we talked about this during our Investor Day back in December, can be 3x as expensive as an AC compressor for a normal just internal combustion engine car. A coolant pump can be 5x or 6x more expensive. So we think there's a good opportunity for us to distribute those parts as well and they're higher value parts. 
And then lastly, we think the big opportunity ultimately as it relates to EVs is the battery. Just like the engine is the most valuable part of a car that has an internal combustion engine, the battery is the most valuable part on a EV. Batteries have fine life. They're not going to go out forever. The car is going to be around a lot longer than that initial battery. And so there will be opportunities, we believe, for us to remanufacture EV batteries because generally, it's not the whole battery that goes bad at once, but it's just a couple of cells. And it's going to be too expensive to replace the whole battery. So we think there's just a bundle of good opportunities for us in the future as it relates to the electrification of the car part."

Okay. Our business is just shy of the $50 million mark today, and it's growing. The great thing about the services business it has better EBITDA margins than our North American parts business. And so that should help as that business continues to grow. 
Now we're not going to be able to grow that business by necessarily through acquisition to gain significant scale because like I said, most of these operators are tiny. So we will buy and look to buy perhaps some of the larger groups, even though that's still pretty small, and roll out on a greenfield basis by really educating technicians and then putting them out in the field as part of our Elitek Service offering.

And if you go back to that page, where we laid out the last 4 months, you can see that say for the specialty group, which just rocked during the fourth quarter. 
The revenue in both North America and Europe were down pretty consistently from the prior year levels. Obviously, Europe was doing better than North America because of our collision focus here. So it really wasn't revenue that led to the out-performance, Stephanie, it was our operating margins. 
We had good improvement on the gross margin line. And while on a consolidated basis it looks like gross margins came in a couple of basis points, that's just the mix shift because the North American business has margins north of 46%, the specialty business has margins around 28% and yet, the high-margin business kind of falling 13% in the low-margin, gross margin business roughly 16%. So you shouldn't take anything from that at all. 
The key is the operating leverage that we got out of the business. Each of our segments works hard to get the cost structure to reflect the current state of demand, and we're very proud of what our folks have done. Unfortunately, a lot of that has come on the backs of labor. We are down substantially from a total number of employees today versus where we were a year ago. But that's what -- just what it took to rightsize the business. And those are permanent reductions. We're going to be very cautious to add people and/or expense back to the SG&A line until we see the revenue rebound, and then we will need to add some people back to keep our customer service levels where they need to be. 
So think about the intense focus on controlling our cost because we're in an environment where we don't necessarily control our revenue."

I think it's a great question, Gary. Simply put, if you kind of go back to our Investor Day presentation from September, so probably about what, 5, 6 months ago, we were very clear in terms of we expected our free cash flow generation on a sustainable basis to kind of continue. We kind of reset the overall business model. So that kind of starting off is a great option to have as a business. 
We've always said that the key priority is investing in our own business. So capital expenditures will be kind of priority #1. Following that, we've said high synergy tuck-ins and building up critical capabilities. There was a question earlier on the call about scanning and diagnostics. That is a business that we are investing heavily into. Again, as Nick said, they're very small transactions. 6 to 12 technicians on a market-by-market basis. So certainly, wherever we have the ability, we're certainly acquiring those, but really also supplementing it with  the capital expenditures to kind of expand that specific service. 
We do not have any large platform transactions on the horizon. We do not see that we need those at this point of time, which essentially leads us to a point where the excess free cash flow really would go towards either debt pay-down, although as you've seen, we've certainly made a tremendous amount of progress being at $1.4 billion in 2020, we are well within our target leverage at this point of time. So really, it becomes the highest return on capital opportunities, and we still believe that our shares are undervalued, and we certainly see no reason given the authorization we have from the Board to be able to repurchase our stock."

And ever since that, we've essentially been driving productivity through integration. And these programs, you really see in terms of how our North America business has taken the lead on that front. 
Just look at the fourth quarter operating expenses. In that business, yes, we certainly had challenges in terms of what the VMT has been, and so collision rates have come down. But as we think about how our collision business has performed relative to the data we're getting in from CCC, we are performing much better than what the repairable claims are out there. So that's kind of good. 
But really, it is the productivity piece of it that our North America leadership team has just an outstanding job. You then kind of move over to, say, for example, the next large component of our overall business, and that's in Europe. And Europe also has kind of begun to make some progress. We certainly saw some operating expenses come down in the fourth quarter. There's a lot more productivity to go get out there. And that really is the overall 1 LKQ program. We need to make investments out there, for example, in the European ERP program, setting up a back-office, for example. 
But really, the longer-term productivity really is from our European business, and that is something that we know our European team has a laser-like focus in making sure that they certainly follow from within the portfolio of companies, as we share best practices between our businesses and our divisions, I know our North America leadership team has spent time with our European team also. 
It's one thing Nick and I kind of pushing and pulling certain levers. But as the peers speak with one another, largely, it's a very similar business. It's a distribution business, and that certainly has helped a lot also. 
But yes, you're right. Overall, productivity programs, every business of ours, every function of ours, as productivity programs to essentially offset the inflationary pressures that typically come around in any case. But it's the nimbleness and the agility that we are tremendously proud of, and that really came through in spades with the onset of the pandemic. I hope that responds to your question."

With regards to kind of ocean freight and the challenges associated with it, whether it be the number of carriers that are more outside of the port of L.A. Long Beach, for example, or for that matter, getting those empty cans back to Asia to kind of get refilled and come over, we have long-term contracts with vessel providers, but also with certain brokers. So we are still being able to get space while we're having to pay up for it. We're still being able to get space for -- on those carriers. 
And then the other one, as you probably know, is LKQ has always had a class-leading inventory and fill rates. And so we've made sure that we always have the product. Yes, there are certain areas where we're having to run local or shuttles between -- within the region, for example. So we won't kind of ship something from, say, New England to California. But say, within the region, we are kind of making sure that our fill rates remain. So we do have the inventory. It may not always be in the right part. But we certainly learned a lot over the past few years in terms of making sure our fill rates remain. But at the same time, we are not kind of taking on excessive costs associated with it. 
Over time, we know that the Chinese New Year had kind of caused a certain splurge in terms of the amount of ocean freight that was coming over. We expect that to abate a little in the coming weeks and months. But clearly, that is a risk. But as I said previously, we have product, we have more product on the way. In any case, we think this will even itself out as we return to a growth mode starting Q2, which is largely kind of easy comps, but really getting back to growth in the second half of the year."

The cost that we've been able to take out initially what was temporarily in the second quarter and kind of then switching that into pendent cost reductions, that is certainly working out well for the entire enterprise. But obviously, we can't wait for kind of growth to return. It certainly helps us get more of our folks back in the field. But as of now, we're happy with the way our teams are navigating the various puts and takes that are out there."

Wow we've come a long way over the past 12 months. A year ago at this time, the threat of the pandemic had become a tremendous and painful reality. Immediately, our teams got into action with a key focus across the entire organization to rightsize the cost structure and maximize cash flow. In order to adjust to this new paradigm, Our teams had to make some very difficult decisions to protect the long-term health of our company. And in the past 3 quarters have proven that our ability to reset the cost structure of LKQ. Our global leadership team firmly believed we would come out of the pandemic period stronger and a better organization, and our performance this past quarter absolutely confirms that belief. 
Let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which, in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And finally, we will continue to invest in our future. 
As you can see from our results, our segment teams executed on each of these initiatives in the first quarter. Alongside these operating initiatives, The continued build-out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization. As promised during our last earnings call on April 6, we released our inaugural corporate sustainability report. This report validates our long-term commitment to enhancing our ESG practices and will serve as a guidepost for the further embedding of ESG principles throughout our global operations. 
Slide 16 of today's earnings deck provides a brief 1-page overview of the CSR report. If you have not already done so, I would highly encourage you to visit our website and download a copy of the full CSR. 
Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was $3.17 billion, an increase of 5.7% as compared to $3 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Parts and services organic revenue in the first quarter of 2021 increased 0.6% of 1% on a reported basis and 2.2% on a per day basis. While the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 0.6% and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 4.2%. Total parts and services revenue increased 4.2% in the quarter. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the initial pandemic impact last March. 
Through February, organic parts and services revenue was 4.4% lower on a per day basis. In March, organic parts and services revenue grew by 15.7% on a per day basis, recognizing we were coming off a lower comparable period. 
Other revenue grew 27% in the first quarter of 2021 driven by higher scrap steel and precious metal prices. While consolidated revenue is still running below pre-COVID levels, net income for the first quarter was $266 million as compared to $146 million last year, an increase of 83% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 was $0.88, an increase of 83%. 
On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter was $286 million, a 62% increase year-over-year while adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.94, a 65% increase. Each of our segments achieved EBITDA margins well ahead of our expectations due to excellent execution, a continued focus on our cost structure and with respect to North America, tailwinds from scrap and precious metals pricing. 
When taken collectively, these strong performances allowed LKQ to record, record consolidated segment EBITDA margins of 14.2% in the first quarter. This was a 350 basis point increase relative to the first quarter of last year. 
Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter, And as you can see, all segments were positive in March on a per-day basis. Obviously, during the tail end of February and the entire month of March, we were working from an easier comp But we also benefited as mobility began to gain ground in certain markets. 
Additionally, the penetration rate of the vaccine in the United States is encouraging, and as these trends gain ground in other key markets, we should begin to see a loosening of the stay-at-home mandates, and we would expect a gradual improvement in vehicle miles traveled, or VMT. 
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, at the end of the 2 of April, fuel consumption was 71% above the prior year and just 3% below that same week of 2019. 
According to the Apple Mobility Index, the trend in driving trips in our European markets was down early in the year relative to the third and fourth quarter levels of 2020, but as we progress through Q1, the index rebounded and by the third week of April, the index had increased 33% from the first week of January. So there are clearly some green shoots of momentum in VMT around the globe, albeit we're still below pre-COVID levels. 
Turning to North America. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 8.4% in the quarter on a reported basis and 7.0% per day basis. While still down on a year-over-year basis, it is an improvement relative to Q4 of last year. 
We continue to outpace the market in North America especially when you consider that industry data suggests that collision and liability-related repairable auto claims declined approximately 14% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior period. 
Relative to the competitive landscape, we are confident that we are gaining market share from small salvage and aftermarket operators that are typically capital-constrained and facing lower inventory levels due to product availability and cost inflation. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to continue to invest in our North American business, including inventory replenishment and also in various technologies and programs to further enhance the efficiency of our operations and the service experience for our customers. With capital constraints, many smaller competitors lack the flexibility to stay relevant and competitive. 
During the first quarter, our North American operations benefited from the disruption to the OE component supply chain, which impacted the OE's ability to build major mechanical inventory. This lack of major mechanical inventory for the OEs, combined with our robust levels of recycled and remanufactured engines and transmission products, provided the opportunity for our North American business to gain share in the quarter. Our salvage operations have been extremely judicious in their procurement efforts and selling more parts from the vehicles we procure enabling us to have stronger fulfillment rates than the industry average. 
In North America, during the first quarter, we continued our environmental stewardship efforts by processing 190,000 vehicles resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 900,000 gallons of fuel; 491,000 gallons of waste oil; 482,000 tires; and 176,000 batteries. During the first quarter, we also processed approximately 282,000 tons of scrap steel. 
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the first quarter increased 30 basis points as the largest pure-play distributor of aftermarket automotive parts in Europe. This is a solid start to 2021, even in the face of continuing COVID lockdowns in several regions of Europe. Our regional operations experienced varying revenue performance in the quarter, with positive year-over-year performance in Germany, Benelux and Eastern Europe with some softness in the U.K. and Italy continuing to drag on the overall performance of this segment. 
Specific to the U.K. In addition to our 2-step distribution business of mechanical service parts, we operate a few other businesses, including our collision parts in coatings businesses, which registered materially lower growth than our 2 stop mechanical parts distribution business in the first quarter. 
Importantly, with our corporate-wide focus on profitable revenue, we spent the past year rationalizing the footprint of our U.K. business, which eliminated over 40 unprofitable branches, resulting in a small negative impact on revenue, but a significant improvement in EBITDA margins. 
Revenue growth from our ongoing mechanical service parts operations was positive in the quarter, while our data indicates the overall U.K. market was down on a year-over-year basis. 
In total, we are delighted with the performance of our U.K. operations. Other items of note in Europe include; the fact that we continue to add talent and expect the organizational design elements of the 1 LKQ Europe program will be largely completed by the end of Q2; the fourth central distribution center project remains right on track; our ERP implementation at Rig Italy, we also remains on track for a Q2 go-live which will make it the first large platform company on our new European ERP system; and we continue to expand our payables optimization initiatives, which includes the vendor financing program. 
Lastly, on Europe, and consistent with our ESG programs, we recently launched an electric delivery vehicle trial for our U.K. and Republic of Ireland operations. The pilot will run for about 6 months and will take into account the charging point infrastructure to identify branches with vans whose typical mileage is suited to the range and capability of an electric vehicle. LKQ is also considering pilot projects with fuel cell-powered heavy trucks once those vehicles and filling stations become available. 
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. which absolutely knocked the cover off the ball during the first quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.9%. This represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since we bought this business in 2014, with Q4 of last year being the second highest quarter. The primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RVs and RV parts. 
The RV Industry Association's February 2021 survey of manufacturers determined that total RV shipments increased 30%, making it the best February RV unit ship in total on record. This is good on LKQ on a longer-term basis as a larger RV park should lead to more RV parts sales in the future. 
Also driving the specialty performance was the demand for light truck parts we offer, which, during the first quarter, increased 17% year-over-year, with strong demand for products installed on jeeps and pickup trucks. We believe that the third round of stimulus checks benefited our specialty business in the quarter. 
Across all of our segments, and like many others in vehicle park distribution, we are witnessing some supply chain disruptions, which have led to incremental cost in freight, labor and cost of goods sold. 
Related to ocean freight that container capacity constraints that we first experienced last fall continues to be a challenge. Our supply chain teams across the globe are in constant communication with our suppliers working to procure the products we need to maintain and grow our market share in each of our segments. 
Importantly, we have witnessed minimal impact to our fulfillment and customer service levels and believe the inventory challenges are subsiding. 
As it relates to inflationary risk, we remain cautious near term but as we progress through the year, we are expecting a continuing pandemic recovery, which would benefit each of our operating segments. Again, we expect to see continued inflation related to freight, labor and cost of goods sold. That said, as witnessed throughout 2020 and in the first quarter of this year, We Have a number of levers that we can pull to help offset these inflationary risks, including price. 
From a corporate development perspective, in the first quarter, we acquired a diagnostics business that provides various mobile diagnostic and programming services to professional collision and mechanical repair shops in Nebraska. By year-end, this business will be fully integrated into our Elite Tech vehicle services brand. We have a couple of other diagnostic transactions in the pipeline. 
Finally, I've previously noted several senior-level additions to the European team in the quarter, which will lead our efforts in the areas of strategy, sales, logistics and supply chain, product pricing and e-commerce. LKQ Europe is viewed by candidates as being a unique and extremely well-positioned enterprise with an exciting future. And we've been able to attract great talent from across the European automotive industry and digital channels. 
At the corporate level, during the first quarter, we brought on a new Senior Vice President of Human Resources to the Executive team. Geneve brings a wealth of experience in managing a large hourly based workforce and she has on-point experience in building programs focused on employee engagement and diversity and inclusion, key elements of our ESG initiatives. 
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong first quarter financial performance."

We entered 2021 with strong momentum coming off the 2 highest quarterly results in the company's history, the third and fourth quarter of 2020. This morning, I'm pleased to report that we were able to build on that momentum in the first quarter and take advantage of some tailwinds to produce yet another record quarter. 
As we've said repeatedly over the last year, we can't control when revenue growth will return to pre-COVID levels. However, we are able to manage our costs and have focused on rightsizing the cost structure and emphasizing efficiencies so that we can generate operating leverage when revenue growth returns. The permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020 continue to drive year-over-year profitability growth. And encouragingly, we got an additional boost in the first quarter as we were able to support the sequential revenue growth across all our segments without adding back costs at the same rate. 
Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue [indiscernible] this operating leverage dropping to 26.8% in the quarter or 320 basis points better than Q1 of 2020. We were also able to improve our gross margin by being disciplined [indiscernible] to ensure that our strong inventory availability and service levels were recognized in the industry. We believe that these operational strengths are sustainable going forward and will drive our results as the recovery picks up pace as expected in the second half of the year. We saw this transpire in the month of March as rebounding economic activity generated healthy revenue growth and cost controls limited the amount of incremental expenses, which resulted in the highest monthly profitability in the company's history. 
I mentioned the benefit of tailwinds in the quarter and commodity prices were most certainly significant. As you can see on Slide 20, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits in the quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $34 million in segment EBITDA, which would translate into about $0.08 in adjusted diluted EPS relative to the prior year. We expect that commodities will be in net benefit in the short term although likely at a lower level than Q1 as car costs continue to rise owing to the commodity price changes and further moderate in the second half of the year. 
Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to pure operating performance. 
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 19.9%. Q1 is the third consecutive quarter that we've been able to make the statement and is truly a testament to the resilience of the business and the management team's swift and decisive actions during the early days of the pandemic. The segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and the specific permanent cost reductions executed in 2020. 
Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits I mentioned are seen here, helping to drive the North America margins above our long-term expectation. 
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 9.6% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 390 basis point improvement over last year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the margin goal communicated last September at our Investor Day and reaffirmed in February following fourth quarter earnings. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery and cost containment actions taken last year with more anticipated on both fronts. 
Moving to Slide 12. As Nick described, the specialty results are truly outstanding. We are super excited about the spectacular revenue growth, and we're really pleased with the way the segment team has delivered the growth without adding back significant operating costs or sacrificing gross margin. The segment EBITDA margin of 13.4% is the highest Q1 result in the segment's history by approximately 150 basis points and reflects the leverage benefit achieved in a period of rapid growth and the discipline to pursue profitable revenue growth. 
We talked last year about the shift to an emphasis on operational excellence, and our first quarter results provide further evidence of this mindset taking hold. Each segment's disciplined execution of our strategic priorities has been excellent. 
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure, deploying free cash flow to debt pay downs and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these 2 factors added $0.02 per share to our Q1 '21 results. 
Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income generated another $0.03 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 28% to 26.5%. The reduced rate relative to 30% rate used in [indiscernible] of last year contributed approximately $0.025 of the year-over-year EPS growth. 
So to recap, Our adjusted EPS of $0.94 is a $0.37 increase over Q1 of 2020. The commodity benefit, along with the increases attributable to investments The tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced approximately $0.16 of that improvement. The remaining $0.21 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth, enhancing gross margins and controlling our overheads, and that should be the key takeaway when considering our Q1 profitability. 
Now on to cash flow and liquidity. Q1 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. As shown on Slide 13, we delivered $523 million in operating cash flows as we continue to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018 as benefits from payables more than offset the seasonal growth in receivables. We expected inventory to be a larger outflow in Q1, the ongoing supplier delivery challenges exacerbated by ocean freight challenges have pushed the build to later in the year. 
Despite the lower-than-anticipated inventory level, our teams with the support of our vendor partners skillfully ensure that the right parts are in the right places and thereby, minimize stock-out issues so that our class-leading fill rate were maintained. 
CapEx cash outlays were $42 million, resulting in free cash flow of $481 million. We used this cash to repay $83 million in debt and repurchased $57 million in LKQ stock. 
We also built our cash balance mostly in Europe in advance of the early redemption on April 1, which will the earliest possible redemption date of our [ EUR 750 million ] euro notes in 2026. We used the portion of the cash on hand to fund the redemption and grew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility. The redemption replaces the Eurobond with a coupon of [ 3.58 ] with credit facility borrowings approximately 250 basis points of lower cost. Do note that we had already anticipated the redemption and the resulting interest savings in our original earnings outlook provided in February. 
On Slide 15, you can see the further progress we have made to strengthen our liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio has decreased to 1.4x from 1.9 at the end of 2020 and going to our strong profitability and cash flows in the first quarter. We believe that we are very well positioned in our stated pursuit of an investment-grade profile. 
We are also pleased with the positive developments on this objective with both S&P and Moody's upgrading our credit rating in the first quarter. 
I will close with our updated thoughts on 2021. With the ongoing COVID uncertainties, especially concerning revenue trends, we are providing an abbreviated outlook. We are comfortable making the following statements, all of which presume that, one, additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not reimplemented or exacerbated in our major markets. Two, foreign exchange rates called near recent levels, and finally, three, scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year. 
With that, on revenue, we reaffirm our belief that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full year basis in 2021 versus 2020 with the most significant growth coming in the second quarter albeit off a low base. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will continue in the second half of the year as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions decreased. But we do not currently expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue until 2022. 
As discussed previously, we'll have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one already completed in Q1 and the second one in the fourth quarter, while Europe is flat with 1 fewer selling day in the first quarter but made up in the second quarter with the additional day. 
The other piece I want to talk about was earnings per share and with our strong first quarter performance, projected revenue growth and the ongoing benefit of our margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be significantly above the comparable figure for 2020. We are projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $3 to $3.20 with a midpoint of $3.10. 
On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.68 to $2.88. The $0.35 or 13% increase at the midpoint reflects the Q1 outperformance and upside in the projected results for the last 9 months compared to our prior outlook. We expect to achieve this upside while covering the effects of inflationary pressures being faced across the industry related to labor costs, ocean and domestic freight expenses and higher input costs, raising inventory prices. 
And finally, on cash flow, we are indeed off to a terrific start cash flow generation in Q1, which gives us the confidence to raise our minimum free cash flow expectation. We now project that free cash flow for the full year 2021 will be within the range of $850 million to $950 million with a midpoint of $900 million. We expect inventory purchases to represent an outflow over the remainder of the year as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated growth. Essentially, it is just going to happen later in the year than we had previously anticipated. Some of the investment in inventory will be offset by continued improvements in days payables resulting from the European payables optimization program which is producing benefits and tracking well in line with the target we have set out in September of 2019 when we initially launched the 1 LKQ Europe program. 
So with that, thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

So we've been very disciplined in our pricing. We have seen some creep in the cost of goods sold just because of the inflationary pressures at some of our suppliers. And we're doing our best to recover that and maintain gross margins. And we're comfortable with our approach. We have not seen significant pushback from our customers. The reality is we're not alone.

So last part of 2020, if was down about 15%, really from -- in through Thanksgiving into the end of the year. And then more recently, though, it's picked up. And in the last few weeks, VMT in the U.S. is down, say, 5%. And I'm talking about passenger cars, truck miles has actually been positive really since last summer, but almost our revenue relates to passenger vehicles, and that's what we focus on. In -- as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, the European activity and mobility, again, in the first quarter, started off really slow. It did rebound. And here in April, we're still below 2019 levels. But only down kind of low, we believe low single digits from a VMT perspective in Europe, but there are some variations country by country. 
So when you look at -- the question behind your question, I believe, is when do we get back to 2019 kind of revenue levels at VMT levels, right? And We think in the United States, it's going to take us a bit longer. We think it's going to take until 2022 to get back to 2019 levels in Europe, which is a little bit closer from a starting point perspective, we can see getting back to 2019 levels in the third or fourth quarter of this year. It all depends on how the vaccine gets rolled out and whether people truly get back on the road.

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details, including our banner margin and free cash flow performance as well as our improved 2021 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks.
Wow, we've come a long way over the past 12 months. A year ago at this time, the threat of the pandemic had become a tremendous and painful reality. Immediately, our teams got into action with a key focus across the entire organization to rightsize the cost structure and maximize cash flow. In order to adjust to this new paradigm, our teams had to make some very difficult decisions to protect the long-term health of our company and, in the past 3 quarters, have proven that our ability to reset the cost structure of LKQ. Our global leadership team firmly believed we would come out of the pandemic period stronger and a better organization, and our performance this past quarter absolutely confirms that belief.
Let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which, in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And finally, we will continue to invest in our future.
As you can see from our results, our segment teams executed on each of these initiatives in the first quarter. Alongside these operating initiatives, the continued build-out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization. As promised during our last earnings call, on April 6, we released our inaugural Corporate Sustainability Report. This report validates our long-term commitment to enhancing our ESG practices and will serve as a guidepost for the further embedding of ESG principles throughout our global operations.
Slide 16 of today's earnings deck provides a brief 1-page overview of the CSR report. If you have not already done so, I would highly encourage you to visit our website and download a copy of the full CSR.
Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was $3.17 billion, an increase of 5.7% as compared to $3 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Parts and services organic revenue in the first quarter of 2021 increased 0.6% on a reported basis and 2.2% on a per-day basis, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 0.6% and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 4.2%. Total parts and services revenue increased 4.2% in the quarter.
The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the initial pandemic impact last March. Through February, organic parts and services revenue was 4.4% lower on a per-day basis. In March, organic parts and services revenue grew by 15.7% on a per day basis, recognizing we were coming off a lower comparable period.
Other revenue grew 27% in the first quarter of 2021, driven by higher scrap steel and precious metal prices. While consolidated revenue is still running below pre-COVID levels, net income for the first quarter was $266 million as compared to $146 million last year, an increase of 83% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 was $0.88, an increase of 83%.
On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter was $286 million, a 62% increase year-over-year; while adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.94, a 65% increase. Each of our segments achieved EBITDA margins well ahead of our expectations due to excellent execution, a continued focus on our cost structure and with respect to North America, tailwinds from scrap and precious metals pricing. When taken collectively, these strong performances allowed LKQ to record, record consolidated segment EBITDA margins of 14.2% in the first quarter. This was a 350 basis point increase relative to the first quarter of last year.
Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter, and as you can see, all segments were positive in March on a per-day basis. Obviously, during the tail end of February and the entire month of March, we were working from an easier comp, but we also benefited as mobility began to gain ground in certain markets.
Additionally, the penetration rate of the vaccine in the United States is encouraging. And as these trends gain ground in other key markets, we should begin to see a loosening of the stay-at-home mandates, and we would expect a gradual improvement in vehicle miles traveled or VMT. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, at the end of the second week of April, fuel consumption was 71% above the prior year and just 3% below that same week of 2019.
According to the Apple Mobility Index, the trend in driving trips in our European markets was down early in the year relative to the third and fourth quarter levels of 2020. But as we progressed through Q1, the index rebounded, and by the third week of April, the index had increased 33% from the first week of January. So there are clearly some green shoots of momentum in VMT around the globe, albeit were still below pre-COVID levels.
Turning to North America. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 8.4% in the quarter on a reported basis and 7.0% on a per-day basis. While still down on a year-over-year basis, it is an improvement relative to Q4 of last year. We continue to outpace the market in North America especially when you consider that industry data suggests that collision and liability-related repairable auto claims declined approximately 14% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior period.
Relative to the competitive landscape, we are confident that we are gaining market share from small salvage and aftermarket operators that are typically capital-constrained and facing lower inventory levels due to product availability and cost inflation. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to continue to invest in our North American business, including inventory replenishment, and also in various technologies and programs to further enhance the efficiency of our operations and the service experience for our customers. With capital constraints, many smaller competitors lack the flexibility to stay relevant and competitive.
During the first quarter, our North American operations benefited from the disruption to the OE component supply chain, which impacted the OE's ability to build major mechanical inventory. This lack of major mechanical inventory for the OEs, combined with our robust levels of recycled and remanufactured engines and transmission products, provided the opportunity for our North American business to gain share in the quarter. Our salvage operations have been extremely judicious in their procurement efforts and selling more parts from the vehicles we procure, enabling us to have stronger fulfillment rates than the industry average.
In North America, during the first quarter, we continued our environmental stewardship efforts by processing 190,000 vehicles resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 900,000 gallons of fuel; 491,000 gallons of waste oil; 482,000 tires; and 176,000 batteries. During the first quarter, we also processed approximately 282,000 tons of scrap steel.
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the first quarter increased 30 basis points as the largest pure-play distributor of aftermarket automotive parts in Europe. This is a solid start to 2021, even in the face of continuing COVID lockdowns in several regions of Europe. Our regional operations experienced varying revenue performance in the quarter, with positive year-over-year performance in Germany, Benelux and Eastern Europe, with some softness in the U.K. and Italy continuing to drag on the overall performance of this segment.
Specific to the U.K., in addition to our 2-step distribution business of mechanical service parts, we operate a few other businesses, including our collision parts and coatings businesses, which registered materially lower growth than our 2-step mechanical parts distribution business in the first quarter. Importantly, with our corporate-wide focus on profitable revenue, we spent the past year rationalizing the footprint of our U.K. business, which eliminated over 40 unprofitable branches, resulting in a small negative impact on revenue but a significant improvement in EBITDA margins.
Revenue growth from our ongoing mechanical service parts operations was positive in the quarter, while our data indicates the overall U.K. market was down on a year-over-year basis. In total, we are delighted with the performance of our U.K. operations.
Other items of note in Europe include: the fact that we continued to add talent and expect the organizational design elements of the 1 LKQ Europe program will be largely completed by the end of Q2; the fourth central distribution center project remains right on track; our ERP implementation at Rhiag Italy also remains on track for a Q2 go-live, which will make it the first large platform company on our new European ERP system; and we continue to expand our payables optimization initiatives, which includes the vendor financing program.
Lastly, on Europe, and consistent with our ESG programs, we recently launched an electric delivery vehicle trial for our U.K. and Republic of Ireland operations. The pilot will run for about 6 months and will take into account the charging point infrastructure to identify branches with vans whose typical mileage is suited to the range and capability of an electric vehicle. LKQ is also considering pilot projects with fuel cell-powered heavy trucks once those vehicles and filling stations become available.
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which absolutely knocked the cover off the ball during the first quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.9%. This represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since we bought this business in 2014, with Q4 of last year being the second highest quarter. The primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RVs and RV parts. The RV Industry Association's February 2021 survey of manufacturers determined that total RV shipments increased 30%, making it the best February RV unit shipment total on record. This is good for LKQ on a longer-term basis, as a larger RV park should lead to more RV parts sales in the future.
Also driving the Specialty performance was the demand for light truck parts we offer, which, during the first quarter, increased 17% year-over-year, with strong demand for products installed on jeeps and pickup trucks. We believe that the third round of stimulus checks benefited our Specialty business in the quarter.
Across all of our segments, and like many others in vehicle parts distribution, we are witnessing some supply chain disruptions, which have led to incremental cost in freight, labor and cost of goods sold. Related to ocean freight, that container capacity constraints that we first experienced last fall continues to be a challenge. Our supply chain teams across the globe are in constant communication with our suppliers working to procure the products we need to maintain and grow our market share in each of our segments. Importantly, we have witnessed minimal impact to our fulfillment and customer service levels and believe the inventory challenges are subsiding.
As it relates to inflationary risk, we remain cautious near term. But as we progress through the year, we are expecting a continuing pandemic recovery, which would benefit each of our operating segments. Again, we expect to see continued inflation related to freight, labor and cost of goods sold. That said, as witnessed throughout 2020 and in the first quarter of this year, we have a number of levers that we can pull to help offset these inflationary risks, including price.
From a corporate development perspective, in the first quarter, we acquired a diagnostics business that provides various mobile diagnostic and programming services to professional collision and mechanical repair shops in Nebraska. By year-end, this business will be fully integrated into our Elitek Vehicle Services brand. We have a couple of other diagnostic transactions in the pipeline.
Finally, I've previously noted several senior-level additions to the European team in the quarter, which will lead our efforts in the areas of strategy, sales, logistics and supply chain, product pricing and e-commerce. LKQ Europe is viewed by candidates as being a unique and extremely well-positioned enterprise with an exciting future. And we've been able to attract great talent from across the European automotive industry and digital channels.
At the corporate level, during the first quarter, we brought on a new Senior Vice President of Human Resources to the executive team. Genevieve brings a wealth of experience in managing a large, hourly-based workforce, and she has on-point experience in building programs focused on employee engagement and diversity and inclusion, key elements of our ESG initiatives.
Now I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong first quarter financial performance."
4303924,710873325,2262592,"LKQ Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today.We entered 2021 with strong momentum coming off the 2 highest quarterly results in the company's history, the third and fourth quarter of 2020. This morning, I'm pleased to report that we we",1787,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today.
We entered 2021 with strong momentum coming off the 2 highest quarterly results in the company's history, the third and fourth quarter of 2020. This morning, I'm pleased to report that we were able to build on that momentum in the first quarter and take advantage of some tailwinds to produce yet another record quarter.
As we've said repeatedly over the last year, we can't control when revenue growth will return to pre-COVID levels. However, we are able to manage our costs and have focused on rightsizing the cost structure and emphasizing efficiencies, so that we can generate operating leverage when revenue growth returns. The permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020 continued to drive year-over-year profitability growth. And encouragingly, we got an additional boost in the first quarter, as we were able to support the sequential revenue growth across all our segments without adding back costs at the same rate. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed this operating leverage, dropping to 26.8% in the quarter or 320 basis points better than Q1 of 2020. We were also able to improve our gross margin by being disciplined on pricing to ensure that our strong inventory availability and service levels were recognized in the industry.
We believe that these operational strengths are sustainable going forward and will drive our results as the recovery picks up pace as expected in the second half of the year. We saw this transpire in the month of March, as rebounding economic activity generated healthy revenue growth and cost controls limited the amount of incremental expenses, which resulted in the highest monthly profitability in the company's history.
I mentioned the benefit of tailwinds in the quarter, and commodity prices were most certainly significant. As you can see on Slide 20, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits in the quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $34 million in segment EBITDA, which would translate into about $0.08 in adjusted diluted EPS relative to the prior year. We expect that commodities will be in net benefit in the short term although likely at a lower level than Q1, as car costs continue to rise owing to the commodity price changes and further moderate in the second half of the year. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to pure operating performance.
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 19.9%. Q1 is the third consecutive quarter that we've been able to make the statement and is truly a testament to the resilience of the business and the management team's swift and decisive actions during the early days of the pandemic. The segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and the specific permanent cost reductions executed in 2020. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits I mentioned are seen here, helping to drive the North America margins above our long-term expectation.
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 9.6% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 390 basis point improvement over last year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the margin goal communicated last September at our Investor Day and reaffirmed in February following fourth quarter earnings. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery and cost containment actions taken last year, with more anticipated on both fronts.
Moving to Slide 12. As Nick described, the Specialty results are truly outstanding. We are super excited about the spectacular revenue growth, and we're really pleased with the way the segment team has delivered the growth without adding back significant operating costs or sacrificing gross margin. The segment EBITDA margin of 13.4% is the highest Q1 result in the segment's history by approximately 150 basis points and reflects the leverage benefit achieved in a period of rapid growth and the discipline to pursue profitable revenue growth.
We talked last year about the shift to an emphasis on operational excellence, and our first quarter results provide further evidence of this mindset taking hold. Each segment's disciplined execution of our strategic priorities has been excellent. We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. Deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these 2 factors added $0.02 per share to our Q1 '21 results. Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income generated another $0.03 of year-over-year growth.
Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 28% to 26.5%. The reduced rate relative to 30% rate used in Q1 of last year contributed approximately $0.025 of the year-over-year EPS growth.
So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $0.94 is a $0.37 increase over Q1 of 2020. The commodity benefit, along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced approximately $0.16 of that improvement. The remaining $0.21 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth, enhancing gross margins and controlling our overheads. And that should be the key takeaway when considering our Q1 profitability.
Now on to cash flow and liquidity. Q1 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. As shown on Slide 13, we delivered $523 million in operating cash flows, as we continued to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018 as benefits from payables more than offset the seasonal growth in receivables. We expected inventory to be a larger outflow in Q1, though ongoing supplier delivery challenges exacerbated by ocean freight challenges have pushed the build to later in the year. Despite the lower-than-anticipated inventory level, our teams, with the support of our vendor partners, skillfully ensured that the right parts were in the right places and thereby minimize stock-out issues so that our class-leading fill rate were maintained.
CapEx cash outlays were $42 million, resulting in free cash flow of $481 million. We used this cash to repay $83 million in debt and repurchased $57 million in LKQ stock. We also built our cash balance mostly in Europe in advance of the early redemption on April 1, which will be earliest possible redemption date of our EUR 0.75 billion euro notes due in 2026. We used the portion of the cash on hand to fund the redemption and drew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility. The redemption replaces the Eurobond with a coupon of 3 5/8% with credit facility borrowings approximately 250 basis points of lower cost. Do note that we had already anticipated the redemption and the resulting interest savings in our original earnings outlook provided in February.
On Slide 15, you can see the further progress we have made to strengthen our liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio has decreased to 1.4x from 1.9 at the end of 2020 owing to a strong profitability and cash flows in the first quarter. We believe that we are very well positioned in our stated pursuit of an investment-grade profile. We are also pleased with the positive developments on this objective with both S&P and Moody's upgrading our credit rating in the first quarter.
I will close with our updated thoughts on 2021. With the ongoing COVID uncertainties, especially concerning revenue trends, we are providing an abbreviated outlook. We are comfortable making the following statements, all of which presume that, one, additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not reimplemented or exacerbated in our major markets; two, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels; and finally, three, scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year.
With that, on revenue, we reaffirm our belief that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full year basis in 2021 versus 2020, with the most significant growth coming in the second quarter albeit off a low base. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will continue in the second half of the year, as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions decrease. But we do not currently expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue until 2022.
As discussed previously, we'll have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one already completed in Q1 and the second one in the fourth quarter, while Europe is flat with 1 fewer selling day in the first quarter but made up in the second quarter with the additional day.
The other piece I want to talk about was earnings per share. And with our strong first quarter performance, projected revenue growth and the ongoing benefit of our margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be significantly above the comparable figure for 2020. We are projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $3 to $3.20 with a midpoint of $3.10. On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.68 to $2.88. The $0.35 or 13% increase at the midpoint reflects the Q1 outperformance and upside in the projected results for the last 9 months compared to our prior outlook. We expect to achieve this upside while covering the effects of inflationary pressures being faced across the industry related to labor costs, ocean and domestic freight expenses and higher input costs, raising inventory prices.
And finally, on cash flow, we are indeed off to a terrific start in cash flow generation in Q1, which gives us the confidence to raise our minimum free cash flow expectation. We now project that free cash flow for the full year 2021 will be within the range of $850 million to $950 million with a midpoint of $900 million. We expect inventory purchases to represent an outflow over the remainder of the year, as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated growth. Essentially, it is just going to happen later in the year than we had previously anticipated. Some of the investment in inventory will be offset by continued improvements in days payables resulting from the European payables optimization program, which is producing benefits and tracking well in line with the target we have set out in September of 2019 when we initially launched the 1 LKQ Europe program.
So with that, thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

But as Varun indicated, we've been very disciplined on the pricing front, and there's no need to give away product at discounted prices, particularly in those cases where we're the only supplier that may have the product. So we've been very disciplined in our pricing. We have seen some creep in the cost of goods sold just because of the inflationary pressures at some of our suppliers. And we're doing our best to recover that and maintain gross margins. And we're comfortable with our approach. We have not seen significant pushback from our customers. The reality is we're not alone. I mean, the entire industry is facing the same set of conditions.
On the Specialty side, the growth there was largely due to volumes just going through the roof, which was terrific. And again, our Specialty team is paying particular attention to be really disciplined on the pricing front."

In the U.S. at a low point, really the second, third week of April 2020 being down better part of 55% or so.
If you look at really from kind of mid to late June through the November time frame, VMT in the United States was down in and around anywhere from 9% to 12% kind of week in, week out. So last part of 2020, it was down about 15% really from -- in through Thanksgiving into the end of the year. And then more recently though, it's picked up. And in the last few weeks, VMT in the U.S. is down, say, 5%. And I'm talking about passenger cars. Truck miles has actually been positive really since last summer, but almost our revenue relates to passenger vehicles, and that's what we focus on.
In -- as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, the European activity and mobility, again, in the first quarter started off really slow. It did rebound. And here in April, we're still below 2019 levels but only down kind of low, we believe, low single digits from a VMT perspective in Europe. But there are some variations country by country.
So when you look at -- the question behind your question, I believe, is when do we get back to 2019 kind of revenue levels and VMT levels, right? And we think in the United States, it's going to take us a bit longer. We think it's going to take until 2022 to get back to 2019 levels in Europe, which is a little bit closer from a starting point perspective. We can see getting back to 2019 levels in the third or fourth quarter of this year. It all depends on how the vaccine gets rolled out and whether people truly get back on the road. And then the Specialty business has been running above 2019 levels for several quarters now, and so that's a little bit different."

We've talked previously also commodity prices are incredibly volatile. We're certainly benefiting from the upswing at this point of time, with a sequential rise.

The question really is, we believe our salvage teams, self-service and full service, are by far the best in the industry and essentially are doing an incredible job in operationally taking advantage of the upswing out there.

that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic, and we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy, which is systematically implementing a lean road map to optimize those KPIs. And we are transitioning the team to a daily management system, which addresses safety, quality, delivery and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions, along with sustainable sharing of best practices. 
In Q2, our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize procurement of established vehicles we've done at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images. To assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. 
Additionally, during the quarter, our Elite Tech business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming. 
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis and 19.2% on a same-day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our U.K. business had the strongest recovery largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition, and we are confident we are gaining share in the U.K. market. 
I am also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic, but it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment. 
As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our One LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7% in the second quarter of 2021. 
In reality, there have been 2 distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized Pan-European leadership team and functional structure. 
The other is [ executulated ], which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects. 
Over the past 2 years, we have been working both components simultaneously, and I'm happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats and a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come. 
A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July, we began onboarding the first group of about 25 employees for our innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland. Support CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track, and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022 and our ERP implementation at Riag, in Italy went live on July 5. Some of you may have noted that on July 14, the European Commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates in details plans for a greener economy, and reducing net admissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. 
As a leader in the circular economy, and the largest vehicle on parts we cycler worldwide, LKQ embraces this global effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Our European segment and also Mekonomen where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. 
According to AMAE, the manufacturing -- Automobile Manufacturing Association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not that sold in rational way forward. And internal combustion engines, including hybrids, need to play a role in the transition to 0 emission. 
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. which, again, not the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continue to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling costs. 
We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the specialty business in the quarter. Across all of our segments, we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which, in turn, is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by our margin performance. 
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our sites to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. 
From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. 
Also in Q2, Warn acquired FabTech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. FabTech brands, which include Dirt Logic and Stealth Shocks, our widely recognized premium offerings in the off-road racing and performance segments and are a tremendous complement to our line of worn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car park and to leverage our robust networks across all segments sell deeper into existing and prospective customers. 
Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past 2 years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group. 
Also, earlier this month, ISS significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter. 
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance."
4303924,1673164177,2353999,"LKQ Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to [indiscernible] fast. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018,",1753,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to [indiscernible] fast. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation move towards targeting investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures and getting the validation of an investment-grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous for achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the Stahlgruber acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA. 
As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1x net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2x as of June of 2021. 
Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly [ 35% ] being the current share price. We have not sacrificed investments in the business. During this period with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tap-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last 3 years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter. 
First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the EUR 3.75 billion 2026 notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date with funds from our lower-cost revolver as well as cash in hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again, using funds from the revolver and cash on hand. And we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date. 
With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by a smaller facility. So we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further. We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value, and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to pay shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. 
Since we were nearing our $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October of 2024. 
Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more north worthy as it came in a period in which input cost rules across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in pricing and the distributor we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain. 
Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year. While we started to annualize some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth. dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to rating performance. 
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving cost part of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $255 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. 
Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage I mentioned earlier are seen here helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation. 
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With the year-to-date margin at 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing and cost containment actions taken in the last year. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014. 
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. 
Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. 
Given the improved expectation of formula profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25%, which had a nominal benefit of the quarter. 
So to recap. Our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.50 increase from Q2 of 2020, which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefit along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs, and this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results. 
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels, and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year. 
Number one, we believe that a part and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full year basis, and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments,in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rate to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business. 
While we expect demand for our specialty products will remain strong, we anticipate the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. 
As discussed previously, we will have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021 with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter while Europe is flat for the year overall, with 1 day shifting from Q1 into Q2. 
Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with a midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2.-- In addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year as we expect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment to outweigh strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry. 
And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we've made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. 
With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to [ $1.50 billion], with $1 billion at the midpoint. We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. If the interim, our teams with the active support of the vendor partners continue to expertly navigate tuition to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. 
And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow. 
Thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Yes, incredibly pleased with -- the company is really firing on all cylinders across revenue, margin, but also free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it. 
With regards to your specific question about the recent investment grade initiation by Fitch. In itself, it makes no change to either our credit facility or for that matter vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece, we have a prewired clause, which essentially states that if 1 of the 2 currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us an investment-grade rating, the leads of our senior secured facility drop off. And that, as you can imagine, is a significant number. which, of course, is just $3.5 billion credit facility. So that's 1 piece where the leans drop off and it becomes unsecured. The second piece is within the credit facility, we have a current ceiling that our indebtedness to for trade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change any today, but clearly, being 1 of the 3 key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us. I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other 2 rating agencies, they too will come on. I don't believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when."

Before I get to the specifics of answering your question, I just want to make sure that all of our 43-plus thousand associates globally are given a big shout out. What our field teams have done globally from a branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ, success is directly attributable to our field teams. The last 17, 18 months have not been easy, but they are the ones that have kept this company humming along and really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter. 
Yes, you're right. With regards to our North America margins, at 20.8% in the current quarter or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been as I've been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently in my prepared comments, Precious metals have been a benefit, and we estimate and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading and really what level of benefit has come through. We estimate roughly 350 basis points of the 20.8% margin that North America has put up is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices. Even if you were to take a piece out, the business is still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort. It could be had done better perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures. I say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor, and labor essentially, whether it be availability or whether it be the cost to get that labor. It is leading to congestions in ports, it's leading to higher freight costs because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find, but that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle in terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams. We have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up wholesale just to make sure that we are market competitive, but we have got branch managers, plant managers, DMs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business. And just want to make sure that, that is loud and clear, our field folks did just an outstanding job."

So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year and the whole diagnostics and calibration space, and we're building up a very nice business there. as you know, and we mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2 that relates to battery technologies. And again, we all know that ultimately battery being able to service and deal with the EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important. So you should expect additional investment in that area. 
So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set and the services is a key component there. relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy.

So if you think about the size and scale of our European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is. And we certainly see that there's further upside out there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180-day ceiling obviously gets lifted. That's more of a tactical piece, but more an ongoing as the team, how that continues, it's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners.

Obviously, the supply chain, not just in our industry, but in most industries, is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends on actually the business and the product line because there's significant differences across the LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact because all that product is here, and it's easy for us to get at the auctions. Our aftermarket business here, however, most of the aftermarket collision product for the whole industry, not just us, comes out of Taiwan. And it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product, the manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka or whatever we need here in the U.S. And everyone knows what's going on, the issues related to container capacity port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water, just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the drayage within the ports. That mean you're moving the cans around. And then there's a shortage of of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. 
So what's that doing? It's extending the time frame of how long it takes us to get product and it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eightfold. The good news is, again, we're under contract. We bring in 15,000 containers a year. That's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year, or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace. 
Now you move over to specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some product in from the Far East. And we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And they are the real issues, the capacity of the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our specialty group. We've said in the past quarters and this quarter was true as well. We've probably lost some revenue because we didn't have product on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor in what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors. 
And Europe is somewhere in between, Brett. I mean the reality is they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. but they are also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through"

Let me take that question. So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform -- If you go back when we initiated the One LKQ Europe program and formally do have margin targets, we basically call for exiting sustainable double-digit margins at the end of 2021. That was in September of 2019. And amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last 6 months of that 3-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times with a pandemic cloning for good measure has been nothing short of phenomenal. We're really pleased with the team out there. As you obviously have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there at this point of time, very optimistic about the future also. to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really, if you actually go back and see the European business historically and obviously take out 2020 because that was the pandemic here. or at least and it's still continuing. But if you go back historically, Q1 and Q2 typically are strong. Q3 is also relatively strong, but in Q4 is typically seasonally the weakest for our European business. 
So it really is kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else as of now. There obviously are a lot of flip flop measures taking place is the country open, is the country not opened. Yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows, whether that continues or not. About 4 weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually. All of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland with the exception of our U.K. leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there. But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially what has led us to the first half performance, but also gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2% up to 10.3%, up by about 30 basis points to 9.5% to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business. 
Let me kind of just -- one final piece also say, these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag, but that is the way we've been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted includes at least in the first half, a 20 basis points drag. You can obviously take that away. And clearly, we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half."

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before I come back with a few closing remarks. 
This was another quarter of significant operating progress, driven by excellent execution and improved business conditions. I cannot be prouder of the LKQ team. 
A few years ago, when we pivoted to operational excellence, we knew that there would be a transition period, during which we would need to invest in our people and processes to improve the operating model. We also recognized that there would be difficult decisions needed to rightsize the cost structure and drive efficiencies. We undertook this shift with the expectation that we would come out the other side as a leaner, more nimble and stronger organization. One that could succeed in difficult conditions, like we have seen with the pandemic over the past year as well as thrive during the good times. Those expectations are being realized. While I'm not ready to proclaim mission accomplished, I believe we have made tremendous progress in our operational excellence transition as evidenced by the continued outstanding results that we've delivered over the past year. 
Record outcomes don't happen by accident, and the team has driven strong profitability and cash flow by among other actions, applying a disciplined pricing approach, implementing permanent cost saving actions, including closing underperforming locations, consolidating delivery routes and reducing headcount, tightening our operating policies to reduce waste and increase yield, such as harvesting more catalytic converters per car, actively engaging with our vendor partners to ensure that we are receiving attractive pricing and market payment terms. And monitoring our receivables so that we minimize past due balances. 
Now on to the quarter. We were able to produce yet another record quarter. Indeed, each of the last four quarters' results represents the highest earnings per share reported in the respective quarters with Q2 of 2021, reflecting the first quarter with over $1 of earnings per share and the highest segment EBITDA margins in over a decade. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly. 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 31% as compared to the $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020. 
In the second quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 22%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3/10 of 1% and exchange rates increased revenue 5.4%. This creates a total parts and services revenue increase of 27%. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the pandemic impact during Q2 of 2020. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $305 million as compared to $119 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 157%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.01 as compared to $0.39 for the same period last year, an increase of 159%. 
On an adjusted basis, net income in the second quarter was $340 million compared to $161 million in the same period of 2020, a 111% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.13 as compared to $0.53 for the same period of 2020, a 113% increase. 
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 of our presentation sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter. And as you can see, coming off the low base of the second quarter of 2020, the growth rates improved significantly year-over-year for each of the segments, with April and May being the most notable. 
The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets is encouraging. Europe, in particular, witnessed a solid increase in vaccinations throughout the second quarter, although it still lags the United States. We, like many, are closely monitoring the delta variance and the risk of policy actions potentially slowing economic growth if the variants were to rapidly spread. 
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the second quarter was 28% above the prior year and 5% below the second quarter of 2019. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 19.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims data in the quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the second quarter of 2019. 
During Q2, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 9% on a per day basis relative to 2019, while repairable claims declined 15%. So another period of outperformance for our North American operations. 
I want to highlight a couple of examples of how the North American team continues to push the operational excellence initiatives. In 2019, our North American team initiated a lean operating strategy based on the principle of doing more with less. 
During the first step of this strategy, the team asked the simple question. What does winning look like? The answers to that question allowed the team to unify and develop several key performance indicators that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic that we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy, which is systematically implementing a lean road map to optimize those KPIs. And we are transitioning the team to a daily management system, which addresses safety, quality, delivery and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions, along with sustainable sharing of best practices. 
In Q2, our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize procurement of established vehicles we've done at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images. To assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. 
Additionally, during the quarter, our Elite Tech business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming. 
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis and 19.2% on a same-day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our U.K. business had the strongest recovery largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition, and we are confident we are gaining share in the U.K. market. 
I am also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic, but it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment. 
As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our One LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7% in the second quarter of 2021. 
In reality, there have been 2 distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized Pan-European leadership team and functional structure. 
The other is [ executulated ], which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects. 
Over the past 2 years, we have been working both components simultaneously, and I'm happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats and a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come. 
A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July, we began onboarding the first group of about 25 employees for our innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland. Support CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track, and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022 and our ERP implementation at Riag, in Italy went live on July 5. Some of you may have noted that on July 14, the European Commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates in details plans for a greener economy, and reducing net admissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. 
As a leader in the circular economy, and the largest vehicle on parts we cycler worldwide, LKQ embraces this global effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Our European segment and also Mekonomen where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. 
According to AMAE, the manufacturing -- Automobile Manufacturing Association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not that sold in rational way forward. And internal combustion engines, including hybrids, need to play a role in the transition to 0 emission. 
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. which, again, not the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continue to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling costs. 
We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the specialty business in the quarter. Across all of our segments, we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which, in turn, is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by our margin performance. 
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our sites to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. 
From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. 
Also in Q2, Warn acquired FabTech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. FabTech brands, which include Dirt Logic and Stealth Shocks, our widely recognized premium offerings in the off-road racing and performance segments and are a tremendous complement to our line of worn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car park and to leverage our robust networks across all segments sell deeper into existing and prospective customers. 
Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past 2 years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group. 
Also, earlier this month, ISS significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter. 
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance."
4303924,1673164177,2354042,"LKQ Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to [indiscernible] fast. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018,",1753,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to [indiscernible] fast. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation move towards targeting investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures and getting the validation of an investment-grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous for achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the Stahlgruber acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA. 
As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1x net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2x as of June of 2021. 
Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly [ 35% ] being the current share price. We have not sacrificed investments in the business. During this period with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tap-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last 3 years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter. 
First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the EUR 3.75 billion 2026 notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date with funds from our lower-cost revolver as well as cash in hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again, using funds from the revolver and cash on hand. And we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date. 
With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by a smaller facility. So we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further. We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value, and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to pay shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. 
Since we were nearing our $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October of 2024. 
Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more north worthy as it came in a period in which input cost rules across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in pricing and the distributor we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain. 
Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year. While we started to annualize some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth. dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to rating performance. 
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving cost part of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $255 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. 
Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage I mentioned earlier are seen here helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation. 
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With the year-to-date margin at 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing and cost containment actions taken in the last year. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014. 
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. 
Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. 
Given the improved expectation of formula profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25%, which had a nominal benefit of the quarter. 
So to recap. Our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.50 increase from Q2 of 2020, which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefit along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs, and this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results. 
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels, and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year. 
Number one, we believe that a part and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full year basis, and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments,in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rate to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business. 
While we expect demand for our specialty products will remain strong, we anticipate the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. 
As discussed previously, we will have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021 with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter while Europe is flat for the year overall, with 1 day shifting from Q1 into Q2. 
Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with a midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2.-- In addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year as we expect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment to outweigh strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry. 
And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we've made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. 
With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to [ $1.50 billion], with $1 billion at the midpoint. We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. If the interim, our teams with the active support of the vendor partners continue to expertly navigate tuition to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. 
And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow. 
Thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Yes, incredibly pleased with -- the company is really firing on all cylinders across revenue, margin, but also free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it. 
With regards to your specific question about the recent investment grade initiation by Fitch. In itself, it makes no change to either our credit facility or for that matter vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece, we have a prewired clause, which essentially states that if 1 of the 2 currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us an investment-grade rating, the leads of our senior secured facility drop off. And that, as you can imagine, is a significant number. which, of course, is just $3.5 billion credit facility. So that's 1 piece where the leans drop off and it becomes unsecured. The second piece is within the credit facility, we have a current ceiling that our indebtedness to for trade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change any today, but clearly, being 1 of the 3 key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us. I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other 2 rating agencies, they too will come on. I don't believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when."

Before I get to the specifics of answering your question, I just want to make sure that all of our 43-plus thousand associates globally are given a big shout out. What our field teams have done globally from a branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ, success is directly attributable to our field teams. The last 17, 18 months have not been easy, but they are the ones that have kept this company humming along and really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter. 
Yes, you're right. With regards to our North America margins, at 20.8% in the current quarter or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been as I've been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently in my prepared comments, Precious metals have been a benefit, and we estimate and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading and really what level of benefit has come through. We estimate roughly 350 basis points of the 20.8% margin that North America has put up is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices. Even if you were to take a piece out, the business is still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort. It could be had done better perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures. I say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor, and labor essentially, whether it be availability or whether it be the cost to get that labor. It is leading to congestions in ports, it's leading to higher freight costs because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find, but that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle in terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams. We have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up wholesale just to make sure that we are market competitive, but we have got branch managers, plant managers, DMs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business. And just want to make sure that, that is loud and clear, our field folks did just an outstanding job."

So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year and the whole diagnostics and calibration space, and we're building up a very nice business there. as you know, and we mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2 that relates to battery technologies. And again, we all know that ultimately battery being able to service and deal with the EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important. So you should expect additional investment in that area. 
So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set and the services is a key component there. relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy.

Our North American business a we have some opportunity, but if you think of the salvage business, whether self serve or full serve, this a different business model, right? 
So if you think about the size and scale of our European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is. And we certainly see that there's further upside out there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180-day ceiling obviously gets lifted. That's more of a tactical piece, but more an ongoing as the team, how that continues, it's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners. The focus really had been, let's get through the top 40 and then the team continues to go further down the chain.

Obviously, the supply chain, not just in our industry, but in most industries, is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends on actually the business and the product line because there's significant differences across the LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact because all that product is here, and it's easy for us to get at the auctions. Our aftermarket business here, however, most of the aftermarket collision product for the whole industry, not just us, comes out of Taiwan. And it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product, the manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka or whatever we need here in the U.S. And everyone knows what's going on, the issues related to container capacity port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water, just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the drayage within the ports. That mean you're moving the cans around. And then there's a shortage of of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. 
So what's that doing? It's extending the time frame of how long it takes us to get product and it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eightfold. The good news is, again, we're under contract. We bring in 15,000 containers a year. That's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year, or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace. 
Now you move over to specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some product in from the Far East. And we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And they are the real issues, the capacity of the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our specialty group. We've said in the past quarters and this quarter was true as well. We've probably lost some revenue because we didn't have product on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor in what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors. 
And Europe is somewhere in between, Brett. I mean the reality is they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. but they are also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through"

Let me take that question. So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform -- If you go back when we initiated the One LKQ Europe program and formally do have margin targets, we basically call for exiting sustainable double-digit margins at the end of 2021. That was in September of 2019. And amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last 6 months of that 3-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times with a pandemic cloning for good measure has been nothing short of phenomenal. We're really pleased with the team out there. As you obviously have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there at this point of time, very optimistic about the future also. to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really, if you actually go back and see the European business historically and obviously take out 2020 because that was the pandemic here. or at least and it's still continuing. But if you go back historically, Q1 and Q2 typically are strong. Q3 is also relatively strong, but in Q4 is typically seasonally the weakest for our European business. 
So it really is kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else as of now. There obviously are a lot of flip flop measures taking place is the country open, is the country not opened. Yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows, whether that continues or not. About 4 weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually. All of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland with the exception of our U.K. leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there. But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially what has led us to the first half performance, but also gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2% up to 10.3%, up by about 30 basis points to 9.5% to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business. 
Let me kind of just -- one final piece also say, these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag, but that is the way we've been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted includes at least in the first half, a 20 basis points drag. You can obviously take that away. And clearly, we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half."

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before I come back with a few closing remarks.
This was another quarter of significant operating progress, driven by excellent execution and improved business conditions. I cannot be prouder of the LKQ team. A few years ago, when we pivoted to operational excellence, we knew that there would be a transition period during which we would need to invest in our people and processes to improve the operating model. We also recognize that there would be difficult decisions needed to rightsize the cost structure and drive efficiencies. We undertook this shift with the expectation that we would come out the other side as a leaner, more nimble and stronger organization, one that could succeed in difficult conditions like we have seen with the pandemic over the past year as well as thrive during the good times. Those expectations are being realized. While I'm not ready to proclaim mission accomplished, I believe we have made tremendous progress in our operational excellence transition as evidenced by the continued outstanding results that we've delivered over the past year.
Record outcomes don't happen by accident. And the team has driven strong profitability and cash flow by, among other actions, applying a disciplined pricing approach; implementing permanent cost-saving actions, including closing underperforming locations, consolidating delivery routes and reducing headcount; tightening our operating policies to reduce waste and increase yield, such as harvesting more catalytic converters per car; actively engaging with our vendor partners to ensure that we are receiving attractive pricing and market payment terms; and monitoring our receivables, so that we minimize past due balances.
Now on to the quarter. We were able to produce yet another record quarter. Indeed, each of the last four quarters' results represents the highest earnings per share reported in the respective quarters, with Q2 of 2021 reflecting the first quarter with over $1 of earnings per share and the highest segment EBITDA margins in over a decade. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 31% as compared to the $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 22%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 0.3%, and foreign exchange rates increased revenue 5.4%. This creates a total parts and services revenue increase of 27%. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the pandemic impact during Q2 of 2020.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $305 million as compared to $119 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 157%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.01 as compared to $0.39 for the same period last year, an increase of 159%.
On an adjusted basis, net income in the second quarter was $340 million compared to $161 million in the same period of 2020, a 111% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.13 as compared to $0.53 for the same period of 2020, a 113% increase.
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 of our presentation sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter. And as you can see, coming off the low base of the second quarter of 2020, the growth rates improved significantly year-over-year for each of the segments, with April and May being the most notable.
The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets is encouraging. Europe, in particular, witnessed a solid increase in vaccinations throughout the second quarter, although it still lags the United States. We, like many, are closely monitoring the Delta variant and the risk of policy actions potentially slowing the economic growth if the variants were to rapidly spread. 
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the second quarter was 28% above the prior year and 5% below the second quarter of 2019.
From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 19.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims data in the quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the second quarter of 2019.
During Q2, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 9% on a per day basis relative to 2019, while repairable claims declined 15%, so another period of outperformance for our North American operations.
I want to highlight a couple of examples of how the North American team continues to push the operational excellence initiatives. In 2019, our North American team initiated a lean operating strategy based on the principle of doing more with less. During the first step of this strategy, the team asked the simple question, what does winning look like? The answers to that question allowed the team to unify and develop several key performance indicators that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic, and we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy, which is systematically implementing a lean road map to optimize those KPIs. We are transitioning the team to a daily management system, which addresses safety, quality, delivery and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions, along with sustainable sharing of best practices.
In Q2, our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize the procurement of the salvage vehicles we've bid on at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images to assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. Additionally, during the quarter, our Elitek business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming.
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis and 19.2% on a same-day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our U.K. business had the strongest recovery, largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition, and we are confident we are gaining share in the U.K. market. I am also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic. But it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment.
As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7% in the second quarter of 2021. In reality, there have been 2 distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized pan-European leadership team and functional structure. The other is execution-related, which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects.
Over the past 2 years, we have been working both components simultaneously, and I'm happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats and a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come.
A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July, we began onboarding the first group of about 25 employees for our innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland. The 4 CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track, and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022. And our ERP implementation at Rhiag in Italy went live on July 5.
Some of you may have noted that on July 14, the European Commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates in details plans for a greener economy and reducing net admissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. As a leader in the circular economy and the largest vehicle and parts recycler worldwide, LKQ embraces the global effort to reduce CO2 emissions.
Our European segment and also Mekonomen, where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. According to ACEA, the manufacturing -- automobile manufacturing association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not the sole and rational way forward. And internal combustion engines, including hybrids, need to play a role in the transition to zero emissions.
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which, again, knocked the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continue to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling cost. We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the Specialty business in the quarter.
Across all of our segments, we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which, in turn, is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by our margin performance.
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract.
From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. Also in Q2, Warn acquired Fabtech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. Fabtech brands, which include Dirt Logic and Stealth Shocks, are widely recognized premium offerings in the off-road racing and performance segments, and they're a tremendous complement to our line of Warn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car park and to leverage our robust networks across all segments to sell deeper into existing and prospective customers.
Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past 2 years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group.
Also, earlier this month, ISS significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter.
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who'll run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance."
4303924,1673164177,2354334,"LKQ Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today.Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operati",1759,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today.
Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation move towards targeting investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities.
I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures, and getting the validation of an investment-grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow, which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA.
As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1x net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2x as of June of 2021. Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly 35% below the current share price.
We have not sacrificed investments in the business during this period, with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution, acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tuck-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last 3 years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter.
First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the EUR 0.75 billion 2026 euro notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date, with funds from our lower-cost revolver as well as cash on hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again, using funds from the revolver and cash on hand. And we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date.
With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by a smaller facility, so we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further.
We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value, and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to purchase shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July, with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. Since we were nearing our $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October of 2024.
Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more noteworthy as it came in a period in which input cost rules across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in our pricing and in distributor we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain.
Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year.
While we started to annualize some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth, dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to operating performance.
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters, as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving cost out of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $25 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage I mentioned earlier are seen here, helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation.
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With the year-to-date margin at 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing and cost containment actions taken in the last year.
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014.
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation of full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25%, which had a nominal benefit on the quarter.
So to recap. Our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.60 increase from Q2 of 2020, which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefit along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs, and this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results.
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels, and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year.
Number one, we believe that our parts and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full year basis, and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments,in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rates to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter, as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business.
While we expect demand for our Specialty products will remain strong, we anticipate the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. As discussed previously, we will have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter. While Europe is flat for the year overall, with 1 day shifting from Q1 into Q2.
Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with a midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2 in addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year, as we expect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment to outweigh strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry.
And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we've made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to $1.050 billion, with $1 billion at the midpoint.
We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. In the interim, our teams, with the active support of the vendor partners, continue to expertly navigate the situation to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. 
And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow.
Thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Yes, incredibly pleased with the company really firing on all cylinders across revenue, margin, but also free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it.
With regards to your specific question about the recent investment-grade rating initiation by Fitch, in itself, it makes no change to either our credit facility or, for that matter, vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece, we have a prewired clause, which essentially states that if 1 of the 2 currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us an investment-grade rating, the leans of our senior secured facility drop off. And that, as you can imagine, is a significant number, which, of course, is this [ $3.5 billion ] credit facility. So that's one piece where the leans drop off and it becomes unsecured.
The second piece is, within the credit facility, we have a current ceiling that our indebtedness, too, for trade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change any today, but clearly, being 1 of the 3 key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us. I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other 2 rating agencies, they, too, will come around. I don't believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when."

What our field teams have done globally from a branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ success is directly attributable to our field teams. The last 17, 18 months have not been easy, but they are the ones that have kept this company humming along and really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter.
Yes, you're right. With regards to our North America margins, at 20.8% in the current quarter or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been. As I've been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently in my prepared comments, precious metals have been a benefit, and we estimate -- and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading and really what level of benefit has come through. We estimate roughly 350 basis points of the 20.8% margin that North America has put up is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices.
Even if you were to take a piece out, the business has still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort. Could we have done better? Perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures. I say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor. And labor essentially, whether it be availability or whether it be the cost to get that labor, it is leading to congestions at ports, it's leading to higher freight costs because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find, but that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle in terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams.
We have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up wholesale just to make sure that we are market competitive. But we have got branch managers, plant managers, DMs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business. And just want to make sure that, that is heard loud and clear, our field folks have done an outstanding job."

Second would be freight. And that not only relates to ocean freight, which is up significantly, but also the domestic freight, whether it be in the U.S. or in Europe. And then some people put fuel as part of freight. We try and separate it out. Obviously, if you can track oil prices, they've been up as well.
I'd point you to Page 7 of our deck, which kind of sorts out where we have saved money over the past year or so.

So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year in the whole diagnostics and calibration space, and we're building up a very nice business there.
As you know, and we mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2 that relates to battery technologies. And again, we all know that ultimately, battery -- being able to service and deal with the EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important, so you should expect additional investment in that area.
So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set, and the services is a key component there, relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller. Because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy. So we can, again, make sure that we are on the cutting edge as it relates to what we can provide our customers."

The biggest uplift really will be from our European business. And just given the nature of the European business and how we compare that from a payables optimization program relative to say the big 4 here on the hard parts site in North America. Our North American business per se, we have some opportunity. But if you think of the salvage business, whether self-serve or full-serve, it's just a different business model, right?
So if you think about the size and scale of our European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is. And we certainly see that there's further upside out there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment-grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180-day ceiling obviously gets lifted. That's more of a tactical piece. But more an ongoing basis, as the team, how that continues, it's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners. The focus really had been, let's get through the top 40, and then the team continues to go further down the chain as part of the overall supplier rationalization discussions, making sure that we continue to get COGS at attractive prices, but also at what we believe to be market convention terms."

Obviously, the supply chain, not just in our industry, but in most industries, is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends on actually the business and the product line because there's significant differences across the LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact because all that product is here, and it's easy for us to get at the auctions.
Our aftermarket business here, however, most of the aftermarket collision product for the whole industry, not just us, comes out of Taiwan. And it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product. The manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka or whatever we need them here in the U.S. And everyone knows what's going on, the issues related to container capacity. Port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the drayage within the ports. That means you're moving the cans around. And then there's still shortage of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. 
So what's that doing? It's extending the time frame of how long it takes us to get product, and it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eightfold. The good news is, again, we're under contract. We bring in 15,000 containers a year. That's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace.
Now you move over to Specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some product in from the Far East. And we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And there, the real issue is the capacity of the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our Specialty group. We've said in the past quarters and this quarter was true as well. We've probably lost some revenue because we didn't have product on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor in what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors.
And Europe is somewhere in between, Bret. I mean, the reality is they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. But they're also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through."

Let me take that question. So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform -- If you go back when we initiated the 1 LKQ Europe program and formally gave margin targets, we basically call for exiting sustainable double-digit margins at the end of 2021. That was in September of 2019. Amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last 6 months of that 3-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times, with a pandemic thrown in for good measure, has been nothing short of phenomenal. We're really pleased with the team out there. As you, obviously, have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there at this point of time, very optimistic about the future also.
No, to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really. If you actually go back and see the European business historically and obviously take out 2020 because that was the pandemic year or at least and it's still continuing. But if you go back historically, Q1 and Q2 typically are strong. Q3 is also relatively strong, but in Q4 is typically seasonally the weakest for our European business. So it really is kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else as of now.
There obviously are a lot of flip flop measures taking place. Is the country open? Is the country not open? Yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows whether that continues or not. About 4 weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually. All of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland, with the exception of our U.K. leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there.
But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially what has led us to the first half performance, but also gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2% up to 10.3%, up by about 30 basis points to 9.5% to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business.
Let me kind of just, one final piece, also say these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag, but that is the way we've been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted includes at least in the first half, a 20 basis points drag. You can obviously take that away. And clearly, we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half."

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before I come back with a few closing remarks.
This was another quarter of significant operating progress, driven by excellent execution and improved business conditions. I could not be prouder of the LKQ team. A few years ago, when we pivoted to operational excellence, we knew that there would be a transition period during which we would need to invest in our people and processes to improve the operating model. We also recognize that there would be difficult decisions needed to rightsize the cost structure and drive efficiencies. 
We undertook this shift with the expectation that we would come out the other side as a leaner, more nimble and stronger organization, one that could succeed in difficult conditions like we have seen with the pandemic over the past year as well as thrive during the good times. Those expectations are being realized. While I'm not ready to proclaim mission accomplished, I believe we have made tremendous progress in our operational excellence transition as evidenced by the continued outstanding results that we've delivered over the past year.
Record outcomes don't happen by accident. And the team has driven strong profitability and cash flow by, among other actions, applying a disciplined pricing approach; implementing permanent cost-saving actions, including closing underperforming locations, consolidating delivery routes and reducing headcount; tightening our operating policies to reduce waste and increase yield, such as harvesting more catalytic converters per car; actively engaging with our vendor partners to ensure that we are receiving attractive pricing and market payment terms; and monitoring our receivables, so that we minimize past due balances.
Now on to the quarter. We were able to produce yet another record quarter. Indeed, each of the last 4 quarters' results represents the highest earnings per share reported in the respective quarters, with Q2 of 2021 reflecting the first quarter with over $1 of earnings per share and the highest segment EBITDA margins in over a decade. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 31% as compared to the $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 22%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 0.3%, and foreign exchange rates increased revenue 5.4%. This creates a total parts and services revenue increase of 27%. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the pandemic impact during Q2 of 2020.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $305 million as compared to $119 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 157%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.01 as compared to $0.39 for the same period last year, an increase of 159%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the second quarter was $340 million compared to $161 million in the same period of 2020, a 111% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.13 as compared to $0.53 for the same period of 2020, a 113% increase.
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 of our presentation sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter. And as you can see, coming off the low base of the second quarter of 2020, the growth rates improved significantly year-over-year for each of the segments, with April and May being the most notable.
The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets is encouraging. Europe, in particular, witnessed a solid increase in vaccinations throughout the second quarter, although it still lags the United States. We, like many, are closely monitoring the Delta variant and the risk of policy actions potentially slowing economic growth if the variant were to rapidly spread. 
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the second quarter was 28% above the prior year and 5% below the second quarter of 2019.
From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 19.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims data in the quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the second quarter of 2019. During Q2, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 9% on a per day basis relative to 2019, while repairable claims declined 15%, so another period of outperformance for our North American operations.
I want to highlight a couple of examples of how the North American team continues to push the operational excellence initiatives. In 2019, our North American team initiated a lean operating strategy based on the principle of doing more with less. During the first step of this strategy, the team asked the simple question, what does winning look like? The answers to that question allowed the team to unify and develop several key performance indicators that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic, and we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy, which is systematically implementing a lean road map to optimize those KPIs. We are transitioning the team to a daily management system, which addresses safety, quality, delivery and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions, along with sustainable sharing of best practices.
In Q2, our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize the procurement of the salvage vehicles we've bid on at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images to assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. Additionally, during the quarter, our Elitek business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming.
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis and 19.2% on a same-day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our U.K. business had the strongest recovery, largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition, and we are confident we are gaining share in the U.K. market. I am also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic. But it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment.
As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7% in the second quarter of 2021. In reality, there have been 2 distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized pan-European leadership team and functional structure. The other is execution-related, which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects.
Over the past 2 years, we have been working both components simultaneously, and I'm happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats and a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come.
A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July, we began onboarding the first group of about 25 employees for our innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland. The 4 CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track, and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022. And our ERP implementation at Rhiag in Italy went live on July 5.
Some of you may have noted that on July 14, the European Commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates in details plans for a greener economy and reducing net emissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. As a leader in the circular economy and the largest vehicle and parts recycler worldwide, LKQ embraces the global effort to reduce CO2 emissions.
Our European segment and also Mekonomen, where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. According to ACEA, the manufacturing -- automobile manufacturing association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not the sole and rational way forward. And internal combustion engines, including hybrids, need to play a role in the transition to zero emissions.
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which, again, knocked the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continue to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling cost. We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the Specialty business in the quarter.
Across all of our segments, we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which, in turn, is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by our margin performance.
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract.
From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. Also in Q2, Warn acquired Fabtech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. Fabtech brands, which include Dirt Logic and Stealth Shocks, are widely recognized premium offerings in the off-road racing and performance segments, and they're a tremendous complement to our line of Warn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car park and to leverage our robust networks across all segments to sell deeper into existing and prospective customers.
Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past 2 years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group.
Also, earlier this month, ISS significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter.
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who'll run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance."

Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operatio",1761,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation move towards targeting investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities.
I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures, and getting the validation of an investment-grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow, which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA.
As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1x net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2x as of June of 2021. Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly 35% below the current share price.
We have not sacrificed investments in the business during this period, with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution, acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tuck-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last 3 years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter.
First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the EUR 0.75 billion 2026 euro notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date, with funds from our lower-cost revolver as well as cash on hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again, using funds from the revolver and cash on hand. And we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date.
With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by this smaller facility, so we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further.
We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value, and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to purchase shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July, with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. Since we were nearing our $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October of 2024.
Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more noteworthy as it came in a period in which input cost rose across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in our pricing, and as a distributor, we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain.
Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year.
While we started to annualize some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth, dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to operating performance.
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters, as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving cost out of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $25 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage I mentioned earlier are seen here, helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation.
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With the year-to-date margin at 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing and cost containment actions taken in the last year.
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014.
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation of full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25%, which had a nominal benefit on the quarter.
So to recap. Our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.60 increase from Q2 of 2020, which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefits along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs, and this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results.
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels, and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year.
Number one, we believe that our parts and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full year basis, and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments, in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rates to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter, as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business.
While we expect demand for our Specialty products will remain strong, we anticipate the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. As discussed previously, we will have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter. While Europe is flat for the year overall, with 1 day shifting from Q1 into Q2.
Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with a midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2 in addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year, as we expect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment to outweigh strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry.
And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we've made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to $1.050 billion, with $1 billion at the midpoint.
We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. In the interim, our teams, with the active support of the vendor partners, continue to expertly navigate the situation to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. 
And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow.
Thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Yes, incredibly pleased with the company really firing on all cylinders across revenue, margin, but also free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it.
With regards to your specific question about the recent investment-grade rating initiation by Fitch, in itself, it makes no change to either our credit facility or, for that matter, vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece, we have a prewired clause, which essentially states that if 1 of the 2 currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us an investment-grade rating, the liens of our senior secured facility drop off. And that, as you can imagine, is a significant number, which, of course, is this $3.5 billion credit facility. So that's one piece where the liens drop off and it becomes unsecured.
The second piece is, within the credit facility, we have a current ceiling that our indebtedness to -- for trade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change anything today, but clearly, being 1 of the 3 key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us. I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other 2 rating agencies, they, too, will come around. I don't believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when."

What our field teams have done globally from a branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ success is directly attributable to our field teams. The last 17, 18 months have not been easy, but they are the ones that have kept this company humming along and really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter.
Yes, you're right. With regards to our North America margins, at 20.8% in the current quarter or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been. As I've been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently in my prepared comments, precious metals have been a benefit, and we estimate -- and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading and really what level of benefit has come through. We estimate roughly 350 basis points of the 20.8% margin that North America has put up is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices.
Even if you were to take a piece out, the business has still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort. Could we have done better? Perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures. I say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor. And labor essentially, whether it be availability or whether it be the cost to get that labor, it is leading to congestions at ports, it's leading to higher freight costs because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find, but that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle in terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams.
We have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up also just to make sure that we are market competitive. But we have got branch managers, plant managers, DMs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business. And just want to make sure that that is heard loud and clear, our field folks have done an outstanding job."

Second would be freight. And that not only relates to ocean freight, which is up significantly, but also the domestic freight, whether it be in the U.S. or in Europe. And then some people put fuel as part of freight. We try and separate it out. Obviously, if you can track oil prices, they've been up as well.
I'd point you to Page 7 of our deck, which kind of sorts out where we have saved money over the past year or so.

Obviously, the focus currently is on kind of newer technologies, right? So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year in the whole diagnostics and calibration space, and we're building up a very nice business there.
As you know, and we mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2 that relates to battery technologies. And again, we all know that ultimately, battery -- being able to service and deal with the EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important, so you should expect additional investment in that area.
So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set, and the services is a key component there, relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller. Because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy. So we can, again, make sure that we are on the cutting edge as it relates to what we can provide our customers."

The biggest uplift really will be from our European business. And just given the nature of the European business and how we compare that from a payables optimization program relative to say the big 4 here on the hard parts site in North America. Our North American business per se, we have some opportunity. But if you think of the salvage business, whether self-serve or full-serve, it's just a different business model, right?
So if you think about the size and scale of our European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is. And we certainly see that there's further upside out there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment-grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180-day ceiling obviously gets lifted. That's more of a tactical piece. But more an ongoing basis, as the team, how that continues, it's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners. The focus really had been, let's get through the top 40, and then the team continues to go further down the chain as part of the overall supplier rationalization discussions, making sure that we continue to get COGS at attractive prices, but also at what we believe to be market convention terms."

Obviously, the supply chain, not just in our industry, but in most industries, is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends on actually the business and the product line because there's significant differences across the LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact because all that product is here, and it's easy for us to get at the auctions.
Our aftermarket business here, however, most of the aftermarket collision product for the whole industry, not just us, comes out of Taiwan. And it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product. The manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka or wherever we need them here in the U.S. And everyone knows what's going on, the issues related to container capacity. Port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the drayage within the ports. That means you're moving the cans around. And then there's still shortage of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. 
So what's that doing? It's extending the time frame of how long it takes us to get product, and it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eightfold. The good news is, again, we're under contract. We bring in 15,000 containers a year. That's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace.
Now you move over to Specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some product in from the Far East. And we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And there, the real issue is the capacity of the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our Specialty group. We've said in the past quarters and this quarter was true as well. We've probably lost some revenue because we didn't have product on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor in what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors.
And Europe is somewhere in between, Bret. I mean, the reality is they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. But they're also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through."

So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform.  If you go back when we initiated the 1 LKQ Europe program and formally gave margin targets, we basically called for exiting sustainable double-digit margins at the end of 2021. That was in September of 2019. Amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last 6 months of that 3-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times, with a pandemic thrown in for good measure, has been nothing short of phenomenal. We're really pleased with the team out there. As you, obviously, have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there at this point of time, very optimistic about the future also.
Moving to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really. If you actually go back and see the European business historically and obviously take out 2020 because that was the pandemic year or at least and it's still continuing. But if you go back historically, Q1 and Q2 typically are strong. Q3 is also relatively strong, but then Q4 is typically seasonally the weakest for our European business. So it really is kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else as of now.
There obviously are a lot of flip flop measures taking place. Is the country open? Is the country not open? Yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows whether that continues or not. About 4 weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually. All of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland, with the exception of our U.K. leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there.
But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially what has led us to the first half performance, but also gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2% up to 10.3%, up by about 30 basis points to 9.5% to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business.
Let me kind of just -- one final piece, also say these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag, but that is the way we've been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted includes at least in the first half, a 20 basis points drag. You can obviously take that away. And clearly, we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half."

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before",2034,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before I come back with a few closing remarks.
This was another quarter of significant operating progress, driven by excellent execution and improved business conditions. I could not be prouder of the LKQ team. A few years ago, when we pivoted to operational excellence, we knew that there would be a transition period during which we would need to invest in our people and processes to improve the operating model. We also recognize that there would be difficult decisions needed to rightsize the cost structure and drive efficiencies. 
We undertook this shift with the expectation that we would come out the other side as a leaner, more nimble and stronger organization, one that could succeed in difficult conditions like we have seen with the pandemic over the past year as well as thrive during the good times. Those expectations are being realized. While I'm not ready to proclaim mission accomplished, I believe we have made tremendous progress in our operational excellence transition as evidenced by the continued outstanding results that we've delivered over the past year.
Record outcomes don't happen by accident. And the team has driven strong profitability and cash flow by, among other actions, applying a disciplined pricing approach; implementing permanent cost-saving actions, including closing underperforming locations, consolidating delivery routes and reducing headcount; tightening our operating policies to reduce waste and increase yield, such as harvesting more catalytic converters per car; actively engaging with our vendor partners to ensure that we are receiving attractive pricing and market payment terms; and monitoring our receivables, so that we minimize past due balances.
Now on to the quarter. We were able to produce yet another record quarter. Indeed, each of the last 4 quarters' results represents the highest earnings per share reported in the respective quarters, with Q2 of 2021 reflecting the first quarter with over $1 of earnings per share and the highest segment EBITDA margins in over a decade. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 31% as compared to the $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 22%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 0.3%, and foreign exchange rates increased revenue 5.4%. This creates a total parts and services revenue increase of 27%. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the pandemic impact during Q2 of 2020.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $305 million as compared to $119 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of 157%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.01 as compared to $0.39 for the same period last year, an increase of 159%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the second quarter was $340 million compared to $161 million in the same period of 2020, a 111% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.13 as compared to $0.53 for the same period of 2020, a 113% increase.
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 of our presentation sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter. And as you can see, coming off the low base of the second quarter of 2020, the growth rates improved significantly year-over-year for each of the segments, with April and May being the most notable.
The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets is encouraging. Europe, in particular, witnessed a solid increase in vaccinations throughout the second quarter, although it still lags the United States. We, like many, are closely monitoring the Delta variant and the risk of policy actions potentially slowing economic growth if the variant were to rapidly spread. 
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the second quarter was 28% above the prior year and 5% below the second quarter of 2019.
From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 19.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims data in the quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the second quarter of 2019. During Q2, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 9% on a per day basis relative to 2019, while repairable claims declined 15%, so another period of outperformance for our North American operations.
I want to highlight a couple of examples of how the North American team continues to push the operational excellence initiatives. In 2019, our North American team initiated a lean operating strategy based on the principle of doing more with less. During the first step of this strategy, the team asked the simple question, what does winning look like? The answers to that question allowed the team to unify and develop several key performance indicators that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic, and we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy, which is systematically implementing a lean road map to optimize those KPIs. We are transitioning the team to a daily management system, which addresses safety, quality, delivery and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions, along with sustainable sharing of best practices.
In Q2, our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize the procurement of the salvage vehicles we've bid on at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images to assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. Additionally, during the quarter, our Elitek business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming.
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis and 19.2% on a same-day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our U.K. business had the strongest recovery, largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition, and we are confident we are gaining share in the U.K. market. I am also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic. But it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment.
As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7% in the second quarter of 2021. In reality, there have been 2 distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized pan-European leadership team and functional structure. The other is execution-related, which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects.
Over the past 2 years, we have been working both components simultaneously, and I'm happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats and a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come.
A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July, we began onboarding the first group of about 25 employees for our innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland. The 4 CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track, and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022. And our ERP implementation at Rhiag in Italy went live on July 5.
Some of you may have noted that on July 14, the European Commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates in details plans for a greener economy and reducing net emissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. As a leader in the circular economy and the largest vehicle and parts recycler worldwide, LKQ embraces the global effort to reduce CO2 emissions.
Our European segment and also Mekonomen, where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. According to ACEA, the manufacturing -- automobile manufacturing association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not the sole and rational way forward. And internal combustion engines, including hybrids, need to play a role in the transition to zero emissions.
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which, again, knocked the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continue to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling cost. We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the Specialty business in the quarter.
Across all of our segments, we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which, in turn, is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by our margin performance.
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract.
From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. Also in Q2, Warn acquired Fabtech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. Fabtech brands, which include Dirt Logic and Stealth Shocks, are widely recognized premium offerings in the off-road racing and performance segments, and they're a tremendous complement to our line of Warn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car park and to leverage our robust networks across all segments to sell deeper into existing and prospective customers.
Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past 2 years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group.
Also, earlier this month, ISS significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter.
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who'll run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance."

Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operatio",1761,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation move towards targeting investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities.
I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures, and getting the validation of an investment-grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow, which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA.
As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1x net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2x as of June of 2021. Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly 35% below the current share price.
We have not sacrificed investments in the business during this period, with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution, acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tuck-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last 3 years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter.
First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the EUR 0.75 billion 2026 euro notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date, with funds from our lower-cost revolver as well as cash on hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again, using funds from the revolver and cash on hand. And we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date.
With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by this smaller facility, so we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further.
We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value, and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to purchase shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July, with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. Since we were nearing our $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October of 2024.
Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more noteworthy as it came in a period in which input cost rose across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in our pricing, and as a distributor, we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain.
Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year.
While we started to annualize some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth, dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to operating performance.
I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters, as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving cost out of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $25 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage I mentioned earlier are seen here, helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation.
As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With the year-to-date margin at 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing and cost containment actions taken in the last year.
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014.
We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation of full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25%, which had a nominal benefit on the quarter.
So to recap. Our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.60 increase from Q2 of 2020, which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefits along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs, and this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results.
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels, and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year.
Number one, we believe that our parts and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full year basis, and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments, in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rates to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter, as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business.
While we expect demand for our Specialty products will remain strong, we anticipate the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. As discussed previously, we will have 2 fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter. While Europe is flat for the year overall, with 1 day shifting from Q1 into Q2.
Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with a midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2 in addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year, as we expect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment to outweigh strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry.
And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we've made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to $1.050 billion, with $1 billion at the midpoint.
We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. In the interim, our teams, with the active support of the vendor partners, continue to expertly navigate the situation to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. 
And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow.
Thank you, once again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Yes, incredibly pleased with the company really firing on all cylinders across revenue, margin, but also free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it.
With regards to your specific question about the recent investment-grade rating initiation by Fitch, in itself, it makes no change to either our credit facility or, for that matter, vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece, we have a prewired clause, which essentially states that if 1 of the 2 currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us an investment-grade rating, the liens of our senior secured facility drop off. And that, as you can imagine, is a significant number, which, of course, is this $3.5 billion credit facility. So that's one piece where the liens drop off and it becomes unsecured.
The second piece is, within the credit facility, we have a current ceiling that our indebtedness to -- for trade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change anything today, but clearly, being 1 of the 3 key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us. I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other 2 rating agencies, they, too, will come around. I don't believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when."

Before I get to the specifics of answering your question, I just want to make sure that all of our 43-plus thousand associates globally are given a big shout out. What our field teams have done globally from a branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ success is directly attributable to our field teams. The last 17, 18 months have not been easy, but they are the ones that have kept this company humming along and really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter.
Yes, you're right. With regards to our North America margins, at 20.8% in the current quarter or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been. As I've been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently in my prepared comments, precious metals have been a benefit, and we estimate -- and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading and really what level of benefit has come through. We estimate roughly 350 basis points of the 20.8% margin that North America has put up is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices.
Even if you were to take a piece out, the business has still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort. Could we have done better? Perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures. I say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor. And labor essentially, whether it be availability or whether it be the cost to get that labor, it is leading to congestions at ports, it's leading to higher freight costs because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find, but that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle in terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams.
We have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up also just to make sure that we are market competitive. But we have got branch managers, plant managers, DMs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business. And just want to make sure that that is heard loud and clear, our field folks have done an outstanding job."

Second would be freight. And that not only relates to ocean freight, which is up significantly, but also the domestic freight, whether it be in the U.S. or in Europe. And then some people put fuel as part of freight. We try and separate it out. Obviously, if you can track oil prices, they've been up as well.
I'd point you to Page 7 of our deck, which kind of sorts out where we have saved money over the past year or so.

So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year in the whole diagnostics and calibration space, and we're building up a very nice business there.
As you know, and we mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2 that relates to battery technologies. And again, we all know that ultimately, battery -- being able to service and deal with the EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important, so you should expect additional investment in that area.
So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set, and the services is a key component there, relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller. Because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy. So we can, again, make sure that we are on the cutting edge as it relates to what we can provide our customers."

The biggest uplift really will be from our European business. And just given the nature of the European business and how we compare that from a payables optimization program relative to say the big 4 here on the hard parts site in North America. Our North American business per se, we have some opportunity. But if you think of the salvage business, whether self-serve or full-serve, it's just a different business model, right?
So if you think about the size and scale of our European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is. And we certainly see that there's further upside out there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment-grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180-day ceiling obviously gets lifted. That's more of a tactical piece. But more an ongoing basis, as the team, how that continues, it's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners. The focus really had been, let's get through the top 40, and then the team continues to go further down the chain as part of the overall supplier rationalization discussions, making sure that we continue to get COGS at attractive prices, but also at what we believe to be market convention terms."

Obviously, the supply chain, not just in our industry, but in most industries, is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends on actually the business and the product line because there's significant differences across the LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact because all that product is here, and it's easy for us to get at the auctions.
Our aftermarket business here, however, most of the aftermarket collision product for the whole industry, not just us, comes out of Taiwan. And it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product. The manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka or wherever we need them here in the U.S. And everyone knows what's going on, the issues related to container capacity. Port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the drayage within the ports. That means you're moving the cans around. And then there's still shortage of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. 
So what's that doing? It's extending the time frame of how long it takes us to get product, and it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eightfold. The good news is, again, we're under contract. We bring in 15,000 containers a year. That's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace.
Now you move over to Specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some product in from the Far East. And we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And there, the real issue is the capacity of the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our Specialty group. We've said in the past quarters and this quarter was true as well. We've probably lost some revenue because we didn't have product on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor in what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors.
And Europe is somewhere in between, Bret. I mean, the reality is they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. But they're also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through."

So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform.  If you go back when we initiated the 1 LKQ Europe program and formally gave margin targets, we basically called for exiting sustainable double-digit margins at the end of 2021. That was in September of 2019. Amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last 6 months of that 3-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times, with a pandemic thrown in for good measure, has been nothing short of phenomenal. We're really pleased with the team out there. As you, obviously, have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there at this point of time, very optimistic about the future also.
Moving to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really. If you actually go back and see the European business historically and obviously take out 2020 because that was the pandemic year or at least and it's still continuing. But if you go back historically, Q1 and Q2 typically are strong. Q3 is also relatively strong, but then Q4 is typically seasonally the weakest for our European business. So it really is kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else as of now.
There obviously are a lot of flip flop measures taking place. Is the country open? Is the country not open? Yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows whether that continues or not. About 4 weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually. All of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland, with the exception of our U.K. leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there.
But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially what has led us to the first half performance, but also gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2% up to 10.3%, up by about 30 basis points to 9.5% to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business.
Let me kind of just -- one final piece, also say these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag, but that is the way we've been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted includes at least in the first half, a 20 basis points drag. You can obviously take that away. And clearly, we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half."

This was another quarter of significant operating progress at LKQ driven by excellent execution in delivering solid financial performance, all while navigating the challenges with the supply chain and the current cost environment. 
We were able to produce yet another record quarter, and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with the highest EPS reported in their respective quarters. The third quarter also reflects the second time we've been able to achieve more than $1 of earnings per share on an adjusted basis and reflects the highest third quarter segment EBITDA margin in the history of the company. 
We are particularly pleased that our European business delivered its highest segment EBITDA level in over 9 years, exceeding the 11% level. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly. 
While I recognize the listeners are primarily focused on the financial results, I know our performance is a reflection of the dedication and effort of our 45,000 team members around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers. I hope you can appreciate that I am more excited about the performance of my team than the quarterly results as they are the key to continued excellence. 
With respect to capital allocation, as you hopefully read from our press release issued this morning, I am very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has declared the company's first ever quarterly cash dividend. This dividend declaration and our existing stock repurchase program are key components of our strategic plan to drive total long-term returns for our stockholders. Our solid balance sheet and sustainable cash flow generation, coupled with our leading market positions across our operating segments, provide us with the opportunity to execute on that plan. The quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on December 2, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 11. 
Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 8.2% as compared to the $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020. 
During the third quarter, total parts and services revenue increased 6%, comprising organic growth of 4%, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increasing revenue by 0.5% and foreign exchange rates increasing revenue by 1.5%. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $284 million as compared to $194 million for the same period last year, an increase of 46.4%. 
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.96 a share as compared to $0.64 a share for the same period of 2020, an increase of 50%. 
On an adjusted basis, net income in the third quarter was $300 million compared to $228 million in the same period of 2020, a 31.6% increase. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.02 as compared to $0.75 for the same period of 2020, a 36% increase. 
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the revenue trends for the quarter, and you can see growth rates improved year-over-year for all segments. The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets continued to improve, but as we progressed throughout the quarter, we started to face headwinds related to the rise in the Delta variant and also challenges with the aftermarket supply chain, both of which impacted organic growth across each of the segments. 
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the third quarter was 8.6% above the prior year and 1.3% below the third quarter of 2019. 
From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 5.9% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims this quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the third quarter of 2019. 
During Q3, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 7% on a per-day basis relative to 2019 levels, while repairable claims declined 10.6%. So it was another period of outperformance for our North American operations. 
During the third quarter, our salvage business and the growth of our major mechanical product groups had solid performance. Although fill rates have been challenged, we are witnessing a positive offset from our quote conversion rates on salvage parts. Importantly, as we progressed through the third quarter and entered Q4, we've witnessed an increase in availability of the auctions, and prices are moderating versus what we experienced earlier in the year. 
Also, Elitek, our diagnostic and calibration services business, continued to exceed our expectations, with September being the highest monthly level of diagnostic scans since building out this business, a clear sign that shops and carriers are embracing this unique service offering. 
For those on the call that will be attending the SEMA event next week, Elitek will have a presence at the show. So please come visit, and you can see why we are excited about this growth opportunity. 
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter increased 0.1% on a reported basis and 0.3% on a per day basis. 
When compared to the third quarter of 2019, our European revenue was down just 1% on a per-day basis. So we have made progress on getting back to pre-pandemic levels and are optimistic we will move ahead of the 2019 levels in the next quarter or 2. 
From an overall mobility perspective, virtually every European market experienced flat growth in the quarter, which we believe is a sign that the spike we witnessed in the second quarter due to the reopening of the economy subsided sequentially in Q3. 
Our regional operations continue to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter. Our Eastern European business had the strongest recovery despite a very competitive pricing environment. Germany and the Benelux markets also delivered well above total segment growth. The drag in growth was primarily driven by negative growth in Italy, a market that continues to face very difficult conditions. 
Other items to note in Europe would include the fact that on September 6 we celebrated the grand opening of our new innovation and service center in Katowice, Poland that began operations earlier in the quarter. Also, on October 1, just after the close of the third quarter, we acquired a company named Hamu, which operates 9 locations in the Central Netherlands region. With over 100 employees, Hamu is one of the largest independent automotive parts wholesalers in the Netherlands. 
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which again delivered solid performance during the third quarter by reporting organic revenue growth on a same-day basis of 13.7%. As witnessed in the first half of the year, the drivers of this ongoing performance continued to be strong demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks as well as our drop-ship business. 
On October 1, we finalized the acquisition of SeaWide Marine distribution, a nationwide electronics wholesale distributor that supplies electrical and electronic products for the marine, outdoor and personal navigation markets. This acquisition is consistent with the strategy of entering adjacent markets that Bill Rogers highlighted during our 2020 Investor Day. 
Marine products overlapped nicely with our RV and towing product portfolio. Importantly, SeaWide now has the benefit of leveraging our network of 8 specialty distribution centers in over 40 cross-docks that are strategically located to provide next-day service throughout North America. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the total addressable market for the wholesale product SeaWide offers is over $3 billion. 
Lastly, I want to acknowledge and congratulate the Specialty team for being recognized as the RV Industry Association Distributor of the Year at the recent 2021 RV Aftermarket Conference in Atlanta, a tremendous accomplishment. 
In addition to the Hamu and Seawide Marine acquisitions, other corporate development transactions included divesting all of our equity interest in a very small joint venture in the U.K.  and acquiring a business in the United States that remanufactures torque converters, a product used in the remanufacturing of automatic transmissions. 
The global supply chain continues to be under duress. It is widely known that, today, a record number of ships are anchored off the coast of California waiting for port lanes to unload containers, some of which hold our aftermarket inventory and are eventually headed to LKQ facilities. 
High demand for oversea products, congestions within the ports and at the rail hubs and a severe shortage of truck drivers has led to delays and increased cost for ocean and land freight, both in North America and in Europe. The recent initiatives across the globe to begin tackling components of these route issues, such as the measures implemented by the Port of Los Angeles on October 12, are encouraging. But we expect overarching supply chain issues to persist in the near to midterm. We are doing our best to effectively navigate the difficult environment, and we are hopeful that we won't be talking about the supply chain challenges and reading draconian headlines on a daily basis at this time next year. 
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and to help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. 
Now a brief update on some of our ongoing ESG efforts. During the quarter, we established the LKQ Cares ESG Advisory Committee, which is comprised of key leaders across our company. The purpose of the committee is to support and provide advice regarding LKQ Corporation's ongoing commitment to environmental matters, social responsibility, corporate governance and many other public policies relevant to our company. 
Additionally, with inclusion being a core value at LKQ, I am excited to announce that LKQ has joined the Second Chance Business Coalition, a nationwide effort to create economic opportunity for approximately 78 million Americans trying to get back on their feet and contribute to society. We are proud to be alongside 35 other large public and private companies that also believe that supporting those seeking a second chance in life not only provides opportunities for the individual but also for their families and for their communities. It's simply the right thing to do. 
Lastly, as you may have read, we are both humbled and honored that LKQ North America has been recognized by WorkBuzz, an independent, global employee engagement firm as a 5-star employer after receiving positive feedback from our first-ever employee engagement survey. Part of our mission statement is to build strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. And this award validates that our inclusive and engaged teams are proudly carrying this mission forward. 
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong third quarter financial performance."
4303924,1684611545,2415435,"LKQ Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued evidence of the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives we instituted a few years ago. Record profitability and continued robust free",1982,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued evidence of the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives we instituted a few years ago. 
Record profitability and continued robust free cash flow just don't happen by accident. The team's focus on getting the fundamentals right, continuous improvement and winning each day has driven these strong results under what are incredibly challenging conditions, with a congested supply chain and strong inflationary pressures. 
I'd like to start with a few highlights before getting into the details. As you heard from Nick, Europe achieved segment EBITDA of 11.5% for the quarter. This gives us the confidence to narrow the full year segment EBITDA range for 2021 further to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively lifting the floor by a further 30 basis points. 
Specialty delivered yet another excellent organic revenue quarter at 13.7% despite the ongoing supply chain challenges. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of robust double-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. 
Cash flow generation remains strong. And the conversion ratio relative to earnings continues to be above our long-term expectation despite a challenging environment. 
The share repurchase program carried on with a further 4.3 million shares purchased in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 12 million shares and the program to date of [ 29.3 shares ] repurchased. 
And finally, the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend reflects the confidence in our strategy and the strength of our business, underscoring our commitment to deliver long-term value to our stockholders. 
Now I'll move to the consolidated financial results. As Nick described, Q3 was another successful quarter with growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, cash flow and earnings per share. 
Gross margin was again a highlight for the quarter, increasing 150 basis points relative to the prior year. We continue to feel pressure on input costs across each of our segments, but we have been able to mitigate the effects by being nimble to adjust to the new reality of higher input costs by adjusting pricing. Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices, although at a much lower level than we've seen in prior quarters. 
Car costs remain relatively high. And with the moderation of precious metal prices in the quarter as seen on Slide 27, the benefit dipped relative to the first half of the year. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $12 million in segment EBITDA and $0.03 in adjusted EPS relative to last year. As a reminder, this benefit is well below the $57 million in segment EBITDA and $0.14 in adjusted EPS from metal prices experienced in the second quarter of 2021. 
Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points year-over-year largely driven by personnel costs. The tight labor market has pushed wages higher in many of our markets. Additionally, strong performance across all 3 segments is contributing to increased levels of incentive compensation in 2021, which represents 30 basis points of higher expense. Other overhead expenses are slightly favorable, as we're offsetting inflation in freight and fuel through operating efficiencies and leverage from higher scrap and core revenue. 
I'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced an EBITDA margin of 17.3% for the quarter, down 30 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin was favorable by 60 basis points, primarily coming out of the ongoing margin initiatives in the wholesale business and improved pricing. Self-service increased gross margin dollars compared to 2020 but generated a lower margin percentage due to an increase in car cost and moderating metal prices. Segment overhead expenses increased by 100 basis points, with the largest change owing to personnel expenses. Roughly half of the increase is attributable to wages and temporary labor, with the remainder in higher incentive compensation. At the segment EBITDA line, the metals prices benefit noted previously generated 20 basis points of improvement relative to last year. 
I previously mentioned Europe's strong margin for the quarter, and Slide 11 shows the details. Adjusted gross margin increased by 240 basis points to the highest level in recent years, primarily owing to better net pricing. While overhead expenses grew by 30 basis points, driven by higher wages and incentive compensation. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty grew EBITDA dollars though experienced 100 basis points of dilution in margin. The primary factors contributing to the decrease are: one, higher incentive compensation; inflationary pressures in the segment's 1 operations, which are behind the 30 basis point decrease in gross margin; and finally, duplicative costs associated with acquisitions done in the current fiscal year, which we expect to be transitory as the team integrates the acquired businesses over the remainder of the year and into early 2022. 
Similar to the first half of 2021, we are also delivering benefits from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes in April of this year created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added roughly $0.06 per share to our third quarter results, and based on the characteristics of these initiatives are expected to continue to deliver over multiple periods. Additionally, income from our equity method and other investments generated a further $0.02 of year-over-year growth. 
Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.25% to 25.75%, which contributed to a $0.04 per share year-over-year benefit in the third quarter. 
So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $1.02 is a $0.27 increase over the third quarter of 2020. The commodity benefits, as previously stated, were $0.03; investments generated a further $0.02; the tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.10 of the improvement. The remaining $0.12 comes from our operating performance, by far the single largest contributor to the results. 
Shifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We continued the trend of robust cash flow generation in the third quarter with $429 million of operating cash flow and $384 million of free cash flow. Our conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow was a very strong 84%, roughly in line with our year-to-date ratio, as seen on Slide 14. Our operating cash flows were driven by cash earnings and favorable movement in trade working capital balances. 
Payables represented an inflow for the quarter as we benefit from extended payment terms, including our European vendor financing initiative. 
Inventory was an outflow of $60 million for the quarter. But similar to the second quarter, we were unable to increase our purchasing to the designed level owing to the supply chain issues that are affecting many sectors of the economy. We are actively working to rebuild inventory levels, and we believe that our excellent relationships with suppliers and liquidity on hand puts us in a good position to acquire the needed inventory when supply chain congestion finally eases. 
We deployed the free cash flow to repurchase 4.3 million shares in the quarter for $219 million, acquired 2 tuck-in businesses for $37 million and repaid $23 million in outstanding borrowings. Our net leverage ratio dropped to 1.1x EBITDA, and interest coverage now exceeds 24x, compared to the credit facility requirements of 4.25x and 3x, respectively. Or said differently, at this point in time, we do not need to devote further capital towards paying debt, and as you saw in the third quarter results also.  
With $1.6 billion in availability on our credit facility and approximately $400 million in cash, we have over $2 billion in liquidity to fund our strategic objectives. The liquidity amount is roughly $800 million below our December 31, 2020 figure, reflecting the use of liquidity to redeem the 2026 EUR 0.75 billion euro notes, prepay our outstanding term loan balance of $319 million as well as the termination of the $110 million receivable securitization program earlier this year in July. We felt comfortable reducing the overall capacity owing to our ability to sustainably generate robust free cash flow. 
As you can imagine, we have carefully considered our liquidity position and future cash flow generation prospects in reaching the decision to initiate the quarterly cash dividend. We are confident in the company's ability to convert earnings to free cash flow in a ratio of 55% to 60% on a long-term basis, which provides us with sufficient cash to fund a dividend while continuing to repurchase shares, reinvest in the business and make accretive acquisitions. 
Initiating a dividend is an important milestone in the company's history and reflects the Board and the management team's confidence in our near- and long-term prospects. The decision to pay a dividend is consistent with, and does not change, our approach to capital allocation, which prioritizes growth investments and return excess cash to shareholders to enhance their returns. Our share repurchase program will run in tandem with the dividend program as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on the full year 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which that assume that there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets or foreign exchange rates and scrap and precious metal prices hold near recent levels in the remainder of the year. 
The first statement being, with yet another excellent quarter in Q3, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.78 to $3.88 with a midpoint of $3.83. This is an increase of $0.18 or 5% at the midpoint over our prior quarter guidance and an increase of $1.08 or 39% relative to our original 2021 full year guidance. The increases reflect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment, which have allowed us to mitigate strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs prevalent throughout the industry. 
While we expect our operational performance in Q4 to play out roughly in line with prior guidance, we are projecting a negative impact of roughly $0.02 a share, resulting from metal prices as these move lower going into the fourth quarter. As you think about the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020, we are forecasting a $0.07 per share negative year-over-year effect related to sequential movements in metal prices. Additionally, having 1 fewer selling day in the North America and Specialty segments in the fourth quarter of 2021 creates a further $0.02 headwind. A lower share count and tax rate in 2021 should mitigate some of the year-over-year headwinds. 
The second statement I would like to share with everyone is we are narrowing the range for full year European segment EBITDA margin to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively raising the floor by a further 30 basis points, similar to what we did roughly 90 days ago following the second quarter earnings. 
And finally, we continue to generate outstanding free cash flow through strong profitability and judicious use of [ trade ] working capital. With this in mind, along with higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion, with $1.225 billion at the midpoint. 
Despite the supply chain challenges, we still anticipate an inventory increase in the fourth quarter, ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand, although not to the level assumed in prior guidance, as a portion of the build will likely be deferred into 2022. 
With that, thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

And I will tell you that our Elitek margins are well ahead of our parts distribution margins, and it requires relatively little capital. So the return on invested capital is very attractive, very attractive. 
Again, this is still a relatively small business for us, kind of in and around that $50 million range. But our goal is to grow it very, very rapidly, not by orders of 5% or 10% a year, but our goal would be to multiply the size of the business over the next several years.

And it's not just an issue with the ports. The reality is there's a lot of data out there that's showing that there's just not enough truckers turning up to get the containers out of the ports. There's a severe shortage of drivers. Most folks estimate this country is down about 80,000 truck drivers. The warehouses, where the containers ultimately need to go, are clogged. And importantly, containers get put on a chassis, which is then connected to the tractor of the semi-tractor combination, there's a severe shortage of chassis available. 
So the supply chain is a bit of a mess completely. And so yes, it's taking much longer for us to get our product, say from Taiwan into the United States. It's costing us some more money. It's important to recognize that the inventory is ours when it hits the port in Taiwan. So that's our inventory, not the supplier's inventory, sitting out on the water. And so we're being very thoughtful as to putting in advance orders, making sure we can do whatever we can to get the inventory that we need. 
The bad news is we're not -- we don't have the inventory levels that we prefer. The good news is we think we're doing significantly better than our small competitors. I mean think about it, we bring in 16,000 containers a year, that's about 300 a week, from the Far East for our North American aftermarket parts business. Our small competitors, they'd be lucky if they bring in 300 a year or even 50 a year. So we feel we're -- from a fulfillment rate basis, we're doing much better than the small competitors. And we know that because there have been a few smaller folks basically waving the white flag and asking if we'd be interested in buying their business. 
So again, it's going to be a challenge going forward. We think we're doing a pretty effective job of managing our way through that challenge."

Within the industry but also among broader companies, having a lower cost back office to do commoditized transaction processing, but also, in the case of Poland, we believe there is some good digital and technology talent. And that really is the background to what we're trying to do from a Katowice perspective. 
As you know, we obviously have Bangalore and now putting up another center certainly gives us the geographic breadth, language capabilities, not just to do some of the more, I'd say, regularly expected back office activities, but also to invest in things such as digital. We clearly know that while B2B and the different market, the do-it-for-me market, is clearly the biggest piece of it in Europe, but there is some adjacency associated with B2C. And being able to do some of that back office work and the technology work out of Katowice in Poland, which does have talent, we believe there is some goodness associated with it.

Let me take that one. So yes, within -- in the third quarter, as I called out, the total metals benefit, both scrap and catalytic inverter, so precious metals, was about $12 million or roughly about $0.03 within the $1.02 of adjusted EPS. Relative to what we experienced in the first half of the year, if you recall, in Q1, it was a $34 million upside, in Q2 was roughly $57 million, so significant upside. 
But really, what we saw come through was starting in September, we saw scrap metal prices, but also more to the point, precious metal prices, began to drop pretty significantly. And so that piece, despite the fact that those metal prices were dropping, car costs remained relatively high. And so the overall metals benefit was muted. 
And really what we've seen exiting September, as we've shown on Slide #27 also for the benefit of everybody, you see that bigger slide begin to take place in September. And so from a Q4 forecast perspective, we are actually, as of now, anticipating that to be a negative impact from metals pricing rather than an ongoing benefit. 
So if you think about the first half versus the second half, in the first half, we said we pretty much got close to, I'd say, $90 million of EBITDA from metals, be it precious or scrap. In the third quarter, it was about 12%, which kind of gives you a year-to-date of about $103 million. And in the fourth quarter, we see an unwind of anything up to $30 million taking place. So that's how you should think about it. Clearly, it's a volatile market as of now, things are changing on a daily, weekly basis, but that's how we think about the metals pricing, which underpins our forecast that we've provided."

Obviously, the aftermarket part availability is constrained a bit because of all the supply chain challenges we've already talked about. Salvage parts come from the local markets, right? We buy total lost vehicles locally, we dismantle them locally and then we can distribute on a local basis. And there absolutely has been a bit of a shift. And I would say this primarily benefits us relative to anybody else because we are the only company that can offer both salvage and recycled product and the aftermarket collision parts. And so we have absolutely seen our -- the growth in our salvage business in the quarter and actually for the last few quarters has been well above the growth and the revenue trends in the aftermarket product. And part of that is due to the strong mechanical business, engines and transmissions, that we talked about in our formal comments. And part of it is this ability to, in certain times, shift the customer from an aftermarket product that we may not have an inventory to a salvage product that we can get to them same day or next day. So the salvage business has been very good. And again, we're the only company in this country that offers both product lines."

No, broadly, we are we're maybe in the top of the first [indiscernible] in the whole EV marketplace and the transition and the like. So there are no big trends. There are no shifts. 
What we will tell you is that when you look at hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, technical service parts command anywhere from a 2x to 6x premium relative to their comparable internal combustion engine counterparts. And there's a number of reasons for that. One is the technical complexity, not just with batteries, but also with the electrification of components previously belt-driven such as air conditioning, compressors and water pumps. 
For an example, this is just one example. A 2013 Prius with an electric water pump, that water pump sells for 3x the value of a 2013 Corolla that has a belt-driven water pump. In the U.K., for example, a 2017 Golf with an internal combustion engine, that water pump sells for about GBP 77. The Lexus hybrid EV, the water pump is GBP 278. 
And so yes, the EV parts are much more expensive. We think that's going to continue to be the case for a long, long time. And that's why we are doing what we can, and we're at the initial stages of gearing up our ability to distribute those EV-related parts. The reality is the aftermarket for EV vehicle parts is nascent, but there's nobody in a better position to distribute those parts than LKQ."

And then longer term, related to price, now that the OEMs took a price and I saw that you guys followed very rationally, is there maybe a backdrop for the OEMs become more rational taking up price going forward, knowing that you're going to follow and maybe the whole market can be more rational passing through some of these costs in North America?"

With regards to inflationary pressures, let's be clear about it, no one  is immune to them at this point of time, okay? It's not just us, it's not just the OEMs, it's across every pretty much sector across the economy. So t",390,"Daniel, let me answer that one. With regards to inflationary pressures, let's be clear about it, no one  is immune to them at this point of time, okay? It's not just us, it's not just the OEMs, it's across every pretty much sector across the economy. So that's kind of point number one. It's just a fact of life at this point of time. 
The second one is, yes, folks that are acting on a rational basis, they're trying to protect margins. You've obviously seen 2 of the 3 big OEMs report in the last 48 hours, and as to what they've been talking about with regards to chip shortages and as to what's happening to new car sales and stuff. But yes, there's less discounting taking place within their markets also. And obviously, I think you follow some of the auto retailers also, so in terms of what's happening out there. 
So at this point of time, given the scarcity of being able to get product in, given the supply chain challenges, we expect folks are acting on a rational basis because no one really knows, as of now, how long the supply chain congestion is expected to last. So if someone does want to not act on a rational basis for a week, 2 weeks, a month, a quarter, at some point of time, it will come back and bite him. 
It's no different to what we at LKQ did when the pandemic initially struck in Q1 of 2020, moved incredibly fast to kind of take care of what we could control, which was our cost structure. And that obviously has now morphed into inflation and also supply chain congestion. So we expect folks will be acting on a rational basis because no one really knows how long this is going to continue to last. 
And so what the OEMs may or may not do, listen, I can't speculate sitting out here, that is their call. We do know that what we at LKQ do and what we plan to do, given the market conditions, the key in all of this is to be nimble, is to be agile and to be dynamic and be able to react as an organization at relatively short notice. And just really happy with the way our teams continue to do that."

Can you maybe talk about how transitory you view these labor headwinds, how you're navigating the backdrop and whether you're having to add back any of those costs? Or is this just something to do with the demand you're seeing today?"

No, absolutely. And great question out there, Daniel. Yes, listen, 18 months ago, when the pandemic initially struck, it was a case of ensuring that our balance sheet and our cost structure was aligned to what the new demand forecast realities were, okay? And so as a distribution business, we were able to move quick. And as that dragged on, I think before the end of the second quarter of 2020, we've actually moved those temporary reductions into permanent reductions. And I think folks appreciated what we did. 
At this point of time, it is all demand-related, whether it be in Europe, whether it be in North America or for that matter in our Specialty segment. And that piece is being exacerbated by the fact that there's just a real shortage of talent. 
Nick talked about, say, for example, on the delivery side. It's the same thing across the business. Because as of now folks have kind of moved on to online in a pretty big way, and so warehouse demand, warehouse folk demand has been strong. And so from that perspective and the talent and the labor shortages, we're having to pay up. And we will do so because that is the kind of core of our business. 
So with regards to it being transitory or not, this is where the reality is. Unlike commodity prices, fuel or metals or whatever it is, there could be certain spikes and drops within their cycle, wages are notoriously sticky. Once you've been paying at a certain rate, you can't go back 3 months or 6 months later and say, ""Oh, actually, you know what? Now there's a different situation and now this is what we will be doing."" That is just not the way to drive trust in what we call our single most valuable asset. So that is not what we do. 
Yes, what we do, do is here at LKQ, we have a very strong value proposition for being part of the LKQ family, whether it be our retirement plan offerings, whether it be our health care benefits, [ institution reinvestments ], the scholarships and many of those kind of pieces. And yes, we are also doing certain one-off items, all in all, to try and ensure that the entire overall base doesn't move into the future literally dollar for dollar. So there are certain elements which we believe are going to drive talent retention, rather than someone wanting to move just for the next extra dollar or 2 as such. But that's really how we're thinking about it."

This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our outlook for the balance of 2021, before I come back with a few closing remarks.  
This was another quarter of significant operating progress at LKQ, driven by excellent execution in delivering solid financial performance, all while navigating the challenges with the supply chain and the current cost environment. We were able to produce yet another record quarter, and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with the highest EPS reported in their respective quarters. The third quarter also reflects the second time we've been able to achieve more than $1 of earnings per share on an adjusted basis and reflects the highest third quarter segment EBITDA margin in the history of the company.  
We are particularly pleased that our European business delivered its highest segment EBITDA level in over 9 years, exceeding the 11% level. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly.  
While I recognize the listeners are primarily focused on the financial results, I know our performance is a reflection of the dedication and effort of our 45,000 team members around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers. I hope you can appreciate that I am more excited about the performance of my team than the quarterly results as they are the key to continued excellence.  
With respect to capital allocation, as you hopefully read from our press release issued this morning, I am very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has declared the company's first-ever quarterly cash dividend. This dividend declaration and our existing stock repurchase program are key components of our strategic plan to drive total long-term returns for our stockholders. Our solid balance sheet and sustainable cash flow generation, coupled with our leading market positions across our operating segments, provide us with the opportunity to execute on that plan. The quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on December 2, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 11.  
Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 8.2% as compared to the $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020.  
During the third quarter, total parts and services revenue increased 6%, comprising organic growth of 4%, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increasing revenue by 0.5% and foreign exchange rates increasing revenue by 1.5%.  Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $284 million as compared to $194 million for the same period last year, an increase of 46.4%.  Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.96 a share as compared to $0.64 a share for the same period of 2020, an increase of 50%.  
On an adjusted basis, net income in the third quarter was $300 million compared to $228 million in the same period of 2020, a 31.6% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.02 as compared to $0.75 for the same period of 2020, a 36% increase.  
Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the revenue trends for the quarter, and you can see growth rates improved year-over-year for all segments. The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets continued to improve; but as we progressed throughout the quarter, we started to face headwinds related to the rise in the Delta variant and also challenges with the aftermarket supply chain, both of which impacted organic growth across each of the segments.  
Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the third quarter was 8.6% above the prior year and 1.3% below the third quarter of 2019. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 5.9% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.  When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims this quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the third quarter of 2019.  
During Q3, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 7% on a per day basis relative to 2019 levels, while repairable claims declined 10.6%, so it was another period of outperformance for our North American operations. During the third quarter, our salvage business and the growth of our major mechanical product groups had solid performance. Although fill rates have been challenged, we are witnessing a positive offset from our quote conversion rates on salvage parts. Importantly, as we progressed through the third quarter and entered Q4, we've witnessed an increase in availability of the auctions, and prices are moderating versus what we experienced earlier in the year.  
Also, Elitek, our diagnostic and calibration services business, continued to exceed our expectations, with September being the highest monthly level of diagnostic scans since building out this business, a clear sign that shops and carriers are embracing this unique service offering.  For those on the call that will be attending the SEMA event next week, Elitek will have a presence at the show. So please come visit, and you can see why we are excited about this growth opportunity.  
Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter increased 0.1% on a reported basis and 0.3% on a per day basis.  When compared to the third quarter of 2019, our European revenue was down just 1% on a per day basis. So we have made progress on getting back to pre-pandemic levels and are optimistic we will move ahead of the 2019 levels in the next quarter or 2.  
From an overall mobility perspective, virtually every European market experienced flat growth in the quarter, which we believe is a sign that the spike we witnessed in the second quarter due to the reopening of the economy subsided sequentially in Q3.  Our regional operations continued to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter. Our Eastern European business had the strongest recovery despite a very competitive pricing environment. Germany and the Benelux markets also delivered well above total segment growth. The drag in growth was primarily driven by negative growth in Italy, a market that continues to face very difficult conditions.  
Other items to note in Europe would include the fact that on September 6, we celebrated the grand opening of our new Innovation and Service Center in Katowice, Poland that began operations earlier in the quarter. Also, on October 1, just after the close of the third quarter, we acquired a company named Hamu, which operates 9 locations in the Central Netherlands region. With over 100 employees, Hamu is one of the largest independent automotive parts wholesalers in the Netherlands.  
Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which again delivered solid performance during the third quarter by reporting organic revenue growth on a same-day basis of 13.7%. As witnessed in the first half of the year, the drivers of this ongoing performance continued to be strong demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks as well as our drop-ship business.  
On October 1, we finalized the acquisition of SeaWide Marine Distribution, a nationwide electronics wholesale distributor that supplies electrical and electronic products for the marine, outdoor and personal navigation markets. This acquisition is consistent with the strategy of entering adjacent markets that Bill Rogers highlighted during our 2020 Investor Day.  
Marine products overlapped nicely with our RV and towing product portfolio. Importantly, SeaWide now has the benefit of leveraging our network of 8 specialty distribution centers in over 40 cross-docks that are strategically located to provide next-day service throughout North America. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the total addressable market for the wholesale product SeaWide offers is over $3 billion.  
Lastly, I want to acknowledge and congratulate the Specialty team for being recognized as the RV Industry Association Distributor of the Year at the recent 2021 RV Aftermarket Conference in Atlanta, a tremendous accomplishment.  
In addition to the Hamu and Seawide Marine acquisitions, other corporate development transactions included divesting all of our equity interest in a very small joint venture in the U.K.  And acquiring a business in the United States that remanufactures torque converters, a product used in the remanufacturing of automatic transmissions.  
The global supply chain continues to be under duress. It is widely known that, today, a record number of ships are anchored off the coast of California waiting for port lanes to unload containers, some of which hold our aftermarket inventory and are eventually headed to LKQ facilities. High demand for overseas products, congestions within the ports and at the rail hubs and a severe shortage of truck drivers, has led to delays and increased cost for ocean and land freight, both in North America and in Europe. The recent initiatives across the globe to begin tackling components of these route issues, such as the measures implemented by the Port of Los Angeles on October 12, are encouraging. But we expect overarching supply chain issues to persist in the near to midterm. We are doing our best to effectively navigate the difficult environment, and we are hopeful that we won't be talking about the supply chain challenges and reading draconian headlines on a daily basis at this time next year.  
Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and to help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract.  
Now a brief update on some of our ongoing ESG efforts. During the quarter, we established the LKQ Cares ESG Advisory Committee, which is comprised of key leaders across our company. The purpose of the committee is to support and provide advice regarding LKQ Corporation's ongoing commitment to environmental matters, social responsibility, corporate governance and many other public policies relevant to our company.  
Additionally, with inclusion being a core value at LKQ, I am excited to announce that LKQ has joined the Second Chance Business Coalition, a nationwide effort to create economic opportunity for approximately 78 million Americans trying to get back on their feet and contribute to society. We are proud to be alongside 35 other large public and private companies that also believe that supporting those seeking a second chance in life not only provides opportunities for the individual but also for their families and for their communities. It's simply the right thing to do.  
Lastly, as you may have read, we are both humbled and honored that LKQ North America has been recognized by WorkBuzz, an independent global employee engagement firm as a 5-Star Employer after receiving positive feedback from our first-ever employee engagement survey. Part of our mission statement is to build strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. And this award validates that our inclusive and engaged teams are proudly carrying this mission forward.  
And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong third quarter financial performance."
4303924,1684611545,2415693,"LKQ Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued evidence of the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives we instituted a few years ago.  Record profitability and continued robust free c",1979,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued evidence of the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives we instituted a few years ago.  Record profitability and continued robust free cash flow just don't happen by accident. The team's focus on getting the fundamentals right, continuous improvement and winning each day has driven these strong results under what are incredibly challenging conditions, with a congested supply chain and strong inflationary pressures.  
I'd like to start with a few highlights before getting into the details. As you heard from Nick, Europe achieved segment EBITDA of 11.5% for the quarter. This gives us the confidence to narrow the full year segment EBITDA range for 2021 further to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively lifting the floor by a further 30 basis points.  Specialty delivered yet another excellent organic revenue quarter at 13.7% despite the ongoing supply chain challenges. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of robust double-digit organic revenue growth for the segment.  Cash flow generation remains strong. And the conversion ratio relative to earnings continues to be above our long-term expectation despite a challenging environment.  
The share repurchase program carried on with a further 4.3 million shares purchased in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 12 million shares and the program to date of 29.3 million shares repurchased.  And finally, the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend reflects the confidence in our strategy and the strength of our business, underscoring our commitment to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.  
Now I'll move to the consolidated financial results. As Nick described, Q3 was another successful quarter with growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, cash flow and earnings per share.  Gross margin was again a highlight for the quarter, increasing 150 basis points relative to the prior year. We continue to feel pressure on input costs across each of our segments, but we have been able to mitigate the effects by being nimble to adjust to the new reality of higher input costs by adjusting pricing. Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices, although at a much lower level than we've seen in prior quarters.  
Car costs remain relatively high. And with the moderation of precious metal prices in the quarter as seen on Slide 27, the benefit dipped relative to the first half of the year. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $12 million in segment EBITDA and $0.03 in adjusted EPS relative to last year. As a reminder, this benefit is well below the $57 million in segment EBITDA and $0.14 in adjusted EPS from metal prices experienced in the second quarter of 2021.  
Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by personnel costs. The tight labor market has pushed wages higher in many of our markets. Additionally, strong performance across all 3 segments is contributing to increased levels of incentive compensation in 2021, which represents 30 basis points of higher expense. Other overhead expenses are slightly favorable, as we're offsetting inflation in freight and fuel through operating efficiencies and leverage from higher scrap and core revenue.  
I'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced an EBITDA margin of 17.3% for the quarter, down 30 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin was favorable by 60 basis points, primarily coming out of the ongoing margin initiatives in the wholesale business and improved pricing. Self-service increased gross margin dollars compared to 2020 but generated a lower margin percentage due to an increase in car cost and moderating metal prices. Segment overhead expenses increased by 100 basis points, with the largest change owing to personnel expenses. Roughly half of the increase is attributable to wages and temporary labor, with the remainder in higher incentive compensation. At the segment EBITDA line, the metals prices benefit noted previously generated 20 basis points of improvement relative to last year.  
I previously mentioned Europe's strong margin for the quarter, and Slide 11 shows the details. Adjusted gross margin increased by 240 basis points to the highest level in recent years, primarily owing to better net pricing while overhead expenses grew by 30 basis points, driven by higher wages and incentive compensation.  
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty grew EBITDA dollars though experienced 100 basis points of dilution in margin. The primary factors contributing to the decrease are: one, higher incentive compensation; inflationary pressures in the segment's 1 operations, which are behind the 30 basis point decrease in gross margin; and finally, duplicative costs associated with acquisitions done in the current fiscal year, which we expect to be transitory as the team integrates the acquired businesses over the remainder of the year and into early 2022.  
Similar to the first half of 2021, we are also delivering benefits from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes in April of this year created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added roughly $0.06 per share to our third quarter results. and based on the characteristics of these initiatives, are expected to continue to deliver over multiple periods. Additionally, income from our equity method and other investments generated a further $0.02 of year-over-year growth.  Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.25% to 25.75%, which contributed to a $0.04 per share year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.  
So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $1.02 is a $0.27 increase over the third quarter of 2020; the commodity benefits, as previously stated, were $0.03; investments generated a further $0.02; the tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.10 of the improvement; the remaining $0.12 comes from our operating performance, by far the single largest contributor to the results.  
Shifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We continued the trend of robust cash flow generation in the third quarter with $429 million of operating cash flow and $384 million of free cash flow. Our conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow was a very strong 84%, roughly in line with our year-to-date ratio, as seen on Slide 14. Our operating cash flows were driven by cash earnings and favorable movement in trade working capital balances.  Payables represented an inflow for the quarter as we benefit from extended payment terms, including our European vendor financing initiative.  
Inventory was an outflow of $60 million for the quarter. But similar to the second quarter, we were unable to increase our purchasing to the designed level owing to the supply chain issues that are affecting many sectors of the economy. We are actively working to rebuild inventory levels, and we believe that our excellent relationships with suppliers and liquidity on hand puts us in a good position to acquire the needed inventory when supply chain congestion finally eases.  
We deployed the free cash flow to repurchase 4.3 million shares in the quarter for $219 million, acquired 2 tuck-in businesses for $37 million and repaid $23 million in outstanding borrowings. Our net leverage ratio dropped to 1.1x EBITDA, and interest coverage now exceeds 24x compared to the credit facility requirements of 4.25x and 3x, respectively. Or said differently, at this point in time, we do not need to devote further capital towards paying debt, and as you saw in the third quarter results also.   
With $1.6 billion in availability on our credit facility and approximately $400 million in cash, we have over $2 billion in liquidity to fund our strategic objectives. The liquidity amount is roughly $800 million below our December 31, 2020 figure, reflecting the use of liquidity to redeem the 2026 EUR 0.75 billion euro notes, prepay our outstanding term loan balance of $319 million as well as the termination of the $110 million receivable securitization program earlier this year in July. We felt comfortable reducing the overall capacity owing to our ability to sustainably generate robust free cash flow.  
As you can imagine, we have carefully considered our liquidity position and future cash flow generation prospects in reaching the decision to initiate the quarterly cash dividend. We are confident in the company's ability to convert earnings to free cash flow in a ratio of 55% to 60% on a long-term basis, which provides us with sufficient cash to fund a dividend while continuing to repurchase shares, reinvest in the business and make accretive acquisitions.  
Initiating a dividend is an important milestone in the company's history and reflects the Board and the management team's confidence in our near- and long-term prospects. The decision to pay a dividend is consistent with, and does not change, our approach to capital allocation, which prioritizes growth investments and return excess cash to shareholders to enhance their returns. Our share repurchase program will run in tandem with the dividend program as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation.  
I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on the full year 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which that assume that there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets or foreign exchange rates and scrap and precious metal prices hold near recent levels in the remainder of the year.  
The first statement being, with yet another excellent quarter in Q3, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.78 to $3.88 with a midpoint of $3.83. This is an increase of $0.18 or 5% at the midpoint over our prior quarter guidance and an increase of $1.08 or 39% relative to our original 2021 full year guidance. The increases reflect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment, which have allowed us to mitigate strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs prevalent throughout the industry.  
While we expect our operational performance in Q4 to play out roughly in line with prior guidance, we are projecting a negative impact of roughly $0.02 a share, resulting from metal prices as these move lower going into the fourth quarter. As you think about the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020, we are forecasting a $0.07 per share negative year-over-year effect related to sequential movements in metal prices. Additionally, having 1 fewer selling day in the North America and Specialty segments in the fourth quarter of 2021 creates a further $0.02 headwind. A lower share count and tax rate in 2021 should mitigate some of the year-over-year headwinds.  
The second statement I would like to share with everyone is we are narrowing the range for full year European segment EBITDA margin to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively raising the floor by a further 30 basis points, similar to what we did roughly 90 days ago following the second quarter earnings.  
And finally, we continue to generate outstanding free cash flow through strong profitability and judicious use of trade working capital. With this in mind, along with higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion, with $1.225 billion at the midpoint.  
Despite the supply chain challenges, we still anticipate an inventory increase in the fourth quarter, ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand, although not to the level assumed in prior guidance, as a portion of the build would likely be deferred into 2022.  
With that, thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments."

Great question, Bret.

And I will tell you that our Elitek margins are well ahead of our parts distribution margins, and it requires relatively little capital. So the return on invested capital is very attractive, very attractive. 
Again, this is still a relatively small business for us, kind of in and around that $50 million range. But our goal is to grow it very, very rapidly, not by orders of 5% or 10% a year, but our goal would be to multiply the size of the business over the next several years. 
It will probably never be a $1 billion or $2 billion business for us, but it's a great adjacency at really attractive margins and, probably most importantly, a really good return on invested capital."

COVID clearly has thrown everybody some curveballs, it has thrown out some curveballs. Some things just got delayed a little bit. Other things got accelerated. Originally, the Innovation and Service Center in Katowice, Poland was later in our plan, and we actually pulled that forward.

The ERP implementation got pushed back effectively by a quarter or 2.

The big issue with the supply chain, and this is not unique to LKQ, it's not unique to our industry, right? The fact of the matter is out in California, there's 80 ships anchored, waiting for a berth in the ports. If you did that on a national basis,",401,"Yes. The big issue with the supply chain, and this is not unique to LKQ, it's not unique to our industry, right? The fact of the matter is out in California, there's 80 ships anchored, waiting for a berth in the ports. If you did that on a national basis, I think you're somewhere around 100 ships. Many of those ships have our product -- our containers sitting on it, right? 
And it's not just an issue with the ports. The reality is there's a lot of data out there that's showing that there's just not enough truckers turning up to get the containers out of the ports. There's a severe shortage of drivers. Most folks estimate this country is down about 80,000 truck drivers. The warehouses where the containers ultimately need to go are clogged. And importantly, containers get put on a chassis, which is then connected to the tractor of the semi-tractor combination, there's a severe shortage of chassis available. 
So the supply chain is a bit of a mess completely. And so yes, it's taking much longer for us to get our product, say from Taiwan into the United States. It's costing us some more money. It's important to recognize that the inventory is ours when it hits the port in Taiwan. So that's our inventory, not the supplier's inventory, sitting out on the water. And so we're being very thoughtful as to putting in advance orders, making sure we can do whatever we can to get the inventory that we need. 
The bad news is we're not -- we don't have the inventory levels that we prefer. The good news is we think we're doing significantly better than our small competitors. I mean think about it, we bring in 16,000 containers a year, that's about 300 a week, from the Far East for our North American aftermarket parts business. Our small competitors, they'd be lucky if they bring in 300 a year or even 50 a year. So we feel we're -- from a fulfillment rate basis, we're doing much better than the small competitors.

Let me take this one. So essentially, the innovation center is effectively what we had talked about as part of the 1 LKQ Europe Program of setting up a lower-cost shared service center, no different to global business services at other companies. 
Within the industry but also among broader companies, having a lower-cost back office to do commoditized transaction processing, but also, in the case of Poland, we believe there is some good digital and technology talent. And that really is the background to what we're trying to do from a Katowice perspective. 
As you know, we obviously have Bangalore. And now putting up another center certainly gives us the geographic breadth, language capabilities, not just to do some of the more, I'd say, regularly expected back-office activities, but also to invest in things such as digital. We clearly know that while B2B and the different market, the do-it-for-me market, is clearly the biggest piece serving Europe, but there is some adjacency associated with B2C. And being able to do some of that back-office work and the technology work out of Katowice in Poland, which does have talent, we believe there is some goodness associated with it. That really is the backdrop to the Katowice, Poland innovation center."

Actually, let me take that one. So yes, within -- in the third quarter, as I called out, the total metals benefit, both scrap and catalytic inverter, so precious metals, was about $12 million or roughly about $0.03 within the $1.02 of adjusted EPS. Relative to what we experienced in the first half of the year, if you recall, in Q1, it was a $34 million upside; in Q2 was roughly $57 million, so significant upside. 
But really, what we saw come through was starting in September, we saw scrap metal prices, but also more to the point, precious metal prices began to drop pretty significantly. And so that piece, despite the fact that those metal prices were dropping, car costs remained relatively high. And so the overall metals benefit was muted. 
And really what we've seen exiting September, as we've shown on Slide #27 also for the benefit of everybody, you see that bigger slide begin to take place in September. And so from a Q4 forecast perspective, we are actually, as of now, anticipating that to be a negative impact from metals pricing rather than an ongoing benefit. 
So if you think about the first half versus the second half, in the first half, we said we pretty much got close to, I'd say, $90 million of EBITDA from metals, be it precious or scrap. In the third quarter, it was about $12 million, which kind of gives you a year-to-date of about $103 million. And in the fourth quarter, we see an unwind of anything up to $30 million taking place. So that's how you should think about it. Clearly, it's a volatile market as of now. Things are changing on a daily, weekly basis, but that's how we think about the metals pricing, which underpins our forecast that we've provided."

Obviously, the aftermarket part availability is constrained a bit because of all the supply chain challenges we've already talked about. Salvage parts come from the local markets, right? We buy total loss vehicles locally, we dismantle them locally and then we can distribute on a local basis. And there absolutely has been a bit of a shift. And I would say this primarily benefits us relative to anybody else because we are the only company that can offer both salvaged and recycled product and the aftermarket collision parts. And so we have absolutely are seeing our -- the growth in our salvage business in the quarter and actually for the last few quarters has been well above the growth and the revenue trends in the aftermarket product. 
And part of that is due to the strong mechanical business, engines and transmissions, that we talked about in our formal comments. And part of it is this ability to, in certain times, shift the customer from an aftermarket product that we may not have an inventory to a salvage product that we can get to them same day or next day. So the salvage business has been very good. And again, we're the only company in this country that offers both product lines."

No, broadly, we are, we're maybe in the top of the first in the whole EV marketplace and the transition and the like. So there are no big trends. There are no shifts. 
What we will tell you is that when you look at hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, technical service parts command anywhere from a 2x to 6x premium relative to their comparable internal combustion engine counterparts. And there's a number of reasons for that. One is the technical complexity, not just with batteries, but also with the electrification of components previously belt-driven such as air conditioning, compressors and water pumps. 
For an example, this is just one example. A 2013 Prius with an electric water pump, that water pump sells for 3x the value of a 2013 Corolla that has a belt-driven water pump. In the U.K., for example, a 2017 Golf with an internal combustion engine, that water pump sells for about GBP 77. The Lexus hybrid EV, the water pump is GBP 278. 
And so yes, the EV parts are much more expensive. We think that's going to continue to be the case for a long, long time. And that's why we are doing what we can, and we're at the initial stages of gearing up our ability to distribute those EV-related parts. The reality is the aftermarket for EV vehicle parts is nascent, but there's nobody in a better position to distribute those parts than LKQ."

And then longer term related to price, now that the OEMs took a price and I saw that you guys followed very rationally, is there maybe a backdrop for the OEMs become more rational taking up price going forward, knowing that you're going to follow and maybe the whole market can be more rational passing through some of these costs in North America?"

With regards to inflationary pressures, let's be clear about it, no one is immune to them at this point of time, okay? It's not just us, it's not just the OEMs, it's across every pretty much sector across the economy. So th",389,"Daniel, let me answer that one. With regards to inflationary pressures, let's be clear about it, no one is immune to them at this point of time, okay? It's not just us, it's not just the OEMs, it's across every pretty much sector across the economy. So that's kind of point number one. It's just a fact of life at this point of time. 
The second one is, yes, folks that are acting on a rational basis, they're trying to protect margins. You've obviously seen 2 of the 3 big OEMs report in the last 48 hours, and as to what they've been talking about with regards to chip shortages and as to what's happening to new car sales and stuff. But yes, there's less discounting taking place within their markets also. And obviously, I think you follow some of the auto retailers also in terms of what's happening out there. 
So at this point of time, given the scarcity of being able to get product in, given the supply chain challenges, we expect folks are acting on a rational basis because no one really knows, as of now, how long the supply chain congestion is expected to last. So if someone does want to not act on a rational basis for a week, 2 weeks, a month, a quarter, at some point of time, it will come back and bite him. 
It's no different to what we at LKQ did when the pandemic initially struck in Q1 of 2020, moved incredibly fast to kind of take care of what we could control, which was our cost structure. And that obviously has now morphed into inflation and also supply chain congestion. So we expect folks will be acting on a rational basis because no one really knows how long this is going to continue to last. 
And so what the OEMs may or may not do, listen, I can't speculate sitting out here, that is their call. We do know that what we at LKQ do and what we plan to do, given the market conditions, the key in all of this is to be nimble, is to be agile and to be dynamic and be able to react as an organization at relatively short notice. And just really happy with the way our teams continue to do that."

Can you maybe talk about how transitory you view these labor headwinds, how you're navigating the backdrop and whether you're having to add back any of those costs? Or is this just something to do with the demand you're seeing today?"

No, absolutely. And great question out there, Daniel. Yes, listen, 18 months ago, when the pandemic initially struck, it was a case of ensuring that our balance sheet and our cost structure was aligned to what the new demand forecast realities were, okay? And so as a distribution business, we were able to move quick. And as that dragged on, I think before the end of the second quarter of 2020, we actually moved those temporary reductions into permanent reductions. And I think folks appreciated what we did. 
At this point of time, it is all demand-related, whether it be in Europe, whether it be in North America or for that matter, in our Specialty segment. And that piece is being exacerbated by the fact that there's just a real shortage of talent. 
Nick talked about, say, for example, on the delivery side. It's the same thing across the business. Because as of now, folks have kind of moved on to online in a pretty big way, and so warehouse demand, warehouse folk demand has been strong. And so from that perspective and the talent and the labor shortages, we're having to pay up. And we will do so because that is the kind of core of our business. 
So with regards to it being transitory or not, this is where the reality is. Unlike commodity prices, fuel or metals or whatever it is, there could be certain spikes and drops within their cycle, wages are notoriously sticky. Once you've been paying at a certain rate, you can't go back 3 months or 6 months later and say, ""Oh, actually, you know what, now there's a different situation and now this is what we will be doing."" That is just not the way to drive trust in what we call our single most valuable asset. So that is not what we do. 
Yes, what we do, do is here at LKQ, we have a very strong value proposition for being part of the LKQ family, whether it be our retirement plan offerings, whether it be our health care benefits, the tuition reimbursements, the scholarships and many of those kind of pieces. And yes, we are also doing certain one-off items, all in all, to try and ensure that the entire overall base doesn't move into the future literally dollar for dollar. So there are certain elements which we believe are going to drive talent retention, rather than someone wanting to move just for the next extra dollar or 2 as such. But that's really how we're thinking about it."
